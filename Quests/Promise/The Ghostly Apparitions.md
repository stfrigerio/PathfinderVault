# Prologo

Strange ghostly apparitions begin to haunt the academy, causing disruptions and fear among the students. The players are tasked with investigating the ghostly phenomenon and uncovering the reasons behind the hauntings. Through their investigations, they discover a forgotten history of Promise Academy and the restless spirits connected to the school's past. The players must find a way to appease the spirits and bring peace to the academy.

## Hooks


```ad-help
title: Mysterious Manifestations

The players witness a ghostly encounter firsthand, such as objects moving on their own, flickering lights, or eerie whispers in the corridors. This draws their attention and curiosity, prompting them to investigate the source of these disturbances.

**Amias' Apparitions and Disturbances**:
- *Whispers of Forgotten Knowledge*: Students studying late at night might hear whispers of arcane theory that seem to come from nowhere. The whispers are often complex magical concepts far beyond the student's current level of understanding, reflecting Amias' advanced knowledge and his desire to share it. 
- *Mysterious Script*: Parchments, books, and scrolls in the library might be found with an additional, almost transparent layer of handwriting overlaying the original text. These addenda are always in an old, scholarly script and offer corrections or expansions on the text. This reflects Amias' role as a scholar and his regret over his lost grimoire. 
- *Ghostly Lectures*: In the quiet hours, one might hear a soft voice giving a lecture in an empty classroom. The lecture is always deeply insightful but ends abruptly, followed by a mournful sigh.
- *Lost Knowledge Manifested*: During a critical examination or experiment by the students, an essential piece of arcane knowledge or formula might be missing, potentially leading to disastrous results. Suddenly, an ethereal hand appears, writing the correct formula or guiding the process correctly on a nearby chalkboard or piece of parchment. This not only saves the situation but also provides a poignant reminder of Amias' deep understanding of magic and his desire to help students avoid the fatal mistake he made.


**Morwen's Apparitions and Disturbances**: 
- *Echoes of Anguish*: Students might hear a woman's sobbing echoing through the halls late at night, reflecting Morwen's sorrow and anger over her ill treatment and the injustice done to her. 
- *Messages of Vengeance*: In a chilling spectacle, messages appear on walls or windows when the temperature drops, appearing as if written in frost. The messages are often accusatory, blaming the staff for their negligence or cruelty. 
- *Distorted Reflections*: Mirrors in the academy sometimes show distorted reflections, showing the viewer appearing sad or scared. It's a reflection of Morwen's emotional state during her time at the academy, and her wish for others to understand her pain.
- *Flashback Apparition*: In a particularly tense moment, the academy's occupants might suddenly find themselves witnessing a spectral reenactment of Morwen's final days. They see her enduring the cruel taunts and insinuations of her peers, her pleas for help ignored, and her growing despair. This chilling scene leaves no doubt about the deep pain and anger that Morwen carries, causing a stir among the staff and students and forcing them to confront the academy's dark past.  

**Eadric's Apparitions and Disturbances**:
- *Unseen Pranks*: Mischievous incidents occur around the academy - books flying off shelves, ink pots spilling on their own, or gusts of wind blowing through closed rooms. These pranks are Eadric's attempts to lighten the mood and distract himself from his existential dilemma. 
- *Laughter in the Library*: A sudden peal of laughter might echo through the library, often following a particularly amusing passage in a book someone is reading. It's a reflection of Eadric's love for humor and his desire to find joy even in his spectral existence. 
- *Invisible Companion*: A student might feel an unseen presence sitting next to them, making comments or jokes about their studies. It's Eadric trying to engage and connect in the only way he can, reflecting his friendly, sociable nature.
- *Phantasmagoric Fireworks*: In the middle of the night, students and staff are roused by the sudden burst of ghostly fireworks in the sky above the academy. The spectacle is unlike anything they've seen before - the lights are ethereal and radiant, forming intricate shapes and arcane symbols. The display is accompanied by Eadric's hearty laughter, echoing through the grounds. As the last of the fireworks fades away, Eadric's spectral figure appears, taking a grandiose bow to the awestruck spectators.
