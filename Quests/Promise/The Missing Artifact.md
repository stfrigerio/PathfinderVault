## Prologue

The players receive a request for assistance from Professor Elara Swiftbrook, who informs them that a powerful magical artifact has gone missing from the academy's vault. She reveals that the artifact, known as the Everflame Crystal, possesses the ability to enhance magical abilities and is crucial for the academy's research and educational purposes. The professor suspects the involvement of a secretive group of students who have been acting suspiciously.

>"Hey there, students! I need to talk to you about something. You know that super powerful artifact we had locked up tight in our vaults? Yeah, well, turns out it's gone missing. Poof! Vanished into thin air."
>
>"Now, I don't want to sound dramatic, but this is a big deal. The missing artifact is called the [[Everflame Crystal]], and it's kind of a big deal around here. It's got some serious magical power and can really amp up our students' magical abilities. So, you can imagine, we're all pretty preoccupied."
>
>"But here's where you come in! I've heard whispers about a secret group of students who might be involved in this mess. Sneaky little devils, they are. We need you to dig up the dirt, find their secret meeting spot, and figure out what they're up to. Get to the bottom of this mystery, you know?"
>
>"Once you've got the evidence, we need you to confront their leader. Try to reason with them, show 'em the error of their ways. We don't want any harm coming to the academy or the students, okay?"
>
>"I've seen you all in action before, and you're the best we've got. Smart, resourceful, and not afraid to get your hands dirty. So, I'm countin' on you to crack this case and retrieve that Everflame Crystal. Promise Academy's reputation is on the line, and we can't let it go down the drain."
>
>"Keep me in the loop with any findings or progress. Time's ticking, so don't dawdle! Show those sneaky students what you're made of and bring that artifact back where it belongs. The future of Promise Academy is in your hands, my trusty students!"

>>[!question]- Why she suspects of a secret group of students?
>> 1.  **Whisperings and Rumors:** The professor has been hearing whispers and rumors among the students, suggesting the existence of a clandestine group with an interest in powerful artifacts. While these murmurs may be vague, they have sparked her curiosity and led her to investigate further.
>> 2.  **Unusual Student Behavior:** Professor Swiftbrook has observed certain students acting suspiciously or displaying behavior that raises eyebrows. These students have been seen frequenting restricted areas of the academy or engaging in secretive conversations, fueling the professor's suspicions. 
>> 3.  **Missing Student Reports:** Several students who were known to possess the ability to access the vault or were associated with the security protocols around the Everflame Crystal have been reported missing or have suddenly withdrawn from the academy without a valid explanation. This pattern raises concerns about their potential involvement in the artifact's disappearance.
>> 4.  **Unexplained Disruptions:** The academy has experienced unexplained disruptions and incidents coinciding with the timeframe of the artifact's disappearance. These incidents range from small magical disturbances to temporary disruptions in the school's security systems. While not conclusive evidence, they contribute to the professor's belief that there may be an organized group at work.
>> 
>> While these pieces of evidence do not definitively prove the existence or involvement of a secret group of students, they have led Professor Swiftbrook to harbor strong suspicions. She believes that a concerted effort is underway to conceal the truth behind the Everflame Crystal's disappearance, prompting her to seek the aid of the players to investigate further and gather more concrete evidence.
>
>> [!question]- What is the reward of this quest?
>> As a token of gratitude and recognition for their invaluable assistance in recovering the Everflame Crystal and unraveling the secrets surrounding its disappearance, Professor Elara Swiftbrook offers the players a significant reward. Here are a few options for potential rewards:
>> 1.  **Academic Distinctions:** The players are granted honorary titles or prestigious positions within Promise Academy. They become respected figures among the faculty and students, gaining access to exclusive resources, libraries, and research facilities. They are welcomed as guest lecturers and can freely consult with the academy's scholars for future endeavors.
>> 2. **Magical Artifacts or Knowledge:** Professor Swiftbrook shares rare and coveted magical artifacts, scrolls, or tomes from the academy's archives as a gesture of appreciation. These items could provide the players with new spells, unique abilities, or insights into esoteric magical practices. Such treasures are invaluable assets in their future adventures.
>> 3.  **Recommendations and Connections:** The professor uses her influence and network to provide the players with letters of recommendation and introductions to influential individuals within the magical community. These connections open doors to new opportunities, such as apprenticeships with renowned spellcasters, invitations to exclusive magical societies, or access to prestigious magical academies around the world.
>> 4.  **Scholarships and Sponsorship:** Promise Academy offers the players scholarships, covering their tuition and expenses for further studies within the academy. They are granted the opportunity to continue their education under the guidance of renowned professors and mentors, allowing them to refine their magical skills and pursue their individual interests.
>> 5.  **Gratitude and Friendship:** Above all, Professor Swiftbrook expresses her heartfelt gratitude and forms a lasting friendship with the players. She becomes an ally, mentor, and source of support, always willing to provide guidance, advice, or assistance whenever they require it. This bond can lead to future collaborations, quests, and shared endeavors.
>>
>>The specific reward chosen will depend on the players' preferences, their characters' aspirations, and the overall campaign's direction. Professor Swiftbrook's reward not only acknowledges the players' accomplishments but also opens doors to new possibilities, empowering them for future challenges and further weaving their destinies into the tapestry of Promise Academy.
>
>> [!question]- Where should we start looking?
>> To begin their investigation into the disappearance of the Everflame Crystal, Professor Elara Swiftbrook advises the players to focus their attention on the following areas:
>> 1.  **The Academy Vault:** The players should start by examining the site where the artifact was last known to be storedâ€”the highly secured academy vault. They can investigate for signs of forced entry, tampering with security measures, or any anomalies that may have occurred during the time of the theft. Speaking to the vault's guards or security personnel could provide valuable insights.
>> 2.  **Student Hangouts and Gatherings:** The players should discreetly observe and interact with students in popular hangouts, common rooms, or clubs. By engaging in casual conversations or listening to discussions, they might overhear hints or rumors regarding the missing artifact or the existence of the secret group.
>>
>>By exploring these key areas and gathering information from various sources within Promise Academy, the players can piece together the puzzle surrounding the missing artifact and uncover the truth behind the secret group's involvement. Each lead they follow and every connection they make brings them closer to the resolution of the mystery.

>[!info]- The Academy Vault
>Within the depths of the Cerulean Caveu, the entrance to the Academy Vault stands as an imposing set of intricately carved, reinforced doors made of polished mahogany. Adorned with protective runes and symbols, these doors hint at the formidable enchantments that lie beyond. Two massive keyholes suggest the need for multiple keys to gain access, adding an extra layer of security.
>
>Upon entering, the players are greeted by a spacious chamber with tall, arched ceilings. The walls are lined with shelves made of sturdy oak, each meticulously labeled and organized to accommodate a wide array of magical artifacts. Ethereal lighting emanates from enchanted sconces, casting a warm glow that illuminates the room.
>
>The temperature within the vault is carefully regulated, maintaining an ideal environment for the preservation of delicate magical items. The air carries a faint aroma of ancient parchment, intermingled with the residual essence of potent enchantments. Protective spells intricately woven into the vault's structure further safeguard its contents, ensuring that only authorized individuals may access them.
>
>Within the vault, the players see rows upon rows of carefully sealed glass cases and display stands. These encasements house various magical artifacts, each labeled with informative plaques that provide historical context and details about their unique properties. Some of the items are protected by additional magical barriers, making them inaccessible to anyone without the proper authorization.
>
>At the far end of the vault, on a raised pedestal, once stood the Everflame Crystal. However, now there is a noticeable void in its place, an empty space that echoes the absence of its radiant presence. The pedestal bears markings indicating where the artifact once rested, its absence a testament to the mysterious nature of its disappearance.
>
>The overall atmosphere of the vault is one of reverence and awe. The players can't help but feel a sense of the academy's rich magical history as they stand amidst such a vast collection of arcane wonders. Yet, the missing Everflame Crystal serves as a stark reminder that even the most secure of places can fall prey to cunning thieves or hidden agendas.
