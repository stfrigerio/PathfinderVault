![[Bound_genie.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A bound genie.
> While any [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]] capable of casting *[[Planar ally|planar ally]]*, *[[Planar binding|planar binding]]*, and *binding* spells can [[Magic/Conjuration|conjure]] and bind [[Genie|genies]], the true **genie binder** is a spellcaster who has devoted his life to the pursuit of this practice. Most genie binders study the works of [[Sulesh the Great]] religiously, but the best of them understand that even Sulesh was not infallible, and use his works as stepping stones to further perfect the act of genie binding.
> While most genies abhor the act of [[Binding outsiders|binding]] and bottling, many have an odd appreciation and respect for actual genie binders. Nothing delights an [[Efreet|efreeti]] more than to see a [[Djinn|djinni]] ensnared, for example, and the [[Janni|janni]] are quite pleased to see their elder brothers and sisters brought low.
