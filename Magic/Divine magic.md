> **Divine magic** is one of three types, or four [[Magical tradition|traditions]], of [[Magic|magic]], along with [[Arcane|arcane]], [[Occult|occult]]/[[Psychic magic|psychic magic]] and [[Primal magic|primal magic]], that manifests in the form of [[Spell|spells]] and spell-like effects. Divine spells are drawn from [[Deity|divine forces]] and are considered generally less dramatic and destructive than arcane spells, with a greater focus on [[Magic/Conjuration|healing]] and protection and significant variance based on the [[Domain|domains]] of the deity granting them.



## Nature of divine magic

> The power of the divine is steeped in faith, the unseen, and belief in a power source from beyond the [[Material Plane]].
> Little is known about the source of divine magic, how deities gain the ability to grant spells to their followers, or how deities can influence far-flung [[Plane|planes]] and creatures.


## On Golarion

> Divine magic is one of the two most common magical traditions on [[Golarion]], but is seen as more special or important compared to [[Arcane|arcane]]. Even commoners understand that divine magic is a gift from the gods and those who wield it have the potential to make impossible happen. However, this means that most priests, who are only capable of minor spellcasting, if any, are often expected to perform miracles of healing and are blamed when they fail to do so.


## Practitioners

> *Main First Edition articles: [[Cleric]], [[Rules/Classes/Druid]], [[Inquisitor]], [[Oracle]], [[Paladin]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Ranger]]*
*Main Second Edition articles: [[Cleric]], [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Champion]], [[Sorcerer]], [[Oracle]], [[Summoner]], and [[Witch]]*
> Many people gain the ability to cast divine spells through devotion to a deity, including [[Cleric|clerics]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Champion|champions]]. [[Oracle|Oracles]] are often chosen by divine forces to be vessels of their power; [[Witch|witches]] draw their powers from a patron; [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]] can be born with ability to conduct divine magic; and [[Summoner|summoners]] may gain a connection to the divine through their [[Eidolon|eidolon]].
> Clerics and champions are especially tied to their patron deities. Their [[Alignment|alignment]] and actions must closely reflect their deity's faith to avoid drawing their patron's wrath or losing their powers. Clerics can also channel their deity's energy through their bodies and into others'. Every cleric on Golarion must have a patron deity.


## Spells

***Main article: [[Spell]]***
> Most divine spellcasters gain their spells from their divine patron, often preparing them through prayer and meditation. Summoners and sorcerers cast their divine spells spontaneously, through the link to their eidolon (for summoners) or their natural ability to channel divine magic (for sorcerers).


## False divine magic

***Main article: [[False divine magic]]***
> A few deceptive entities use non-divine magic to appear to grant divine magic to their followers. This false divine magic only appears to be granted by a god, but is in fact entirely secular or illusory.
