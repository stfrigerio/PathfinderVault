> **Bloatmages**, also known as **hemotheurges** (or **haemotheurges**) or **bloodcasters**, are [[Arcanist|arcanists]] who cast [[Spell|spells]] strengthened by their own blood. They produce excess blood to be used for power in spells and rituals. This blood pools in the folds of skin as blood vessels burst, giving the hemotheurge a grotesquely overweight look that gives rise to their common name.



## Use of leeches

> Bloatmages use leeches to increase the blood flow in their bodies and clean the blood of toxins left behind from the spells they create. With all of the excess blood flowing through their veins, these mages place their leeches strategically, for they have found the extra blood can cause tantrums of uncontrolled rage where fat limbs and blood magic can be thrown around haphazardly. The leeches serve a higher purpose than managing the demeanor of the bloatmages, though, and if too many of them are removed for an extended period of time, the hemotheurge risks death due to over-saturation of blood within their system or simply bleeding to death.


## Haemotheurgy or blood magic

> The craft of the bloatmages is known as **hemotheurgy** (**haemotheurgy**), or more prosaically as **blood magic**.


## Bloatmages on Golarion

> - While bloatmages can be found throughout [[Golarion]], there is a relatively large population of them in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]]. In [[4707 AR]], [[Pathfinder]] [[Eando Kline]] sought out one such hemotheurge named Neshiel to attain an *[[Ioun stone|ioun stone]]* for use with his *[[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Wayfinder|wayfinder]]*.
> - Another group of hemotheurges lives or did live (their current status is unknown) in the [[Mushfens]] of southern Varisia. It is with this group that the powerful bloatmage Togomor was first initiated.
