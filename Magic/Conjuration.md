> One of the eight [[Schools of magic|schools of magic]] recognized throughout [[Golarion]], **conjuration** focuses on summoning magical effects and creatures. A wizard that specializes in conjuration is called a **conjurer**.



## Subschools

![[Treacherous_teleport.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Sometimes teleportation magic has unexpected consequences (for some).
> Every conjuration spell is classified into one of five subschools.

### Calling

> Calling works similarly to teleportation bringing objects and [[Animal|animals]] from another [[Plane|plane]] to the caster's plane. See [[Summoning]] below.


### Creation

*For other meanings of "**Creation**", please see [[Creation disambiguation]].*
> A creation spell brings into existence a new creature or object, permanently or temporarily.


### Healing

> A healing effect restores a creature's body, sometimes by removing [[Disease|diseases]] or other debilitating and unseen effects.


### Summoning

*For the summoner class, see [[Summoner]].*
> For creatures, most conjuration takes one of two forms: **summoning** and **calling**. Most summoned creatures are drawn to the caster for a fixed period of time and return to their home plane when destroyed in their summoned plane. Most called creatures permanently occupy the plane into which they are conjured, and persist until destroyed.


### Teleportation

> Teleportation effects allow you to instantaneously move from one point in space to another. Teleportation is different from normal movement.


## Focused arcane schools

> Schools of magic may be further specialized by some wizards who adopt focused arcane schools and those associated with the school of conjuration are shown below.

### Creation


### Extradimension

> Conjurers can further specialize in creating [[Extradimensional|extradimensional]] spaces and [[Demiplane|demiplanes]], which are often valuable talents for smugglers.


### Teleportation

![[Conjurer.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A conjurer.
> At the [[Acadamae]], [[Korvosa]]'s premier magical institute for the instruction of specialist wizards, conjuration is favored over the other eight schools of study and is a required component of every student's final examinations. An important benchmark for all students at the Acadamae is the summoning of an [[Imp|imp]] whether they are conjurers or not. Many of these imps are released into the area surrounding the school and each year an aerial battle erupts between the imps and Korvosa's native population of [[Pseudodragon|pseudodragons]].
> Conjurers, especially if they are also [[Diabolist|diabolists]], find considerable favor in [[Cheliax]]. Living in a country where the state religion is the worship of [[Asmodeus]], Cheliax's citizens tend to respect all arcane spellcasters due to their assumed connections to [[Hell]].
> Other groups known to deal with conjuration include the opposing [[Blackfire Adepts]] and [[Riftwardens]], the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] [[Bloodstone Conservatory]], [[Genie binder|genie binders]], [[Hellknights]], [[Nidal|Nidalese]] [[Shadowcallers|shadowcallers]], and [[Osirion|Osirian]] mages.


### Sin magic

***Main article: [[Sin magic]]***
> During the reign of the [[Runelords|runelords]] of ancient [[Thassilon]], conjuration was associated with the sin of sloth, and was therefore the specialty of the ruler of the realm of [[Cyrusian]].
