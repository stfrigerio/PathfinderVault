 A source of rare cantrips.
> A **cantrip** is the name given to any [[Spell|spell]] of the lowest level that an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] caster, such as [[Wizard|wizard]] or [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]], might cast. The [[Magic|magic]] associated with a cantrip is so inconsequential that a [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]] might cast it without limit. Nevertheless, wizards must still write cantrips in [[Spellbook|spellbooks]] in order to memorize it for casting.


## Rare cantrips

> Some cantrips are classified as **rare cantrips** and [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] that usually gain access to all cantrips do not automatically gain access to such spells when they start their arcane careers. A spellcaster gains access to rare cantrips only by uncovering their secrets in some other way. Some are guarded by jealous [[Mage|mages]], while others are lost in missing libraries or moulder on forgotten [[World/Scroll|scrolls]].
