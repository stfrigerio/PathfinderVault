> The term **extradimensional** describes a [[Metaphysical|metaphysical]] existence outside of any [[Plane|plane]] or [[Dimension|dimension]]. (The term **nondimensional** is synonymous.) For example, a *[[Bag of holding|bag of holding]]* stores objects in a tiny extradimensional space that does not exist as part of any other dimension, including the dimension on which the container itself exists.



## Extradimensional interactions

*For a list of [[Magic|magic]] related to extradimensionality, see [[CategoryExtradimensional magic|Extradimensional magic]].*
> Extradimensional spaces can serve many functions, and are most often created as a result of [[Magic|magic]], particularly [[Spell|spells]] and [[Magic item|magic items]].
> Extradimensional spaces are often useful for moving cumbersome or dangerous objects, as their weight does not increase with their contents and are sealed environments not prone to outside contamination when closed. Likewise, extradimensional shelters can protect creatures inside them from the elements, though some rely on circulating air from outside.
> An entrance to extradimensional spaces created by certain spells, such as *mage's magnificent mansion* or *[[Rope trick|rope trick]]*, do not move with [[Ship|ships]].


### Reactions between extradimensional objects

> Extradimensional spaces can be subject to unusual reactions when combined. For instance, placing an extradimensional container into the extradimensional space of a *[[Rope trick|rope trick]]*. Doing so prevents access to the container's extradimensional space until the container is removed from the space. Another example involves direct interactions between a *bag of holding* and a *portable hole*, which can destroy or exile both objects and create a [[Planar rift|planar rift]] or [[Portal|portal]] to the [[Astral Plane]].


## Creatures

> Some creatures exist in, create, or can detect extradimensional spaces.

> - Soulsliver: Lives in extradimensional gaps behind mirrors.
> - Taotieh: Contains an extradimensional core that allows it to swallow creatures larger than itself.
