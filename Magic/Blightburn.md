 Blightburn.
> Beyond the dangerous beasts and [[Evil|evil]] inhabitants of the [[Darklands]], additional environmental hazards exist. The [[Radioactive|radioactive]] **blightburn** crystals are one such hazard. The incandescent green mineral emits harsh [[Radiation|radiation]] which not only dimly illuminates the area around it, but also causes serious harm to anyone in its proximity.
> Those who touch the stones are instantly burned and blistered by the intense radiological aura, and anyone within 60 feet of the stones is susceptible to a potent [[Disease|disease]], also called [[Blightburn disease|blightburn]], which causes increasing frailty, skin sores, hair loss, and brittle bones.


## Magical side effect

> Blightburn also affects [[Magic/Conjuration|teleport]] spells. Only powerful [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] are able to use teleportation to travel to or from an area in the proximity of blightburn, and even they cannot always do so reliably.


## In Golarion

> The vault of [[Orv]] known as the [[Black Desert]] has large concentrations of blightburn in its ceiling, making the cavern [[Poison|poisonous]] to most forms of life.
> Blightburn is also a concern for travellers to the middle layer of the Darklands, [[Sekamina]].
