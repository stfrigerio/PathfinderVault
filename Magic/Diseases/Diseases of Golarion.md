 Artist's interpretation of death.
*This page does not cover hazards or poisons. See [[Hazards of Golarion]] and [[Poisons of Golarion]].*
> Diseases are a common feature of everyday life on [[Golarion]]. They range from innocuous colds and fevers to virulent outbreaks that can kill in a single day. Diseases are most common in poor areas with high population densities, where lack of good sanitation, poor ventilation, bad nutrition, and access to effective healing are endemic.



## Infestations

> An **infestation** is a type of disease caused by parasites, rather than the usual forms of disease, and they require special means to cure and may be contracted by those normally immune to disease, including [[Android|androids]], for instance. [[Undead]] creatures, and other non-living creatures, are immune to parasites. Normal [[Magic|magical]] means of curing diseases are still effective against parasites. Specific infestations may be found in the list below.


## Gods and disease

> The goddess [[Urgathoa]] and the [[Demigod|demigod]] [[Ghlaunder]] are the patron deities of infection and disease. Ghlaunder's deranged followers in particular feel it is their holy duty to spread sickness wherever they go.


## Creatures and disease

![[Leukodaemon.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A leukodaemon.
> Certain creatures spread disease, sometimes through their bite, such as a rabid dog. Alternatively, some creatures are associated with disease, such as [[Leukodaemon|leukodaemons]], the [[Deacon|deacons]] of the [[Horseman of Pestilence]]. Furthermore, some creatures, such as a [[Carrion golem|carrion golem]] are created to spread disease. In this article, creatures are listed under the diseases with which they are associated.


## List of diseases

![[Plague_in_Korvosa.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A plague overwhelms the city of [[Korvosa]].
> Below is a list of some of the diseases that can be found throughout the world. Some are found on every continent, while others are highly localized. It is by no means an exhaustive list.


### Aklo submission

> This disease is just one of those spread via the blood of  an [[Ugothokra|ugothokra]], an artificial [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aberration|aberration]] created in the laboratories of the [[Dominion of the Black]] to spread contagion. Specifically, Aklo submission attacks the brain making the victim particularly suggestive to commands barked in the [[Aklo]] language.


### Anthrakitis

> This deadly disease is most-commonly transmitted via the decaying bodies of infected animals. As they decay, particles of the disease permeate the ground and can lay dormant for decades or perhaps even centuries. Other creatures become infected when they breathe in these particles, or eat plants grown in the soil. The disease can also be passed on through direct contact with an infected person or animal.
Symptoms, which include fatigue, nausea, skin ulcers, and difficulty breathing, generally appear within one to six days. Upon onset of symptoms, anthrakitis can kill an average human in under three days.


### Anxiety spores

> Anxiety spores are carried and transmitted by the claws of the [[Fear eater|fear eater]], an [[Evil|evil]] [[Fey|fey]] creature. The disease targets the victim's emotions causing nervousness and visible muscle spasms.


### Blackscour taint

> *Full article: [[Blackscour taint]]*
Blackscour taint is a fungal disease contracted by ingesting any part of a [[Blackscour|blackscour]] mushroom, or by drinking water that these mushrooms were growing in. 


### Bleak Breath

> This terrible disease broke out in the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] city of [[Kavapesta]] in [[4249 AR]], killing hundreds. The city's citizens refused to flee, seeing the illness as a test by the goddess [[Pharasma]].


### Blightburn or Blightburn Sickness

> *Full article: [[Blightburn]]*
This deadly disease, sometimes termed blightburn sickness, is caused by exposure to a rare, [[Radioactive|radioactive]] mineral found in the [[Darklands]], also called [[Blightburn|blightburn]]. It causes increasing frailty, skin sores, hair loss, and brittle bones, and can quickly lead to a disfiguring death.


### Blinding sickness

> Blinding sickness is a debilitating disease that, while not fatal, can lead to permanent blindness in the victim. It is generally transmitted orally through ingestion of filthy water, or by being injured by infected creatures, such as giant vultures. It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].

![[Plague_Doctor.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A Plague Doctor, part of the official response to the blood veil.

### Blood veil

> Blood veil is a deadly engineered disease created by priests of Urgathoa working in collaboration with [[Red Mantis]] agents. It was manufactured at the behest of [[Ileosa Arabasti|Queen Ileosa Arabasti]] of [[Korvosa]], who wanted to use a major outbreak of the disease to bring the city under her complete control. It is a less deadly, but more virulent form of [[Vorels phage]], and was engineered from that malady. It is characterized at first by headaches, fatigue, coughing, and a characteristic red rash which spreads over the infected person's face. As the illness worsens, the rash develops into pox-like blisters which spread from the face to the neck and limbs, the cough worsens considerably, and lymph glands swell into painful buboes. In the final stages of blood veil, the blisters grow to the size of grapes, black patches are visible under the skin due to internal bleeding, and the victim coughs up blood. If left untreated, blood veil can kill the average human in about a week.


### Bloodfire fever

> Bloodfire fever is carried exclusively by the [[Trollhound|trollhounds]] of eastern [[Avistan]] and [[Iobaria]], and passed on through their bite. The trollhounds themselves serve only as hosts and do not display symptoms. Those who are bitten begin feeling weak within a day, followed by severe internal pain as if the victim's blood were on fire. Additional symptoms include loss of muscular coordination and and severe weakness. Bloodfire fever is generally not fatal.


### Bluespit

> Originating from the [[Silver Mount]] in [[Numeria]], bluespit is a bacterial infection that is contracted if a person inhales a blue-tinged spittle coughed up by a previously afflicted creature. Birds and mammals are carriers of this disease. Initially a victim is fatigued and if they fall unconscious due to this fatigue, they start to suffocate until death releases them.


### Bogwid fever

> Bogwid fever is spread through the bite of a [[Bogwid]], a swamp-dwelling [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aberration|aberration]].


### Bonechill

> Bonechill may be contracted through injuries sustained through exposure to cold weather.


### Bonecrusher (dengue) fever

> Bonecrusher fever, also known as dengue fever, is a debilitating, but generally not fatal disease common in  Golarion's tropical climates. Carried by mosquitoes, it gets its descriptive name from sick person's sensation of having his of her bones crushed from within. Those infected most often have high fevers, terrible headaches, and a distinctive rash that appears as red dots. It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


### Boot soup

> Boot soup is a fungal infection of the foot. The fungus is reddish-brown in colour, and grows painlessly over the foot over approximately 24 hours. Ideally, it should be removed within this time, as afterwards the fungus starts to feed on living tissue, reducing movement and ultimately leading to paralysis. It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


### Brainworms

> Brainworms are not a disease, but tiny parasites. They are passed on via contact with an infected host. They infest the brain, and cause erratic behaviour and in extreme cases serious brain damage. It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


### Bubonic plague

> This deadly disease is also known as **Daemon's Touch** or the **Black Death**, and can kill the average adult in under a week after first exposure. It causes weakness, severe inflammation of the glands, nausea, fever, headaches, and the swelling of the lymph nodes. In the later stages of the disease, bleeding under the skin is common, which often takes on a black pallor. Generally carried by infected vermin or parasites, such as tick swarms, it is also known to be carried by such monstrosities as the undead [[Vrykolakas|vrykolakas]] and [[Drekavac|drekavac]], [[Shaghal|shaghals]], and the [[Div|div]] [[Pairaka|pairaka]]. It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].
> Bubonic plague may also be contracted by creatures without a lymphatic system; for example, infected [[Roper|ropers]] exhibit symptoms including crumbly lumps on their skin and a distracting euphoria, without actually being harmed by the disease. Unfortunately, for others, the roper's lumps still contain highly contagious plague if burst.


### Cackle fever

> This contagious disease affects the mind and causes the victim to laugh uncontrollably. Although it isn't fatal, it can render the average human unconscious in under four days. It is one of the diseases spread by the avatar of disease, the [[Leukodaemon|leukodaemon]], and is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


### Cacodaemonia

> Cacodaemonia is spread by the bite of a [[Cacodaemon|cacodaemon]] and causes the mind to weaken and allows telepathic communication between the infecting cacodaemon and the infected.


### Chillbane Fever and Chillbane Shakes

***Main article: [[Chillbane fever]]***
> [[Chillbane fever|Chillbane Fever]] is an [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] disease, endemic to that wintry country. Chillbane Shakes is a weaker variant of the fever. Both cause fatigue and sickness. As well as a weaker variant, there is a more powerful variant of this disease: virulent chillbane fever.


### Choking Death

***Main article: [[Choking Death]]***
> The **Choking Death** is a terrible respiratory disease that spread westward from Iobaria in [[Casmaron]] throughout most of Avistan in [['42 AR]].


### Cholera

> Cholera is a dangerous disease which causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, and if left untreated, can kill the average human in about a week. The only creature known to carry it is the [[Carrion golem|carrion golem]].


### Coward's Mark

> Coward's Mark is a fungal infection contracted through inhalation of fruiting bodies or contact with an afflicted person. Symptoms include ringworm-like round marks on the skin and a fear of other people, hence the disease's name, but the disease actually attacks the nervous system. Victims' corpses are covered in thousands of fruiting bodies within hours or days of death that are carried by the wind to further spread the disease.


### Creeping Senility

> Creeping senility is a disease and a curse that attacks the mind over several days unless cured.


### Crypt Fever

> Crypt fever is particularly nasty since, like [[Mummy rot|mummy rot]], it is both a disease and a curse: the curse must be removed before effectual healing may be applied to the victim. This supernatural disease can be contracted through contact with a contagious entity or by inhaling. The disease wearies the victim: sapping their strength, confidence and self worth; victims are physically marked by the disease too.


### Daemonic wasting

> Daemonic wasting is spread by the bite of a [[Meladaemon|meladaemon]] and causes the body to weaken.


### Demon fever

> Despite its name, demon fever is actually a deadly disease carried by [[Night hag|night hags]] and not [[Demon|demons]]. It is passed on through a hag's bite and has absolutely no incubation time; effects occur immediately. Multiple strains of the disease exist, some of which can only be cured by magical means. If left untreated, it can kill an average human in under four days. It is also known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


### Demonplague

> The demonplague, sometimes demon plague, is a terrible affliction spreading through water in the [[Worldwound]] that both kills [[Animal|animals]] and corrupts [[Plant|plants]]. The disease brings on madness—paranoia and hallucinations—then decay and rot, including loss of limbs, and then, finally, death. Unintelligent creatures afflicted by the disease rise soon thereafter as [[Undead|undead]] creatures called [[Plagued beast|plagued beasts]]; plagued beasts are also carriers of the disease, passing it on to anyone they contact. Outside the Worldwound, the disease seems much less virulent proving its [[Abyss|Abyssal]] heritage.


### Devil Chills

> This disease is carried by various [[Devil|devils]], including [[Accuser devil|accuser devils]], [[Edavagor|edavagors]] [[Barbazu|barbazus]], and [[Pit fiend|pit fiends]], passed on through contact with the devils' natural attacks. It is also carried by pit hags. It generally causes the infected person to become quite weak within a few days. Although it is a quite virulent disease, it is not life-threatening. It is also known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


### Dissolution

> Dissolution is the curse of a wasting disease.


### Dominion plague

> This bizarre disease is associated with the [[Dominion of the Black]] and causes afflicted creatures' bodies to suck in nearby light and shed darkness; creatures entering this darkness are exposed to the plague.


### Dvezda plague

> Amongst the numerous plagues that have beset [[Iobaria]] over the centuries, the Dvezda plague is named after the [[Dvezda]] [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] who were practically made extinct by this particular plague. Modern centaurs living in the [[Dvezda Marches]] seem to have adopted resistance to the disease, but the contagion still lives on. The plague is a virus that causes severe fever and sweating after a few days incubation, followed by tremors. The blood is then thinned, leading to bleeding from various orifices. Ultimately, death follows.


### Drakeplague

> **Drakeplague** was a sickness originating from [[Iobaria]] that spread in [[4519 AR]] and had a terrible impact on the draconic population, killing 60% of the [[Dragon|dragons]] of that land. The disease was apparently ended due to the sacrifice of the [[Silver dragon|silver dragon]], Cithaythren. The last survivor from the Drakeplague is the [[White dragon|white dragon]], [[Sjohvornor]], still widely feared in Iobaria.

### Dysentery

> Dysentery is the term given for a broad range of intestinal afflictions. It causes explosive diarrhoea. This can lead to dehydration, weakness and even death. It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


### Eidite sickness

> Eidite sickness is spread via contact with the toxic mineral called eidite found in the [[Karggat Hills]] near [[Alkenstar]]. The mineral may well be another foul relic of the ancient war between [[Geb's Rest]] and [[Nex]]. The disease attacks the brain and makes the body more susceptible to other diseases and [[Poisons of Golarion|poisons]]. A particularly unusual element of this disease is the fact that [[Construct|constructs]] are *not* immune to it: constructs are normally immune to all disease. Constructs contracting the disease go berserk attacking any living creatures.


### Enteric fever

> Also known as typhoid fever in cooler climes, this disease is spread by contaminated food, often the result of ingesting raw or undercooked meat. Within a few days of infection, the victim develops severe nausea, high fever and sweating, exhaustion, and abdominal pain. Later, rose-colored spots appear on the chest and abdomen, and the infected person often suffers from dehydration and the shakes. If left untreated, enteric fever can kill in under five days.


### Ergia

> Ergia may be contracted through exposure to the strange blue energy emanating from the [[Nameless Spire]] at the North Pole of Golarion. The disease transforms the victims' organs into a liquid blue energy and prevents the raising from the dead of any victim dying of this affliction. Those in the process of dying of this disease glow blue as if a *[[Faerie fire|faerie fire]]* spell had been cast upon them.


### Fevered Dreams

> Fevered dreams is a curse that brings on nightmares and consequently fatigue.


### Filth fever

> This disease is passed on via the bite of infected animals, particularly those that frequent sewers, such as rats and [[Otyugh|otyughs]] or [[Giant fly|giant flies]]; or feed on carrion, such as a giant vulture. It is also known that the [[Undead|undead]] can spread the disease, for instance, [[Huecuva|huecuva]] and [[Penanggalen|penanggalen]]. Symptoms appear within 1–3 days and include general fatigue and muscle and joint aches. If left untreated it can kill the average human in under a week. It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


### Final rest

> Final rest is an alien disease hailing from the crashed [[Spaceship|spaceship]] in Numeria that kills by sucking emotion out of its victims. It is caught via inhalation.


### Firegut

> A less severe version of dysentery, firegut causes vomiting. It can be hard to recover from. It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


### Flesh Ripen Fever

> This disease is just one of those spread via the blood of  an ugothokra, an artificial aberration created in the laboratories of the Dominion of the Black to spread contagion. Specifically, flesh ripen fever attacks the body of the victim decaying their flesh so that it emits a nauseating stench, sickening the victim and those nearby.


### Fogshroud miasma

> Fogshroud miasma is a disease that affects anyone inhaling from a disease-laden ground-lying cloud found in some swamps and marshes.


### Fractal Etch [Infestation]

> Fractal etch is an infestation caused by harmful [[Nanite|nanites]]. The name derives from the symptom of circuit-like etching across the victim's scalp but, within the brain, nanites are attacking memory and experience. Contact or inhalation are the ways this infestation is spread; electricity may be effective in destroying the nanites and thus curing the disease. It has been observed that victims dying of this infestation may not be raised as undead creatures.


### Fungal rot

> Fungal rot is a disease carried by the creature known as the [[Slime mold|slime mold]], which passes it on through contact with its outer membrane. The infected person becomes fatigued in its early stages. Eventually paralysis sets in and the skin takes on a black hue before breaking down and running from the body like a liquid. Death generally occurs in seven to ten days if left untreated.


### Galtan pox

*See [[Syphilis|syphilis]], below.*

### Ghoul fever 

> Ghoul fever is a supernatural disease carried by undead [[Ghoul|ghouls]], [[Ghoulghast|ghasts]], and [[Ghoullacedon|lacedons]]. It is transmitted through the creature's bite, and becomes full-blown within a single day. This debilitating disease, if untreated, will kill the average human in under a week. Those killed by ghoul fever will rise from the dead the following midnight as either a ghoul, ghast, or lacedon. Eating ghoul flesh can also cause ghoul fever.  [[Skaveling|Skavelings]], sometimes called ghoul bats, also carry ghoul fever in their bite.


### Glacier plague

> Glacier plague is found in areas of supernatural cold and so is common in ruins and forests of Irrisen. The disease freezes an afflicted person from within causing initial feelings of tiredness and fatigue and then slowness, akin to petrification: speech is lost and movement is severely hampered and slowed until it is lost completely. The disease itself is not fatal but any victim caught outside and frozen is very likely to subsequently die from exposure.


### Gout

> The gout is a painful inflammation of the joints, most commonly the joint at the base of the big toe. It is caused by the excessive consumption of meat or beer, or simply by being overweight. As such, it is most often an affliction of the wealthy.


### Grey/Gray pox

> Grey pox is carried and spread by the spittle of [[Schir|schir]] [[Demon|demons]]. As they constantly gnaw their halberds, the disease is also spread through injuries from any schir's weapon. The disease weakens the victim eventually causing catatonia; it is accompanied by grey splotches on the skin, which give rise to the name of this disease.


### Green haze

> Green haze is a mould infection of the eyes. If untreated, it can cause permanent blindness. It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


### Greenscale

> This disease causes patches of skin to crack and weep an extremely unpleasant green pus. It is normally contracted through injury, but some carrion-eating birds may become carriers of it. It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


### Hag pox or Hag's pox

*See [[Syphilis|syphilis]], below.*

### Half-Life Palsy

> This disease is also a curse. Interestingly, this disease has extra potency against undead who feed off afflicted victims.


### Harlot's curse

*See [[Syphilis|syphilis]], below.*

### Howl of the North

> A madness brought on by the disorientation caused by the long polar nights, Howl of the North inflicts the victim with a primal fear of animals. Natives of the polar region seem immune to this insanity.


### Implant Rejection Syndrome

> This disease is just one of those spread via the blood of  an ugothokra, an artificial aberration created in the laboratories of the Dominion of the Black to spread contagion. Specifically, implant rejection syndrome attacks both mind and body of its victims, but is particularly aggressive against cybernetically-enhanced creatures as it can disable cybernetic implants.


### Insanity

> There are many afflictions that can affect the mind brought on by extreme suffering in mind, body or spirit or through witnessing events of an horrific, alien or maddening form. In extreme cases, the afflicted goes insane. Insanity may also be inflicted on a victim using [[Magic|magic]] via a spell or a [[Curses of Golarion|curse]]. Insanity may be cured by magic or by natural, albeit long, methods. Some types of insanity known are:

> - Amnesia
> - Mania
> - Multiple Personality Disorder
> - Paranoia
> - Phobia
> - Psychosis
> - Schizophrenia

### Leprosy

> Leprosy is a disfiguring disease that can be contracted through simple skin contact with an infected person. If not treated immediately, it becomes much more difficult to cure. The victim develops skin lesions, severe nasal congestion, and has a hard time healing most wounds. It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] and [[Qadira]], although it can also be found in other parts of [[Golarion]] as well.


#### Ash Leprosy

> [[Ash giant|Ash giants]] carry a type of contagious leprosy called ash leprosy.


#### Scarlet Leprosy

> A much more virulent and deadly form of leprosy exists called scarlet leprosy, which is a highly virulent and fatal form of the disease. It causes similar symptoms to leprosy, but is much harder to cure and, if left untreated, can kill a human in under three days. It is normally carried by [[Carrion golem|carrion golems]] and can arise in places where biological waste is poorly handled. The sub-continent of [[Vudra]] is known to suffer outbreaks of scarlet leprosy on occasion.


### Lycanthropy

***Main article: [[Lycanthrope]]***
> Lycanthropy is a supernatural curse which resembles a disease. It can be contracted by being bitten by a lycanthrope such as a [[Werewolf|werewolf]] or [[Wererat|wererat]]. The affliction remains dormant until the next full moon, whereupon the victim undergoes an involuntary transformation into an animal and becomes filled with an uncontrollable rage and blood lust. The victim generally retains no memory of any events experienced while transformed, and returns to his or her normal form upon sunrise. Although the affliction can be cured by a powerful [[Cleric|cleric]], drinking a preparation made of [[Wolfsbane|wolfsbane]] can help the victim overcome it as well.
> Lycanthropy can also be passed on from a mother to her offspring. Children born with lycanthropy are known as natural lycanthropes, and it is only they who can pass on the affliction through their bite. Natural lycanthropes have greater control over their transformation, and do not suffer from loss of memory. A person suffering from lycanthropy who contracted it through a bite is known as an afflicted lycanthrope. Although it is a rare occurrence, a person can become a [[Werebear|werebear]] by drawing the "Bear" card from a Harrow deck of many things.
> Some believe that it was the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Jezelda]] who first brought lycanthropy to Golarion, although her faithful dispute this claim. Lycanthropy is known to be particularly common among the [[Ulfen]] of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] (where it is considered a sign of favor given by nature spirits), in the small [[Varisia|Varisian]] village of [[Wolf's Ear|Wolfs Ear]], and in [[Darkmoon Vale]] in northeastern [[Andoran]].


### Malaria

> Malaria, sometimes called jungle fever, is transmitted by mosquito bites. It causes fever and convulsions. It can sometimes lead to brain damage, especially in children. It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


### Mana Fever

> Mana fever is a magical disease spread by [[Mana Wastes mutant|Mana Wastes mutants]] which affects both mind and body. Immunity to the disease is gained after a week's suffering but at the terrible cost of becoming a Mana Waste mutant.


### Mark of the Prophet

> Mark of the Prophet, or Moaning Tears, is a virulent disease spread by the wearer of the [[Apollyon Ring]].



*This section is a [[PathfinderWikiStub|stub]]. You can help us by [[httpspathfinderwikicomwindexphptitleDiseases of Golarionactionedit|expanding it]].*


### Mindfire

> Mindfire attacks the brain, causing severe pain, but is not ultimately fatal. It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


### Moaning Tears

*See [[Mark of the Prophet]], above.*

### Mortasheen

> The disease mortasheen is known to be carried and transmitted only by the aquatic [[Fey|fey]] called the [[Nuckelavee|nuckelavee]]. Avengers of wrongs done to nature, they pass on the disease via their claws, or else through the horrific blight they can project from their bodies. Unlike most diseases, mortasheen begins affecting the infected person immediately after exposure. The victim becomes listless and tired and can die in under four days if not cured. Once a person becomes infected, he or she also becomes a carrier, albeit of a less-virulent form of mortasheen.


### Moxix's Delectation

> Moxix's Delectation is a disease specific to the unique [[Demon|demon]] called [[Moxix]], the Drinker of Human Hopes, who is bound to the [[Shackles]] island of [[Yoha's Graveyard|Yohas Graveyard]]. The disease is spread by the demon's breath weapon and is incredibly virulent and attacks both mind and body. Furthermore, sufferers of the disease feel a compulsion to eat the flesh of [[Humanoid|humanoids]] and any sufferer who dies of the disease shortly thereafter rises as a [[Ghast|ghast]].


### Mummy rot

> This supernatural affliction is both a disease and a curse. It is passed on via direct contact with many types of [[Undead|undead]] [[Mummy|mummies]]. Symptoms appear within one minute. It can only be cured if the curse is lifted first via [[Magic|magic]]. In addition, those infected are highly resistant to any form of [[Magic/Conjuration|healing magic]] until the curse is lifted. It quickly weakens and severely disfigures the infected person and can kill an average [[Human|human]] in under four days. Those who perish from the disease crumble to dust and cannot be resurrected by normal means.
> Variants of mummy rot are known to exist, including:

> - Corpse chills
> - Grave ichor
> - Phantom infestation
> - Swamp crumble

### Necrotic boils

> This deadly disease is thought only to be carried by the undead creatures known as [[Festrog|festrogs]]. The creature is covered in sickening boils, which when ruptured can pass the disease through contact with the skin. Symptoms include high fever and the growth of painful, puss-filled boils which cover the body. If untreated, necrotic boils can kill the average human in about four days.


### Night Plague

***Main article: [[Night Plague]]***
> Night Plague was a terrible disease that was used by the [[Usij]], [[Necromancy|necromantic]] followers of the [[Osirion|Osirian]] [[Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues]] in [[-3064 AR]] to wreak havoc among the royal houses of [[Jistka Imperium]].


### Parasitic Soul

> Parasitic soul is a curse and a disease acquired through opening a *[[Phylactery of the failed|phylactery of the failed]]*. Succumbing to the curse/disease means the soul of the failed [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|lich]] contained in the *phylactery* begins to take over the cursed person's body, ultimately using the body to achieve the goal of lichdom.


### Phycomid spores

> A very fast-acting disease caused by the spores of the [[Phycomid|phycomid]] entering a creature by ingestion or injury. Dying of this disease spawns a new phycomid in the body of the deceased.


### Pulsing puffs

> Pulsing puffs is the name given to a fungus infestation of untreated wounds. Small blue spores start to grow within the wound, and grow into beautiful phosphorescent mounds that pulse in time to the victim's heartbeat. They prevent the wound from healing naturally, and in time reduces the victim's dexterity. It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. Furthermore, pulsing puffs is the disease most commonly spread by the [[Fey|fey]] creatures called [[Polevik|poleviks]]. They throw puffball fungi, which contain the disease, at enemies; these symbiotic fungi are grown on the polevik's body.


### Purple Pox

> Myceloids spread purple pox via their spores and anyone breathing them in or exposing an injury to them may acquire the disease. The onset of the disease is rapid and the body of anyone dying of purple pox bloats and bursts a day later releasing a new myceloid. Some creatures affected by the disease yet not fatally, nevertheless can gain a compunction to offer their bodies to the myceloids for sacrifice.


### Rabies

> This potentially lethal and common disease is passed on through the saliva of infected animals. Dogs are the most common carriers. Generally transmitted through open wounds, it has a slow onset, but if left untreated, can kill an average human in a little over a week.


### Rapture pox

> Rapture pox is a disease known to be carried by the construct known as a carrion golem. If left untreated, it leads to an outbreak of disfiguring boils over much of the body, severe nausea, followed by apathy and listlessness.


### Red ache

> It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. In more temperate forests, red ache is carried by giant ticks.


### Red ague

> Red ague is a temporary ailment brought on by consuming a plant found in the Mwangi Expanse known as scarlet vetch. It causes extreme irritability and combativeness in addition to high fever. In extreme cases, the person suffering from red ague goes into a mindless frenzy in which he or she attacks anyone in sight.


### Red drip

> The fungus infection known as red drip leads to the swelling of the hand. The nails bleed and eventually drop off, and the hand becomes covered in weeping sores. The infection then spreads to the rest of the body, leading to death. It is known to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] and is creeping across western [[Isger]] thanks to the [[Wight Mother of Isger]].


### Scales

> The Scales is so rife in one of the districts of [[Ilvarandin]] that the district is actually named after it. It causes dry, flaky skin which reduces physical flexibility and self-confidence. It is particularly virulent when infecting reptilian creatures.


### Scarlet leprosy

*See [[Leprosy]], above.*

### Scurvy

> [[httpenwikipediaorgScurvy|Scurvy]] is the bane of seafaring folk but can be kept at bay by imbibing fruit juices.


### Sewer madness

> This nasty disease is spread by exceptionally diseased otyughs known as [[OtyughPlaguebearer|plaguebearers]]. It is a virulent infection which attacks the health and agility of the victim, and also saps their judgement and willpower. 


### Shadow Blight

> Shadow blight is a supernatural strength-sapping disease spread by [[World/Items & Equipment/Runes/Shadow|plague shadows]]: shadows of disease-bearing animals. Being a supernatural disease, it requires magic to remove a curse in addition to removing the disease in order to effect a cure. If the disease is not cured, the sufferer will die and rise again as a plague shadow within days.


### Shakes

> The illness known as the shakes is believed to be endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


### Shattermind

> Shattermind refers to a group of insanity-causing diseases that are spread by skin contact amongst predominantly [[Humanoid|humanoids]] and [[Monstrous humanoid|monstrous humanoids]].


### Sikari rage

> The disease known as Sikari rage is carried by the Sikari macaque monkeys of [[Vudra]]. The creatures are often aggressive in nature, and pass it on through their bite or scratches. Those affected immediately become incoherent and filled with intense anger, lashing out at those around them without thinking. This condition quickly passes, however, as the disease seems to be unable to live outside of the body of a Sikari macaque. Only humanoids seem susceptible to this ailment, with other animals being strangely immune.


### Sleeping sickness

> This disease, endemic to the Mwangi Expanse and [[Sodden Lands]], is spread by insect bites. It causes fever, joint pain, swelling of the neck and glands, and severe fatigue in its early stages. Later on, it attacks the brain, causing confusion and a lack of coordination. The victim begins to loose track of time, while continuing to suffer from alternating exhaustion and insomnia. Arsenic can sometimes cure it, if the patient survives the effects of the poison.


### Slimy doom

> Little is known of the deadly disease called slimy doom, other than that it is endemic in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. It is known to be carried by such megavectors as the [[Drekavac|drekavac]], [[Ochre jelly|ochre jelly]], [[Meladaemon|meladaemon]], [[Leukodaemon|leukodaemon]], and via the contagion, cursed earth, or epidemic spells.


### Soldier's Peace [Infestation]

> Soldier's peace is usually injected and so is not contagious. The jab consists of nanites that flow to the brain and can, from there, cause sickening pain whenever the subject performs a violent act or has violent thoughts.


### Spores

> Some creatures can spread diseases via spores such as the phycomid (see above) or the [[Cythnigot|cythnigot]] [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]].


### Syphilis

> Syphilis is the [[Elven]] term for a venereal disease, which causes terrible disfiguration and, ultimately, death if not treated. It has many common names including 'hag pox' or 'hag's pox', 'harlot's curse' and 'Galtan pox'.


### Tallowthroat

> Tallowthroat originated in the town of [[Karpad]] in [[Nidal]]. It spreads by physical contact or by consuming tainted water, and symptoms include waxy skin, a swollen throat, and increased irritability. It is apparently connected to the [[Plane of Shadow]]; [[Fetchling|fetchlings]] are immune to the disease, though they might act as carriers. If untreated, within a few days a fatal, gruesome explosion of the swollen neck goiter releases [[World/Items & Equipment/Runes/Shadow|shadow]] creatures in the disease's final stage.


### Tetanus

> Also known as "lockjaw" or "ironjaw", tetanus is a disease generally transmitted by exposing an open wound to contaminated or rusty metal. Symptoms generally present within one to six days and include difficulty swallowing, headaches, fever, and eventually violent muscle spasms. Those infected often complain of severe stiffness in the jaw, which can lead to difficulty eating or speaking. Tetanus is not fatal.


### Thought Crawlers [Infestation]

> Thought crawlers refers to an infestation of the body by a particular parasitic worm that is caused when a wound is exposed to the worms' tiny eggs. The hatched worms move via exposed nerves into the nervous system and then to the spine and the brain and take residence in cerebrospinal fluid. Then the infestation begins to afflict the victim with gradually worsening neurological symptoms, adversely affecting the fighting capability, for instance.


### Tursas

> Tursas is a disease specific to the iku-turso [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aberration|aberration]] and passed on by its bite. The disease is supernatural in nature and, eventually and painfully, transforms the victim into an iku-turso. The aberrations consider the disease to be sacred and the victims thereof blessed.

### Urgathoa's breath

> Urgathoa's breath, also known as tuberculosis, and is disease common to large cities, especially in neighborhoods where sanitation is minimal or non-existent. Symptoms can sometimes take years to present and include a chronic, bloody cough and chest pain. If not treated, the infected person can develop high fever, chills, loss of appetite, night sweats, and fatigue. Priests of Urgathoa are known to have develop a particularly virulent from of this malady, one in which the infected person can develop symptoms in a matter of days. They use it to instil the proper fear of their goddess in the infected.


### Void Death

> This disease is spread by the bite of an [[Akata|akata]]: their mouths hold parasitical, larval young which are transferred to a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] host. Creatures dying of this disease rise as void zombies just hours later.


### Vorel's phage

***Main article: [[Vorel's phage|Vorels phage]]***
> This disease is exceedingly rare and has only been reported in southeastern [[Varisia]]. The onset of symptoms is incredibly quick, generally within a single day, and can include painful and disfiguring facial tumors, and a slow sloughing-off the dermis over the entire body. Eventually fatal of left untreated, the painful disfigurement often makes the victim go insane first.


### Waste trembles

> Waste trembles is a disease affecting the strength and nimbleness of a creature contracting it. It is spread by the bite of a [[Capramace|capramace]]: a wild [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aberration|aberration]] found in the [[Mana Wastes]].

### Wormrot

> Wormrot is carried by benaiohs, the ancient creations of [[Stone giant|stone giant]] followers of [[Fandarra]]. The disease is transmitted when a benaioh sprays slime at its opponents and its onset is almost instantaneous. The disease attacks the body causing sickness followed by potentially fatal weakening. Creatures dying of this disease are, within a day, transformed into benaiohs themselves.


### Yellowtongue sickness

> This disease ravaged the [[Goblin|goblin]] [[Kingdom of Zog]] in [[4217 AR]]. Weakened, it fell to a loose coalition of adventurers, river folk, and half-elves that same year.
