### Chillbane fever epidemic

> In [[4227 AR 1]], miners working in the [[Vault of Silver and Ice]] in the western [[Irrisen]] province of [[Bleakmarch]] contracted a deadly and contagious [[Diseases of Golarion|disease]] they initially called **shivering sickness**, but which eventually became known as **chillbane fever**. Hundreds of mine workers died and although the mine was sealed to contain the infection, the disease spread to the provincial capital of [[Algidheart]], devastating the city. [[Velikas|Queen Velikas]] called on a priestess of [[Desna]], named [[Inkit Reli]], from the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] for aid, and she managed to get it under control. A milder version of the disease survives to this day.


### Chillbane fever

> Today's version of chillbane fever is not to be confused with the far more potent earlier version that swept across Bleakmarch and devastated Algidheart. It is an infectious disease, characterized by the sufferer's constant shaking. One known carrier of the disease is the [[Khala|Khala dragon]].
