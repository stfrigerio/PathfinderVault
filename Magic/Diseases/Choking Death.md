> The **Choking Death** is a terrible respiratory [[Diseases of Golarion|disease]] that spread westward from [[Iobaria]] in [[Casmaron]] throughout most of [[Avistan]] in [['42 AR]]. The disease is said to have killed nearly three-quarters of Iobaria's inhabitants, leaving many of its cities completely abandoned in its wake, and leading to a near total collapse of the nation. Even though it eventually burned itself out, the disease continues to exist in small pockets in Iobaria to the present day, keeping the region's population low.
