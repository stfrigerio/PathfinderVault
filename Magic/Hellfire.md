> The fires of [[Hell]] are a common linguistic and literary image but hardly compare to the malicious and deadly reality of actual **hellfire**. It burns without need of fuel, and can be found easily in water, rock or air.  Unlike common flame, hellfire seems to be driven by a malicious will intent on destruction. Stinking of [[Sulfur|sulfur]], its flame burns with an [[Unholy|unholy]] radiance that disproportionately harms [[Good|good]] and moral creatures. Hellfire is most commonly encountered in the layers of [[Phlegethon]], [[Malebolge]], [[Cocytus]], [[Caina]], and [[Nessus]].
