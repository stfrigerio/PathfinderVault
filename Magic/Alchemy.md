> **Alchemy** is the [[Science|science]] of materials: [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemists]] can use [[Science|scientific]] methods, sometimes combined with [[Magic|magic]], to produce a vast array of alchemical substances with many practical uses.
> Alchemy is not magic. It uses chemicals, minerals, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Plant|plants]], and other substances, collectively referred to as [[Alchemical reagent|alchemical reagents]], to create potent elixirs, alchemical [[Bomb|bombs]], and other concoctions. Purely alchemical items never have magical auras, and they cannot be dismissed or dispelled.

 Some alchemists adopt less rigorous methods.


## Practice of alchemy

> Although many on [[Golarion]] will be familiar with the simple products of alchemy, such as tindertwigs or fireworks, readily found in merchant shops, some alchemists have studied many years to perfect their craft and are able to manipulate matter in many strange ways.
> Alchemy has had a great influence on Golarion. [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Elemental]] weapons like alchemist's fire and alchemical elixirs are widespread and can be used by anyone, and alchemical techniques are often used in other sciences and industries. Alchemy enables creation of stronger materials for [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] and [[Weapon|weapons]], [[World/Items & Equipment/Black powder|black powder]] for [[Firearm|guns]] and [[Explosive|explosives]], and even something as simple as preservatives for volatile substances for safe transportation. Steam engines, while very new to Golarion, also prefer to use alchemically derived heat sources rather than coal furnaces.
> Alchemy can be used by anyone who can find a recipe and alchemical reagents, with no need for specialized training or unique abilities. A single alchemist can greatly improve life for those around him by creating elixirs to cure [[Diseases of Golarion|disease]] and [[Poisons of Golarion|poison]], and restore vitality, or [[Alchemical weapon|alchemical weapons]] to help defend the community from outside threats.
