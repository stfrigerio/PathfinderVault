*For another meaning of "divination", please see divination (spell).*
> **Divination** is one of the eight [[Schools of magic|schools of magic]] practiced on [[Golarion]].  It deals with the uncovering of mysteries, fortune-telling, and the perceiving of places and people at a distance. [[Wizard|Wizards]] who specialize in this form of [[Magic|magic]] are known as **diviners**.



## On Golarion

*See also: [[CategoryDiviners]]*
> Diviners are often found in the company of leaders and the military, as their magics allow them to glean information about enemies and discover the presence of spies, assassins, or plots against them. [[Pharasma]], the [[God|goddess]] of fate and prophecy, is the patron of diviners.
> With the advent of the [[Age of Lost Omens]] over a century ago, the reputation of diviners and soothsayers has been diminished. One of the strongest and most-dearly held prophesies held by [[Human|humans]] of the [[Inner Sea region]] was that the god [[Aroden]] would return in [[4606 AR]] and usher in the [[Age of Glory]]. With his death and the breaking of the prophecy, all such long-term prognostications on Golarion have ceased to come true.
> Divination is the most recently recognized school of magic and did not exist during the reign of the [[Runelords|runelords]] of ancient [[Thassilon]]. It therefore is the only school not associated with a sin in the practice of [[Sin magic|sin magic]].

## Scrying

> **Scrying** is a specialized form of divination magic that creates an invisible sensor that relays information back to the caster about a specific location, object, or person. This sensor generally has the same sensory acuity as the caster. It can be blocked by [[Lead|lead]] sheeting and various forms of defensive magic.
