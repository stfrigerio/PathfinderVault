> **Daivrat** are spellcasters who treat the powerful [[Genie|genie-kind]] as allies rather than as potential sources of power to be enslaved and used, this approach is the opposite of the domineering [[Genie binder|genie binder]]. The daivrat are a uniquely [[Qadira|Qadiran]] approach to the mercurial genies, they posses a great knowledge of the different types of genie, able to recognise the difference between [[Jann|jann]] and half-jann with a mere glance. Every sort of genie recognise the daivrat as allies, and this closeness allows daivrat to [[Magic/Conjuration|summon]] [[Zhyen|zhyen]] as a [[Familiar|familiars]] and gain increased abilities related to one of the four [[Element|elemental]] powers associated with genies.
