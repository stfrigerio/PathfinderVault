> The **arcane tradition**, also known as the **orthodox scheme**, is a mainstream [[Metaphysical|metaphysical]] [[Philosophy|philosophy]] that models the [[Plane|planes]] of the [[Multiverse|multiverse]] as a series of nested spheres.


## Concepts

> The arcane tradition organizes the planes into discrete groups in relation to one another. In the [[Inner Sphere]], the [[Positive Energy Plane|Positive]] and [[Negative Energy Plane|Negative]] [[Energy plane|energy planes]] create and destroy life in opposition to one another, the [[Material Plane]] of our reality spreads across an infinite dimension, the adjacent [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]] provide the fundamental materials of the multiverse, and the [[Ethereal Plane]] permeates the space in between. The [[Astral Plane]] surrounds the Inner Sphere and connects it to the [[Outer Sphere]] planes, the destination of all [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Soul|souls]].
