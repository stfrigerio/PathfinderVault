 A fire elemental: a being of pure elemental energy.
> In much of [[Golarion]], people consider all matter to be composed of four basic **elements**, or forms of **elemental energy**, or **elemental forces**â€”**air**, **earth**, **fire**, and **water**. [[Elemental]] creatures are [[Outsider|outsiders]] that are created from these elements and reside in one of the four [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]] associated with each element:

> - [[Elemental Plane of Air]] has [[Air elemental|air elementals]]
> - [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] has [[Earth elemental|earth elementals]]
> - [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] has [[Fire elemental|fire elementals]]
> - [[Elemental Plane of Water]] has [[Water elemental|water elementals]]
> Elements mix at the borders between Elemental Planes. The [[Secondary element|secondary elements]] formed at these [[Plane|planar]] points of friction can create [[Elemental|elemental]] [[Outsider|outsiders]]. Elemental energy can also be concentrated into [[Planar power component|planar power components]].

### Minkai

> People of [[Minkai]] believe five elements exist: Earth, Fire, [[Void]], Water, and **Wind**. Void energy forms from the friction between Elemental Planes and the [[Negative Energy Plane]], with the Shojinawa manor serving as a focal point of this friction on Golarion.


### Successor States

> People of the [[Successor States]] believe five elements exist: Earth, Fire, **Metal**, Water, and **Wood**. Wood energy forms from the friction between Elemental Planes and the [[First World]].


### Vudra

> People of [[Vudra]] believe five elements exist: Earth, Fire, **Spirit**, Water, and Wind.


## Elemental magic

> Several [[Magic|magic]] users can harness elemental powers, particularly [[Kineticist|kineticists]] and [[Elementalist|elementalists]].


### Elemental augmentations

> An [[Elemental augmentation|elemental augmentation]] is a type of wondrous item which permanently alters a portion of the recipient's body by infusing it with elemental energy. An augmented body part is forever altered; the elemental augmentation remains until the body part is removed, which can have some unfortunate side effects. Elemental augmentations come with some powerful advantages, but also carry some corresponding weaknesses, though these latter tend not to be too debilitating.
