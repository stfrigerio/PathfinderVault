*See also: [[Animal companion|animal companion]], [[Eidolon|eidolon]], and spirit animal*
![[SeoniTattoo.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Seoni]] and Dragon, her blue-tailed skink familiar.
> A **familiar** is an [[Animal|animal]], or some other exotic creature, chosen to aid an arcane spellcaster's study of [[Magic|magic]]. 



## Wizard or arcanist familiars

> A [[Wizard|wizards]] or an [[Arcanist|arcanists]] familiar grants special abilities to its master, but only when the familiar and its master are within one mile of each other. If a familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced one week later through a specialized ritual that takes eight hours to complete.


### Common wizard or arcanist familiars

![[Hawk.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Hawk|Hawks]] are a common choice for a familiar.
> The following familiars are commonly found to be used by wizards, arcanists, [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Adept|adepts]], and some [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]] and [[Witch|witches]] on Golarion.















> - [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Level 1/Bat|bat]]
> - [[Cat|cat]]
> - [[Hawk|hawk]]
> - [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Lizard|lizard]]
> - [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Monkey|monkey]] (also for a sea singer [[Bard's End|bard]])
> - [[Owl|owl]]


> - [[PathfinderWiki/Organizations/Rat|rat]]
> - [[Raven|raven]] (see [[Witch familiars]])
> - [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake viper]] (also for a sorcerer with the serpentine [[Bloodline|bloodline]]).
> - [[Toad|toad]]
> - [[Weasel|weasel]]






### School familiars

> Some specialist wizards may adopt a familiar specific to their chosen [[MagicSchools of Magic|school of magic]]. These **school familiars**, although looking like a normal familiar, gain powers associated with the master's specialist school.


## Witch familiars

![[Feiya.png|right+hmed]] 
 The [[Witch|witch]] [[Feiya]] and her [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fox|fox]] familiar Daji.
![[Scorpion_Companion.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Scorpion|scorpions]] are sometimes adopted as familiars by a number of classes.
> A [[Witch|witch]]'s familiar is slightly different from a [[Wizard|wizard]]'s. By forging strange bonds with unnameable beings, witches gain the service of a mystical adviser, a familiar to both serve her and reveal to her secrets unknown to most mortals. Familiars grant witches bonuses to skills, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual. If a witch's familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced one day later through a special ritual that takes eight hours to complete.


### Common witch familiars

> Witches of [[Irrisen]] are known to favor ravens as familiars.
> The following familiars are most associated with witches, but are also often used by wizards and sorcerers.















> - [[Almiraj|almiraj]]
> - [[Centipede|centipede]]
> - crab
> - [[Giant flea|giant flea]] (only available for witches)


> - [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fox|fox]]
> - [[Octopus|octopus]]
> - [[Scorpion|scorpion]]
> - [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spider]]






### Patron familiars

> **Patron familiars** are witch familiars that are tied to the same patron as their mistress or master and reinforce the connections to the source of the witch's power. almost identical to a normal witch's familiar, patron familiars have certain special abilities that are associated with their patron power.


## Sorcerer familiars

> As well as the choice of a familiar similar to a wizard's, sorcerers may choose to take on a familiar that is more sorcerer related.


### Bloodline familiars

> **Bloodline familiars** are restricted to those spellcasters having an inherent magical capability such as sorcerers, but also [[Bloodrager|bloodragers]], whose magic is associated with the same [[Bloodline|bloodline]] as the familiar. These familiars tend to manifest abilities that resonate with the particular bloodline they share with their master or mistress.


### Sorcerer tattoo familiars

> Some [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]] adopt a tattoo as a familiar. The familiar creature can be carried as a tattoo on the sorcerer's skin or released as a normal familiar.


## Other class familiars

![[Stargazer_of_Pulura.jpg|right+hmed]]

### Alchemists

> Through alchemical discovery, some [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemists]] can create a tumour on their body which acts like a familiar. A **tumour familiar** is detachable and can move independently of the alchemist until such a point that it reattaches back to the alchemist's body. When moving on its own, a tumour familiar takes on the form of a common animal.


### Druids

> A [[Blight druid|blight druid]] may call a familiar in a similar fashion to a wizard, as they cannot call an [[Animal companion|animal companion]].
> Some druids associated with a [[Domain|domain]] may gain a familiar associated with their [[DomainAnimal Domains|animal domain]] instead of attracting an [[Animal companion|animal companion]].
> Other druids attune themselves to bodiless nature spirits and can bring these spirits into being as creatures called [[Leshy|leshies]], that act like familiars.


### Clerics and rangers

> [[Cleric|Clerics]] or [[PathfinderWiki/Ranger|rangers]] of [[Besmara]] may choose a familiar instead of a [[Domain|domain]] or an [[Animal companion|animal companion]], respectively.


### Other classes

> Very rarely members of other classes and [[Prestige class|prestige classes]] may qualify for a familiar such as [[Paladin|paladins]], [[Bard's End|bards]], [[Fighter|fighters]], and [[Stargazer prestige class|stargazers]].


## Uncommon familiars

> The following familiars are either less commonly chosen, or are common only for specific races or in certain locations: It is quite possible that many other animals, similar to those mentioned here, could also be adopted as a familiar.

All such familiars can speak the elemental [[Language|language]] associated with their respective [[Elemental Plane|elemental plane]].

### Other familiars

![[Possessed_Hand.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A spellcaster with a possessed hand familiar.
> Some spellcasters choose their own hand as a familiar after making a mutually acceptable bargain with some form of [[Spirit|spirit]], [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]] or [[Outsider|outsider]] to possess their hand. This form of familiar may aid its "master" in a number of ways, for instance, with extra powers of sight through the hand, with aid to fight with a [[Weapon|weapon]] more effectively, or with ability to act on its own to manipulate objects on behalf of the caster. Perhaps somewhat more horrifically, such a familiar can rip from its master's body and act utterly independently before being reattached to the master's arm.

![[Poppet.png|right+hmed]]

> Some [[Construct|constructs]] can be used as familiars, such as small hand-crafted [[Poppet|poppets]].

> Paizo has published a major work about familiars in its [[Pathfinder Player Companion]] line called *[[Familiar Folio]]*.
