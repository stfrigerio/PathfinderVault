 Arcane magic is often a field of intense study and practice.
> **Arcane magic** is one of three types, or four [[Magical tradition|traditions]], of [[Magic|magic]], along with [[Divine|divine]], [[Occult|occult]]/[[Psychic magic|psychic magic]], and [[Primal magic|primal magic]], that manifests in the form of [[Spell|spells]] and spell-like effects. Arcane spellcasters use logic and rationality to categorize the magic inherent in the world around them. Because of its far-reaching approach, the arcane tradition has the broadest spell list, though it is generally poor at affecting the spirit or the [[Soul|soul]]. Arcane spells are known to create more dramatic and destructive effects.

## On Golarion

> The arcane is the most familiar to many, due to its accessibility to nearly anyone with a rudimentary education, making it among the most prevalent in both day-to-day life and legends. At most, there is an assumption that arcane spellcasters tend to be high-class and pretentious, despite the fact that arcane sorcery is nearly as common as wizardry and is less likely to accompany a formal education.


## Practitioners

> Wizards are the most iconic arcane spellcasters, poring over tomes and grimoires, though arcane sorcerers study the secrets of their blood to unlock the power within themselves.
> [[Magus|Magi]], some [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]], some [[Summoner|summoners]], some [[Witch|witches]], and [[Wizard|wizards]] can all cast arcane spells, as can others who study the arts of spellcraft or have an innate talent for spellcasting.


## Components

> Many arcane magic spells require physical components, almost always in the form of either a reusable [[Focus|focus]] or consumable [[Material component|material component]].


## Written spells

> Arcane spells can be described using an intricate, universal form of notation. Each spell scribe has a unique form that renders written spells incomprehensible to other arcane spellcasters until they decipher its contents. [[Wizard|Wizards]] scribe spells into [[Spellbook|spellbooks]] for reference and preparation, and all arcane spellcasters can read [[Scroll|scrolls]] depicting arcane spells.
