> **Enchantment** is one of the eight [[Schools of magic|schools of magic]] recognized on [[Golarion]]. It deals with influencing the minds of others, either by subtly charming them or through compulsion, which exerts a more overt control over the subject. [[Wizard|Wizards]] who specialize in enchantment [[Magic|magics]] are known as **enchanters**.
> Very perceptive individuals can discern whether someone is under the influence of an enchantment spell. Those targeted by compulsions are generally more obvious in this regard than those affected by a *charm* spell.



## On Golarion

> [[Elf|Elven]] minds seem to be particularly resistant to enchantment magics. The [[Deity|god]] [[Asmodeus]] is associated with enchantments and enchanters of all kinds, and is often worshiped by the less wholesome ones.


### Notable enchanters

*See also: [[CategoryEnchanters]]*
> - [[Sorshen|Runelord Sorshen]]: The [[Runelords|Runelord]] of Lust of the ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian Empire]] was one of the most powerful enchanters the world has ever known. Even though she has been absent for over 10,000 years, her influence can still be felt in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]]. Built on the site of her ancient capital, [[Xin-Eurythnia]], the magical college known as the [[Acadamae]] produces a disproportionately high number of enchantment specialists. In addition, every five to six years, the latent energies inherent in the site will produce an enchanter with powers far beyond his or her experience.

### Sin magic

***Main article: [[Sin magic]]***
> During the reign of the [[Runelords|runelords]] of ancient [[Thassilon]], enchantment was associated with the sin of lust, and was therefore the specialty of [[Sorshen]], ruler of [[Eurythnia]].
