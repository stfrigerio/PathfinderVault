### Adella curse

### Birthing Death

> Found probably only in the [[Valley of the Birthing Death]] in [[Icemark]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], the local [[Varki]] tribes named the curse within the valley as the 'Birthing Death' as it manifests as a rapid rejuvenation of the afflicted taking them back to childhood and oblivion.

### Creeping Senility

> Creeping senility is a disease and a curse that attacks the mind over several days unless cured.


### Crow's curse

> There is a belief in Irrisen that crows are harbingers of death. There is some truth to this fact as some crows carry a malevolent energy due to the supernatural cold of the country. Close proximity to such an infected murder of crows risks falling victim to a terrible curse causing panic and fear in its victims.


### Crypt Fever

> Crypt fever is particularly nasty as, like mummy rot, it is a disease and a curse: the curse must be removed before effectual healing may be applied to the victim. This supernatural disease can be contracted through contact with a contagious entity or by inhaling. The disease wearies the victim: sapping their strength, confidence and self worth; victims are physically marked by the disease too.


### Cursed magic items

***Main article: [[Cursed item]]***
> Cursed [[Magic item|magic items]] can be terrible perversions of beneficial magic items such as a clumsy sword or a strangling necklace. Rarely made by choice, these items are cursed by sloppy workmanship in the creation of a normal magic item.

When an afflicted creature enters a graveyard or other area containing corpses, zombies and skeletons will spontaneously manifest to attack them. THis curse can be undone by returning whatever was stolen.


### Half-Life Palsy

> This disease is also a curse. Interestingly, this disease has extra potency against undead who feed off afflicted victims.


### Kassen's curse

> It is rumoured that the tomb of [[Ekat Kassen]], near the modern day town of [[Kassen]] in [[Nirmathas]], holds a curse for defilers of his final resting place.


### Lycanthropy

*See also: [[Lycanthrope]]*
![[Werewolves.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Werewolves under a full moon.
> Lycanthropy is a supernatural curse which resembles a disease. It can be contracted by being bitten by a lycanthrope such as a [[Werewolf|werewolf]] or [[Wererat|wererat]]. The affliction remains dormant until the next full [[Moon|moon]], whereupon the victim undergoes an involuntary transformation into an [[Animal|animal]] and becomes filled with an uncontrollable rage and blood lust. The victim generally retains no memory of any events experienced while transformed, and returns to his or her normal form upon sunrise. Although the affliction can be cured by a powerful [[Cleric|cleric]], drinking a preparation made of [[Wolfsbane|wolfsbane]] can help the victim overcome it as well.
> Lycanthropy can also be passed on from a mother to her offspring. Children born with lycanthropy are known as natural lycanthropes, and it is only they who can pass on the affliction through their bite. Natural lycanthropes have greater control over their transformation, and do not suffer from loss of memory. A person suffering from lycanthropy who contracted it through a bite is known as an afflicted lycanthrope. Although it is a rare occurrence, a person can become a [[Werebear|werebear]] by drawing the "Bear" card from a *[[Harrow Deck of Many Things]]*.
> Some believe that it was the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Jezelda]] who first brought lycanthropy to Golarion, although her faithful dispute this claim. Lycanthropy is known to be particularly common among the [[Ulfen]] of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] (where it is considered a sign of favour given by nature spirits), in the small [[Varisia|Varisian]] village of [[Wolf's Ear|Wolfs Ear]], and in [[Darkmoon Vale]] in northeastern [[Andoran]].


### Minotaur children

> Most [[Minotaur|minotaurs]] are born to two minotaur parents (as might be expected) but a rare few are born to [[Human|human]] parents as the result of a curse.


### Mummy Rot

> This supernatural affliction is both a disease and a curse. It is passed on via direct contact with an [[Undead|undead]] [[Mummy|mummy]]. Symptoms appear within a single minute. It can only be cured if the curse is lifted first via magic. In addition, those infected are highly resistant to any form of [[Magic/Conjuration|healing magic]] until the curse is lifted. It quickly weakens and severely disfigures the infected person and can kill an average human in under four days. Those who perish from the disease crumble to dust, and cannot be raised from the dead by normal means.


### Oath of the Flesh

> A curse that binds a subject to follow their oath. When the cursed creature makes an oath, they become marked with an ornate symbol carved into their flesh. If they uphold their oaths they suffer no further consequences, but should they break an oath the mark immediately expands into a gaping wound that cannot be healed.


### Oracle's curse

> [[Oracle|Oracles]], the servants of the gods, are always cursed in some way: perhaps by deafness or a rotting away of their body. Despite this curse, the gods' favour is shown in ways which help the oracles overcome their curse in some fashion.


### Parasitic soul

> Parasitic soul is a curse and a disease acquired through opening a *[[Phylactery of the failed|phylactery of the failed]]*. Succumbing to the curse-disease means the soul of the failed [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|lich]] contained in the *phylactery* begins to take over the cursed person's body, ultimately using the body to achieve the goal of lichdom.


### Parched

> Parched causes an extreme thirst in the victim requiring gallons of water to quench or else dehydration sets in.


### Ravenous

> Ravenous causes a debilitating hunger requiring a day's portion of food to be eaten up to every hour to avoid the onset of starvation symptoms.


### Reviled of Nature

> A curse that makes a creature the enemy of nature, driving all animals to attack the cursed creature as soon as they are aware of its presence.


### Reviling Earth

> A curse that falls over entire regions, causing its inhabitants to die more easily.


### Sellsword's Folly

> A curse that robs a creature of its combat prowess, turning even the most hardened veteran into a fumbling and reckless rookie.


### Shadow blight

> Shadow blight is a supernatural strength-sapping disease spread by [[World/Items & Equipment/Runes/Shadow|plague shadows]]: shadows of disease-bearing animals. Being a supernatural disease, it requires magic to remove a curse in addition to removing the disease in order to effect a cure. If the disease is not cured, the sufferer will die and rise again as a plague shadow within days.


### Shattered self

> Shattered self fractures the mind of the victim giving it a second, uncontrolled and particularly nasty personality.


### Slayer's Haunt

> A curse that causes a creature to perceive others as those they have previously killed, still maimed and mangled from their death wounds.


### Spirit Anchor

> A curse that prevents an afflicted creature from moving on to the afterlife should it die.


### Sword of Anathema

> A curse a deity's followers can bestow through divine retribution. When cursed, followers of the deity who bestowed the curse find themselves supernaturally guided in dealing harm to the cursed creature.


### Theft of Thought

> A curse used to protect books that affects a creature who steals it. The cursed creature suffers damage to its memories and finds its skills impaired.


### Thief's Retribution

> A curse that punishes thieves. If a cursed creature steals something, they soon find themselves loosing something of equal or greater value, though the value may not be monetary. If a creature finds itself bereft of such valuable possessions, the cost will instead be paid with its body, cleaving away entire limbs as necessary.


### Unending Thirst

> A curse that renders a creature unable to benefit from drinking, slowly killing them through dehydration.


### Unholy water

> [[Cleric|Clerics]] and other spellcasters with access to the spell *curse water*, who are usually evil, may use it to create [[Unholy water|unholy water]].


### Unluck

> Being cursed with unluck makes the recipient of the curse incredibly unlucky.


### Vampirism

> Some claim that vampirism is a curse, though some [[Vampire|vampires]] would dispute this claim; [[Nosferatu]] vampires would not.


### Vulnerability

> This curse makes the victim hurt significantly more when damaged by energy, for instance, lightning or fire.


### Wendigo psychosis

> This curse is also a [[Diseases of GolarionWendigo psychosis|disease]].


### Witch's hex

> A [[Witch|witch]] can use a hex to curse a creature or even the land itself.


### Wizard's Ward

> A curse used to protect books from nationalization, most commonly [[Wizard|wizards]]' spellbooks. When a creature damages the book they suffer the same harm and can only be healed of it by repairing the book.
