>  The **boar** or **wild boar** is a more ornery and dangerous cousin of the domesticated [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Level 1/Pig]]. They can be found in the woodlands of much of [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]], and are frequently hunted for their flesh, which is considered a delicacy.



## Habitat and ecology

>  Boars can breed freely and quickly, and eat voraciously and omnivorously, making them a menace to farmers and food storage. They become more aggressive during mating season, with males growing additional flesh to protect themselves during conflicts over mates, but otherwise attack only in self-defense.


## Boar hunting

>  Boars are often hunted with special [[spears]] that include a cross-beam that keep the impaled [[Animal]] from pushing forward and goring its attacker with its powerful tusks.


## Uses of boars

>  Boars are omnivores that will not shy away from eating anything remotely palatable. This makes them useful for disposing of garbage, and boars are sometimes kept by [[orcs]] or [[kobolds]], who use them as mounts and let them roam free in their camps, or by thieves' guilds for getting rid of organic evidence. They are also trained to become warbeasts and guard animals.

## Animal companions

>  Boars and dire boars have been selected variously by [[cavaliers]], [[druids]], [[paladins]], and [[rangers]] as their [[companion animals]]. Dire boars are particularly favoured of [[Orc]] cavaliers and druids.


## Variants

>  A wide variety of boar species exists across [[Golarion]], from the **warthogs** of the tropical plains and savannas, the [[Sargavan boar]] of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] and [[Sargava]], to the **blood boar** of [[Razmiran's]] [[Exalted Wood]]. In [[Taldor]], [[titanboars]] have been bred to be particularly challenging hunting quarry, but often become feral and cause great damage to the countryside. Enormous, armor-plated [[steam hogs]] are used as war beasts by [[Fire giant]] armies.


### Bristle boar


>  **Bristle boars** are a species of boar resident in the lowlands of the [[Hold of Belkzen]] and are as tough as anything emerging from that land. Their defining characteristic are the nasty spines that protect their head and neck. These bristles are used as a vicious adjunct to any gore attack by the boars and deal particularly bloody wounds. Bristle boars tower above normal boars at four feet in height but are much leaner, so weigh roughly the same at about 200 lbs, and provide little meat to any hunter desperate enough to prey on them. Some Belkzen residents train bristle boars to be animal companions.


### Daeodon


>  The **dire boar** or **daeodon** is a much larger, and much more aggressive relative of the common wild boar. While wild boars are omnivores, dire boars prefer the taste of fresh meat, and their keen senses and large, sharp tusks make them superior predators. Primarily scavengers, daeodons occasionally attack smaller, lone individuals if no easier source of food is present. Orcs sometimes use dire boars as mounts, and dire boar-mounted orc cavalry can be a truly terrifying sight. They are generally at least ten feet in length and seven feet tall at the shoulder, weighing upwards of 2,000 pounds.


### Warthog

>  Faster than common boars and less aggressive, warthogs originate and are found in numbers in the Mwangi Expanse. They sport large tusks and armoured ridges on their facesâ€”the latter often mistaken as the warts from which they are named.
