> **Bogeymen** are terrifying [[Fey|fey]] who devour innocence and steal [[Soul|souls]]. Depending on their relative power and size, they are classified as **bogeys**, **bugaboos**, or bogeymen.



## Appearance

> All bogeymen are male. They are tall and fanged, wear a long dark coat and a tall hat, and exude an aura of fear.


## Ecology

> Bogeymen methodically stalk and torment a single person at a time, usually a young child or elder, for days or even weeks at a time. Bogeys typically hide under a bed, in a dark attic, or in a slightly ajar closet, while the more sophisticated bogeymen might ominously appear in shadowy back alleys or street corners. From there, they hint at their presence to methodically cultivate the victims' realisation that they are not alone, before fully revealing themselves. Devouring three souls in a year causes a bogey to transform into a bugaboo; six souls are needed for a bugaboo to become a bogeyman.
> Sometimes, instead of killing his victim, a bogeyman might kidnap them and bring them to a far-off location. Years later, they return with a fresh bogey in tow; superstition says that these bogeys are transformed victims, coming back to terrify the town they once called home.
> The most [[Evil|evil]] bogeymen, not satisfied with feeding on one victim's fears, take up pursuits that instil fear into entire cities, like mass murder.


## Society

> Bogeymen usually target small communities, where gossip can amplify their dark deeds. They sow discord and hide from scrutiny by exploiting people's tendency to spread fake news, knowing that few would believe a bogeyman to be the culprit of the mysterious murders.
