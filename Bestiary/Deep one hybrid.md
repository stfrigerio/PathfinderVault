> **Deep one hybrids** are the hybrid children of [[Deep one|deep ones]] and [[Human|humans]].



## Appearance

> Deep one hybrids resemble humans with an abnormally wide mouth, bulging eyes and webbed hands.


## Ecology

> Deep one hybrids are born from unions between deep ones and surface-dwelling [[Humanoid|humanoids]], most commonly humans, as a way for the deep ones to spread their blasphemous religion above the waves. A deep one hybrid ages at the same rate as a [[Half-orc|half-orc]], before transforming into a mature deep one at the age of 60.


## Society

> Deep one hybrids typically live near other hybrids and cluster in insular towns where they can assume positions of leadership. Full-blooded humans in these towns are cowed and subservient to the hybrids. Deep one hybrids are devout followers of the [[Outer God|Outer Gods]] or [[Great Old One|Great Old Ones]], but usually pretend to worship a more conventional [[Deity|deity]] to avoid suspicion from visitors and other communities.
