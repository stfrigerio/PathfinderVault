*See also: [[Janni]]Â and [[Half-janni|half-janni]]*
> **Sulis** are [[Geniekin|geniekin]] touched by all four (or two) [[Element|elements]]. They possess considerable power over the elementsâ€”including the ability to enshroud their arms in acid, ice, electricity, or fireâ€”and they are often considered blessed for their [[Genie|genie]] heritage (especially among the [[Human|humans]] of [[Qadira]]).



## Appearance

> Sulis are the most humanlike geniekin, to the point that they are nearly indistinguishable as children and can pass as tall, beautiful members of their [[Mortal|mortal]] parent's [[Race|race]] as adults. Sulis stand out for their vibrant eyes, brilliant bronze skin, and the charm and intensity from their heritage.


## Adventurers

> [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|Alchemists]], [[Wizard|wizards]] and others that focus on creation or the combination of elements appeal to the multi-elemental nature of many sulis, while others pursue callings such as the [[Bard's End|bard]] that combines martial and magical capabilities. Suli [[Monk|monks]] often focus their attention inward, harnessing the elemental potential inside themselves and exploring their inherent connection to the elements through their martial art.


## Ecology

> Sulis are most often the result of unions between mortal [[Humanoid|humanoids]] (usually humans) and [[Janni|jann]]; in this case, they are known as **suli-jann**. Two non-suli geniekin of different types can also produce suli offspring, as can dual-elemental beings and humanoids; the resulting suli will only possess an affinity for these elements. Suli heritage is usually only known and manifested in adolescence (usually accidentally), or when awakened by an encounter with a [[Genie|genie]].
> Unlike other geniekin, sulis only live for as long as humans do, and their human nature expresses more in their development due to their weaker elemental influence. Signs of janni heritage are easily misinterpreted, and many sulis have been mistaken for [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]].


## Society

> Sulis are usually boastful, arrogant, and consider bragging a cultural institution. They boast about their own accomplishments as well as their friends and family, seeking to be remembered for centuries. They are competitive and stubborn, leading to explosive interactions with equally acerbic people.
> Sulis are friendly with [[Halfling|halflings]], due to their mutual hatred of [[Slavery|slavery]]. Humans and [[Half-elf|half-elves]] are also considered to be friends, and sulis often pass as them in hostile lands.
> Sulis become [[Adventurer|adventurers]] most often to meet people and travel to exotic lands, which they value as much as wealth and power. Their empathy can also motivate sulis to take action against all kinds of threats. Due to their natural charm, sulis are likely to become leaders or take responsibility for diplomacy.


### Religion

> Sulis often venerate multiple [[Deity|deities]] at once. Those who seek strength to exact revenge on societies who mistreat them worship an [[Elemental lord|elemental lord]] (or all four), and others follow [[The Lantern King|the Lantern King]], finding his laughter warming and his fickle tricks appealing.


## On Golarion

> On [[Golarion]], sulis are most commonly born to the nomadic jann clans on the continent of [[Casmaron]]. The jann greatly value self-promotion, and encourage their offspring to brag about theirÂ achievements. They often send sulis into human society, hoping that they make good impressions and soften the stance of the [[Kelesh|Keleshite]] government regarding genie slavery.
> Elemental [[Wizard|wizards]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemists]], most often in [[Thuvia]], also purposefully seek to internalise elemental forces to give birth to sulis. In [[Merab]], in particular, sulis are prized for their connection to the four elements, and suli alchemists often have a knack for element-infused creations.
