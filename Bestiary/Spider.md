> **Spiders** are air-breathing [[arthropods]] that have eight legs and [[chelicerae]] with fangs that inject [[venom]]. There are thousands of different species of spiders that live in nearly every biome on [[Golarion]] that vary greatly in size. The smallest spiders can still pose a threat to most [[humanoids]] when they swarm, while the largest **goliath spiders** are bigger than a house.
