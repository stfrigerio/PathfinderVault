> One of the most infamous [[Froghemoth|froghemoths]] is the (fortunately now deceased) **Beast of Bloodcove**. Over the course of the unusually hot summer of [[4696 AR]] this immense froghemoth went on the rampage in the vicinity of the town of [[Bloodcove]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. The Beast killed 204 people before finally being slain by a party of twelve heroes.
