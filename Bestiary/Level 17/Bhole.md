> **Bholes**, sometimes called **dholes** on other worlds, are titanic worms so large that few have ever seen a whole specimen in one view. Their mouths have long jaws with protruding bones that can extend and unfold while feeding. Each can be of many colors, from dark blues or purples to pale gray or yellow to bleached white.
