> **Shinigamis** are a race of [[Outsider|outsiders]] from the [[Boneyard]] who impartially and professionally hunt down those who would seek to disrupt the balance of life.


## Appearance

> A shinigami resembles an emaciated, robed [[Humanoid|humanoid]] with skeletal wings that wields a bone scythe. It is nine feet tall and weighs 130 pounds.


## Ecology

> The merciless shinigamis seek to inflict quick, just deaths upon their quarries, do not seek to impose needless suffering, and do not take pleasure in their jobs. There are exceptions: some individual shinigamis, considered rogues by others, are either willing to listen to their victims' plight and grant clemency; or are willing to be bribed to let certain dastardly targets survive.
> Resurrection sometimes falls under a shinigami's purview, if the subject's return perturbs social or natural order. However, some shinigamis use their mandate as an excuse to get rid of resurrected [[Mortality|mortals]] when bribed.
