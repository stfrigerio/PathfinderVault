The target must attempt a DC 43 Will save.\n__Critical Success__ The target disbelieves the lies and receives the intended benefit of the spell; the target becomes temporarily immune to Whispers of Discord for 24 hours.\n__Success__ As critical success, but the target isn't temporarily immune.\n__Failure__ The spell fails to affect the target.

Celestials and fiends gain a +2 status bonus to this save.\n__Critical Success__ The target is unaffected and temporarily immune to Whisper Earworm for 24 hours.\n__Success__ The target is unaffected.\n__Failure__ The next time the target rests, it ruminates on the deimavigga's words instead of sleeping or otherwise resting and awakens [[fatigued|fatigued]]. The target also becomes [[drained|drained 1]] and [[stupefied|stupefied 1]] until it's no longer [[fatigued|fatigued]].\n__Critical Failure__ As failure, but [[drained|drained 2]]. After this rest, the target must attempt another DC 43 Will save. On a failure, the target becomes [[stupefied|stupefied 2]] and takes a –4 status penalty to Will saves against effects from evil creatures. These effects last until the target unlearns the truth spoken by the deimavigga, requiring a [[modify memory]] spell, other means of modifying their memory, or powerful magic such as [[wish]]."

> The powerful **deimaviggas** or **apostate devils** are the missionaries of [[Hell]], seeking to turn righteous men and women from their faiths and toward the easy self-aggrandizement and [[Atheism|atheism]] of the Pits. Deimaviggas are bastions of the cold logic of Hell and most often work alone, as even the most devoted of assistants can get in the way of their carefully laid plans.



## Appearance

> Deimaviggas, in their native form, appear as fully-armored warriors with long, vicious claws. The [[Devil|devils]] have no neck with their metallic head floating above their torso. Deimaviggas can, however, change shape into any [[Humanoid|humanoid]] they so choose in mere seconds.


## Abilities

> Despite being fierce foes in combat, deimaviggas are much more likely to manipulate and corrupt rather than slash and stab. Deimaviggas are able to disrupt [[Divine magic|divine]] [[Healing|healing]] through their lies to the target, disrupting both the [[Spell|spell]] and the target's willingness to trust their healer. Larger lies can disrupt a target's very belief in existence and the [[Deity|gods]] themselves, leading to a sort of listless nihilism in the victims of the deimavigga. Augmenting this, the devils also possess strong mind control magic. When melee combat is necessary, the long claws of a deimavigga can cut through [[Time|time]] and space, arriving at any target the deimavigga can see—[[Magic|magically]] or physically—to strike it.
