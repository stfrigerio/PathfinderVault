> **Winterwights** (sometimes called **hatewraiths** because of their love of suffering) are [[Undead|undead]] creatures born from the darkest, coldest depths of the [[Negative Energy Plane]]. They appear as sturdy [[Skeleton|skeletons]] clothed in jagged ice armor. Unlike lesser undead, winterwights can never be created by [[Mortal|mortal]] spellcasters.


## On Golarion

> Although they are generally found in the northernmost latitudes of [[Avistan]], the most well-known winterwight, [[Dissayn]], makes her home in the [[Garden of Lead]] in the  [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Virlych]]. They have also been spotted in the Slave district of the fabled city of [[Xin-Shalast]], and the [[Ice Spire]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]].
