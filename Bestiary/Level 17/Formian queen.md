> The **formian queen** is the leader and sole egg-layer of the [[Formian|formian]] hive.


## Ecology

> The formian queen's body is bound to the central chamber, where she meets with her [[Formian myrmarch|myrmarchs]] while her massive abdomen constantly squeezes out egg after egg. Despite this immobility, she can possess the minds of her children to directly see what happens elsewhere in the hive, and more active queens use this ability to confront intruders.
> In rare cases, if a formian queen dies, a [[Formian warrior|formian warrior]], normally sterile, might spontaneously become fertile to replace her.
