> **Kaminaris**, or **thunder kami**, are a type of [[Kami|kami]] who watch over storm clouds and the balance of weather.



## Appearance

> Kaminaris have vibrant skin and features; the specific hues vary from kaminari to kaminari. More monstrous-looking and boisterous than most kami, kaminaris are often mistaken for [[Oni|oni]] upon first glance. A kaminari stands roughly 25 feet tall and weighs about ten tons. Kaminaris surround themselves with booming noises and are rarely seen without their favourite [[Musical instrument|musical instrument]], most often a percussion one.


## Ecology

> Kaminaris care little for most [[Mortal|mortals]], primarily concerning themselves with the maintenance and protection of their wards. A kaminari commands powers of lightning and thunder, but only has a limited ability to control the movement of its ward, and is often merely a passenger upon storm clouds. A storm with a kaminari is more permanent than most weather patterns, and could exist for a potentially infinite amount of time if neither it nor the kaminari is corrupted or destroyed.
> Kaminaris despise [[Magic|magical]] weather manipulation, and attempts to disrupt their wards often result in their unabashed wrath. Though not [[Evil|evil]], kaminaris are more short-tempered, destructive, and less tolerant of nuisances compared to other kami, and are quick to exterminate anything deemed a threat to the natural balance of weather, whether that threat be an evil [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]] seeking to destroy a city or a [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|benevolent]] [[Wizard|wizard]] summoning rain to end a long drought.


## Society

> Due to their habitat, kaminaris are isolated, reclusive, and never actively interfere with mortals except when required by the *Laws of Golden Perfection*. Once a kaminari has fulfilled its required duty, it is only too happy to leave.
> Kaminaris are devoted to [[Music|music]]; the intensity of a kaminari's storm usually corresponds to the aggression with which it plays its instrument. Kaminaris are often among the best players of their instruments, rivalling the most talented [[Bard's End|bards]]. They have a great affection for bards who practise an instrument, and will occasionally interrupt their guardianship to accompany a fellow virtuoso.
> A kaminari's choice of instrument is usually a fair indicator of its temperament as well as its kind of ward: those who play keyboards are usually found amid storms that wander deserts; players of string instruments live in oceanic hurricanes; and kaminaris who use wind instruments occupy blizzards.
