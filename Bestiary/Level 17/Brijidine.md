> **Brijidines** are among the most powerful of the [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azata]] races. They are attuned to the power of both earth and fire, and have an intense love of poetry and spicy food.
> Brijidine are adored by [[Mote archon|mote archons]], who often devote themselves to the fiery patrons for long periods. Such devotion cannot last forever, however, and eventually mote archons tire of the azata's fickle (to the archon's mind, at least) interpretation of [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|goodness]].
