> **Lusca** are a terror of the sea, a seemingly gargantuan cross between a three-headed [[Shark|shark]] and an [[Octopus|octopus]].



## Appearance

> Luscas often grow longer than 90 feet from the snout to the end of their tentacles, and weigh up to 3,800 pounds.


## Abilities

> The flesh of a lusca is superconductive, and can stir electrical storms spanning two miles in radius should they linger near the surface for more than an hour. It can also control and unleash lightning and accompanying winds.
> Its tentacles are [[Poisons of Golarion|venomous]], delivering a debilitating poison upon contact.
> Luscas can smell blood from a mile away, and see in the dark.


## On Golarion

> Luscas are at home in [[Golarion|Golarions]] warmer oceans, lurking deep in lightless sinkholes that plunge far beneath the sea floor. They are not the dominant predators in these depths, which they share with [[Aboleth|aboleths]] and [[Kraken|krakens]], but they are powerful enough to capsize and sink [[Ship|ships]] when they approach the surface.


## In the Great Beyond

> Luscas are among the predators native to the [[Jungle of Worms]] in the [[Plane of Water]].
