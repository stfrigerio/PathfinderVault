## History

>  During the [[ First Mendevian Crusade]], the native [[druids]] of the [[Estrovian Forest]], angry at the influx of foreigners, transformed a trespassing [[Andoren]] huntsman called [[Herne Vilhaur]] into a monster. The resulting creature was full of malice. It killed its creators, and then began indiscriminately killing all it found within the forestâ€”sometimes transferring its curse and creating more of its kind in the process. These creatures are known as "hernes" as a result.
