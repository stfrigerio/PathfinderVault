> **Slaugraks** are large, freakish, bestial [[Troglodyte|troglodyte]] mutants born with the taint of the [[Abyss]].


## Appearance

> A slaugrak resembles a troglodyte bristling with twitching limbs, milk-white eyes and drooling half-formed mouths on its torso. Its maw is oversized and filled with curved [[Sickle|sickle]]-like teeth. A typical slaugrak stands 12 to 14 feet tall and weighs 6,000 pounds.


## Ecology

> From birth, a slaugrak is filled with an abnormal hunger for flesh and has few thoughts other than killing and eating. Slaugraks only take two weeks to mature and are sterile, holding no special love for troglodytes. A well-fed slaugrak might form a bond with its troglodyte keeper, but this only goes so far as making the slaugrak likely to eat the keeper last.
