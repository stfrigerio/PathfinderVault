> **Babaus** are [[Demon|demonic]] assassins. Their coating of red slime means babau are sometimes referred to as **blood demons**.



## Associated Sin

> Murder


## Appearance

> A babau looks like a thin, horned [[Human|human]] covered in a tight-fitting hide of slimy leather. A typical specimen is 6 feet in height and weighs 140 pounds.


## Habitat and society

> Babau demons are formed in the [[Abyss]] from the [[Soul|souls]] of solitary killersâ€”not merely mass murderers, but those who killed with deliberation and intimacy.
> They delight in well-planned murders and think nothing of waiting in ambush for decades if necessary; such stealth and patience sets them apart from most other demons. They might even adopt a "calling card", typically of a grisly nature, to leave behind at the scenes of their crimes.
> They revere the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Shax]] as the creator of their race. Shax can create the most powerful of the babau demons by skinning living victims and filling them with the energy of the [[Abyss]].
> Some [[BalorBalor lord|Balor Lords]] have the ability to inhale a living creature's soul, killing the victim instantly and transforming its corpse into a babau or other demon of similar power.


## Abilities

> A babau prefers to fight using its teeth and claws, but often carries a weapon such as a longspear to enable it to strike foes that would otherwise be outside its reach.
> The slime that coats their bodies is acidic and can damage [[Weapon|weapons]] and injure flesh that touches it.


## Environment

> In [[Golarion]], babaus can be found in the [[Tanglebriar]] swamp in [[Kyonin]], as part of the forces of [[Treerazer]].


> [[Paizo]] published a sourcebook about demons called *[[Demons Revisited]]*, which includes a chapter about babaus.
