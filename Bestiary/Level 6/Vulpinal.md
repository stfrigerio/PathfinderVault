> **Vulpinals**, also known as **fox agathions**, are a race of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fox|fox]]-like [[Agathion|agathion]] that make their home on the [[Outer Sphere]] of [[Nirvana]]. Vulpinals often serve as [[Music|musicians]] and minstrels, traveling widely throughout Nirvana to have different cultural experiences.


## Appearance

> Vulpinals are short creatures with [[Humanoid|humanoid]] thumbed-hands ending in claws. Their fox-like tails can be almost as long as the rest of their bodies. Though they typically have red fur, their leaders often have white or black grey-flecked pelts. As consummate travelers, vulpinals dress practically-yet-stylishly, picking their favorite styles and accoutrements from their journeys.


## Known vulpinals
