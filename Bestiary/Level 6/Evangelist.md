*This article is about the [[Velstrac|velstrac]] species. For the prestige class, see [[Evangelist prestige class]].*
> **Evangelists** are a class of [[Velstrac|velstrac]]. "Evangelist" is their proper name in velstrac society; they are also known as **chain devils**.



## Appearance

> Evangelist velstracs resemble lean [[Human|humans]], but have deathly pale flesh covered with vicious scars. They are almost always wrapped and draped in barbed chains that cut their flesh and weigh them down; a typical velstrac weighs more than 350 pounds.


## Abilities

> Evangelists have embraced the chains that once bound their race in the pit of [[Hell]]. They have a supernatural connection to chains, granting them the ability to mentally animate chains in their proximity. They can [[Magic|magically]] lengthen any chain they use and cause it to sprout razor-sharp barbs.
> Like all velstracs, evangelists have an unnerving gaze that inspires terror in its victims. An evangelist can cause any who look upon its face to see the visage of a long-lost loved one or hated enemy, causing them to quake with fear.


## In the Great Beyond

> Most of the velstracs who still reside in Hell are evangelists.


### Known evangelists

> - Vreet-Hall, servant of Zon-Kuthon

> [[Paizo]] referred to evangelist velstracs as simply **kytons** or **chain devils** in some early [[Pathfinder campaign setting]] products.
