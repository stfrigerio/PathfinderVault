> Members of the [[Caulborn|caulborn]] subrace known as **chrestomaths** look like giant hovering brains. These caulborn are responsible for storing their people's racial memory, as well as the memories they have stolen from other creatures. They are closely guarded by members of their hive, particularly [[Caulborn thoughtkeeper|caulborn thoughtkeepers]], some of whom become this more advanced form of caulborn from their exposure to a chrestomath.
