If it moves at least 20 feet and succeeds at its [[Strike]], the hodag deals damage normally and then attempts an [[Athletics]] check against the creature's Fortitude DC to toss the enemy into the air. On a success, the tossed creature is thrown 10 feet in a straight line in the direction of the hodag's choice and then lands [[prone|prone]]. If the creature is knocked into a solid object, it takes 1d6 (1d6) bludgeoning damage as well before landing [[prone|prone]]. The hodag can instead toss a creature straight up in the air. The creature lands in the same square where it started, takes 1d6 (1d6) bludgeoning damage, and lands [[prone|prone]]."
