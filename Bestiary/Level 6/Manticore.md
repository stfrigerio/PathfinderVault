> **Manticores** are monstrous winged predators that combine the features of several creatures into a deadly whole.



## Appearance

> A manticore has the body of an immense [[Lion|lion]] the size of a [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]], the wings of a [[Dragon|dragon]], and a long tail ending in a cluster of vicious spikes. Some manticores have a lion's head, but others have the face of a snarling bearded [[Human|human]] with razor-sharp teeth. Unlike lions or humans, both male and female manticores have manes or beards.


## Ecology

> It is unknown how manticores came into existence, though [[Magic|magic]] is assumed to be involved. Manticores are not picky eaters; they are ravenous eaters of meat, whether freshly killed or rotting carrion. They patrol vast stretches of land seeking food.
> Manticores are strangely fecund and capable of interbreeding with other lion-like creatures, including common lions, [[Dire lion|dire lions]], [[Lamia|lamias]], [[Sphinx|sphinxes]], and [[Chimera|chimeras]]. Such crossbreeds are usually members of the mate's species, but with manticore features, such as a chimera with a spiked tail.


## Habitat and society

> Manticores are more than dumb beasts. Though not as smart as a human, they are thinking creatures capable of speech, and often strike deals with or bully [[Evil|evil]] [[Humanoid|humanoids]] into working with or for them, often employing such creatures to guard their lairs. They make their homes in high places like hilltops and cliffside caves.
> Manticores are known to revere the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Barbatos]] and the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Nurgal]].


## Abilities

> Manticores have keen senses and are skilled trackers. They possess great strength, ripping claws and fangs, and the power of flight, but their most unusual feature is the ability to whip their tails and launch a volley of spikes at their prey. The spikes rapidly grow back over the course of a day.


## On Golarion

> Manticores have been encountered in the [[Hold of Belkzen]], on the [[Nesmian Plains]] of southern [[Nirmathas]], in the hills in the [[Mwangi Expanse]], in the [[Takalak Hills]] on [[Motaku Isle]] in the [[Shackles]], in the [[Gembasket]] of [[Katapesh]], and in the hills of [[Glenebon]] in the [[Stolen Lands]] of the [[River Kingdoms]]. They are rumored to live on [[Bag Island]] in the [[Shackles]]. They were once hunted by the warriors of [[Sarkoris]] in what is now the [[Worldwound]]. In [[Varisia]], manticores are found in the hinterlands of [[Magnimar]], the [[Stony Mountains]], and the [[Devil's Elbow|Devils Elbow]].
> Manticores are encountered on occasion in the [[Darkmoon Vale]] of [[Andoran]], where they inhabit [[Arthfell Forest]] and [[Darkmoon Wood]]. The [[Greenfire Circle]] and Fangwatch keep their numbers in check, and many have fled north to the [[Five Kings Mountains]]. A powerful manticore named [[Grazhgaugh]] closely guards a grove in Darkmoon Wood; some say he is guarding an ancient [[Elf|elven]] [[Artifact|artifact]].
> Two prides of manticores live in the Roiling Den, in the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Corentyn]], where they aid in the protection of the city through a partnership with the [[Human|human]] [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|ranger]] and [[Chelish Navy]] [[Frazura Antelo|Lieutenant Frazura Antelo]].
> Manticores also sometimes venture into the upper caverns of [[Nar-Voth]].
