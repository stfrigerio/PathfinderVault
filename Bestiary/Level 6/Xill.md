> **Xills** are alien, plane-shifting marauders from the [[Ethereal Plane]] who ravage everything in their path for one singular purpose: reproduction.



## Appearance

> A xill is a four-armed humanoid with spiny, bright red skin. Xills resemble a mix between [[Human|human]], reptile, and insect, possessing fanged mandibles and a scaled hide.


## Ecology

> All xills are female, and they fertilize their own eggs, but they require a host body to incubate their eggs before they hatch. For this reason, they use their [[Poison|poisoned]] mandibles to paralyze their victims and implant eggs in their bodies with an ovipositor usually kept retracted behind their jaws. Xills particularly favor [[Phase spider|phase spiders]] as incubators.
> Xills have the ability to shift between the Ethereal Plane and [[Material Plane]] at will, though moving from the Material to the Ethereal is more difficult and time-consuming than the reverse.


## Habitat and society

> Xills inhabit the gray mists of the Ethereal Plane. They are highly intelligent, with a repressive, militaristic culture. Due to their need to reproduce, they are driven toward conquest, constantly seeking new incubators for their eggs. Xills often find themselves in conflict with the more powerful [[Night hag|night hags]], and are in a state of eternal war with the [[Phase spider|phase spiders]], their favored source of incubators. Xills and [[Destrachan|destrachans]] are mortal enemies.


## On Golarion

> - [[Ilthyrius|Runelord Ilthyrius]], the ruler of [[Haruka]] in ancient [[Thassilon]], conjured a contingent of xill to infiltrate the [[Demiplane|demiplane]] of [[Runeforge]] when its artificers failed him.
> - A strange subspecies of [[Chaotic|chaotic]], green-scaled xills inhabits the ruins of [[Valashai]] in the [[Valashmai Jungle]]. These xills, native to the Material Plane, take [[Slavery|slaves]] to use as incubators. They prize [[Arcane magic|arcane magic]], and tribes are led by [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]] or [[Summoner|summoners]] with ties to the [[Abyss]].
> - Xills have been encountered in the devastated [[The Furrows|Furrows]] of [[Ustalav]].
> - The xill Qiloc is an interplanar bounty hunter currently in the employ of [[Olordaera]], attempting to hunt down [[Shimon-Je]].
