> The **titanboar** is a hybrid of [[Verduran Forest|Verduran]] [[Boar|boars]] and [[Daeodon|daeodons]] from the [[River Kingdoms]], bred by [[Taldor|Taldan]] nobles for size and ferocity. Titanboars are prized by hunters seeking to prove their prowess, and their gamy flesh is popularly speculated to enhance virility, leading some old nobles to carry [[Dagger|daggers]] and jewellery made from titanboar tusk to show their longevity. Due to their ravenous appetites, titanboars are dangerous when released into the wild (especially when they find a wild mate to produce an entire daeodon herd), leading many [[Prefecture|prefectures]] to ban titanboar breeding.
