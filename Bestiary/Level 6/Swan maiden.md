> **Swan maidens** are female [[Fey|fey]] that serve as protectors of wild and pristine lakes and swamps.


## Appearance

> Swan maidens have two forms: they appear either as a trumpeter swan, or as a beautiful woman clad in a cloak of swan feathers. In [[Human|human]] form, swan maidens also normally wear [[Arms|arms]] and [[Armour|armour]] to protect them against those who would despoil their home. Normally, this consists of chainmail, and they wield either a [[Rapier|rapier]] or a [[Longsword|longsword]], as well as a longbow.


## Habitat and Ecology

> Swan maidens dwell amongst unspoiled temperate lakes and swamps, which they vow to protect from both [[Evil|evil]] and the ever-expanding threat of civilisation. Swan maidens normally live in small groups called flocks. Swan maidens are able to shift between human and swan form using their swan-feather cloaks, however, without these, they are trapped in human form. They are distrustful of humans as they not only spread civilisation but often try to steal the beautiful swan-feather cloaks of the swan maidens.
