## History

> In [[4329 AR]], the pirate queen [[Mastrien Slash]] led an army of warrior women in an invasion of the undead kingdom of [[Geb's Rest]]. They were driven north by conflict in their southern land of [[Holomog]], and sought to create a new home for themselves. [[Geb (person)|Geb]], the ghostly [[Necromancer|necromancer-king]] of Geb, turned the entire army to stone, and today they are known as the Field of Maidens.
