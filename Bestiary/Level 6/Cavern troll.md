> **Rock trolls**, also known as **cavern trolls**, are a species of rocky-skinned [[Troll|trolls]] that inhabit the [[Darklands]].


## Appearance

> Rock trolls resemble common trolls with rocky, flinty skin, which becomes studded with various kinds of [[Gem|gems]] and stones as the troll ages. Their mouths are wide and bristling with crystalline fangs. A rock troll stands fourteen feet tall and weighs approximately 2,000 pounds.


## Ecology

> Rock trolls possess a particular vulnerability to [[Sun|sunlight]], becoming sluggish under direct exposure and eventually becoming fully petrified. As a result, rock trolls chiefly inhabit the Darklands and rarely emerge onto the surface. However, they also lack other trolls' vulnerability to fire, and can regenerate wounds inflicted by flame without complications.
> Rock trolls are voracious omnivores, and will consume anything they encounter. They can subsist on rocks and minerals when meat is scarce, and will also devour [[Xorn|xorns]] when they encounter them; rock trolls who consume multiple xorns eventually develop tremorsense. However, xorns will also attempt to consume the gem-studded rock trolls, leading to ferocious clashes when groups of the two creatures encounter each other.
