> **Ettins**, also known as **two-headed giants**, are dim-witted but vicious [[Giant|giant]]-kin whose two heads make them exceptionally perceptive.



## Appearance

> Ettins are similar in appearance to [[Hill giant|hill]] and [[Stone giant|stone giants]] with tusked faces like [[Orc|orcs]]. Their skin is pinkish-brown, stained gray with filth and grime due to their terrible hygiene. Ettins stand around thirteen feet tall and weigh about 5,200 pounds. They have a life span of about 75 years.


## Habitat and society

> Ettins favor cold, hilly regions. They make their homes in caves or hollows, often surrounded by pits and other obstacles. They prefer solitude, usually coming together only to breed, after which the two ettins go their separate ways. Ettins reach adult size in only one year, at which time their mother drives them out of the lair.
> Despite their brutish tendencies and lack of intelligence, ettins are canny fighters who prefer to ambush their prey. Each head controls one side of their body, allowing them to fight effectively with two weapons at once without any special training. They prefer [[Flail|flails]] in combat.
> Powerful ettins may gather a gang of [[Orc|orc]] or [[Goblin|goblin]] followers, or even other ettins, but due to the two-headed giants' individualist nature, such arrangements tend to fall apart fairly quickly. Ettins often keep [[Bear|dire bears]] as pets. They sometimes ally with [[Troll|trolls]] to protect their hunting grounds. They have also been known to ally with flocks of [[Harpy|harpies]] who find the brutish ettins too stupid to enjoy torturing and killing.
> Ettins speak a pidgin of the the [[Nonhuman languages of GolarionGiant|Giant]], [[Nonhuman languages of GolarionGoblin|Goblin]], and [[Nonhuman languages of GolarionOrc|Orc]] languages. Native speakers of any of these languages can understand an ettin's speech with some effort.


### Religion

> Ettins are known to worship [[Kostchtchie]], the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of giants, frost, and revenge. Although most ettins are evil and short-sighted, the uncharacteristically introspective and morally neutral faith of the Children of Balance has found considerable traction among the two-headed giants. The faith, worshiping the dualistic gods [[Pharasma]], [[Gozreh]], and [[Nethys]], appeals to the ettins' divided sense of self, promising harmony between their twin personalities.


## On Golarion

> Ettins can be found throughout [[Golarion]], with populations inhabiting such far-flung regions as the [[Mana Wastes]] [[Taldor]] the [[Hold of Belkzen]] the [[River Kingdoms]] [[Kaoling]] and the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]].
> Ettins are especially common in [[Varisia]]. They were among the giants enslaved by the [[Runelords|runelords]] of ancient [[Thassilon]], and were favored slaves of the rulers of [[Edasseril]]. Some ettins have gathered under the banner of [[Mokmurian|Lord Mokmurian]], a powerful [[Stone giant|stone giant]] warlord of the [[Storval Plateau]].


### Notable Ettins

*See also: [[CategoryEttinInhabitants]]*
> Notable ettins include:

> - [[Nghiem]], who plans on building a kingdom from his base in the [[Maiaji|Ruins of Maiaji]] using an army of his own children as the cornerstone of his future dynasty.
> - [[Romrix]], head of polytheistic faith known as the Children of Balance.
> - [[Zalla-Kyzah]], an aspiring ettin warlord who seeks to raise an army in the Conquered Lands of the [[Hold of Belkzen]].
