> The **ankylosaurus** is a huge, squat [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaur]] covered in thick bony plates and spikes. They are found alone, in pairs, or in herds of up to a dozen creatures.
> They are herbivores, but tend to stand their ground when threatened. In combat, an ankylosaurus uses the bony end of its powerful tail as a club. If it flees, smaller creatures in their path are likely to be trampled.
> A typical specimen is 30 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds or 3 tons.
