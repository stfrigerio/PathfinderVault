> A **hungry fog** is a vaporous [[Ooze|ooze]] that looks like an [[Incorporeal undead|incorporeal undead]], but actually takes its form from creatures it consumes.



## Appearance

> This ooze floats in the air like a cloud of green fog, with phantasmic shapes drifting within. The light of what appears to be a lantern sometimes shines from within, only to be replaced by a skull when something approaches.


## Abilities

> A hungry fog is infused with [[Negative energy|negative energy]]; living creatures engulfed by it suffer its detrimental effects, while [[Undead|undead]] are empowered by it. The shapes that drift within can entrance weak-willed witnesses.


## Ecology

## Known examples

> A hungry fog inhabits the Crow, a piling of the [[Irespan]] in [[Magnimar]].
