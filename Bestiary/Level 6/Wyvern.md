>  **Wyverns** are a race of venomous [[drakes]] known for their aggressive personalities.



## Appearance

>  Wyverns average around 15 feet in length and normally weigh about 2,000 pounds. While wyverns resemble blue-coloured [[dragons]], the most obvious differences being their lack of front arms, as they have only rear legs and wings, and their tails ending in [[venomous]] stingers.


## Habitat and ecology

>  Wyverns favour warm and temperate areas, particularly hills, although they can dwell in many environments. They usually claim an area from 100 to 200 square miles as their exclusive hunting territory and fight other wyverns to the death over their domain.
>  Wyverns are highly aggressive creatures, and though capable of speech have little interest in conversation beyond taunting prey, issuing territorial challenges or demanding tribute. These violent tendencies and lack of sophistication results in most dragons seeing wyverns as hopelessly primitive savages.
>  When hunting, wyverns prefer to crash into their targets talon-first, as their resilient bodies take little damage from such collisions, in order to stun their prey before injecting it with venom or carrying it over a cliff. As wyverns lack the strength to carry intact prey items in flight for extended periods of time, they prefer to drop subdued prey from great heights and afterwards pick through their remains.
>  Wyverns are distant relatives of [[amphipteres]], which unlike them lack even their hind legs and possess only a pair of wings. Both species possess long tails tipped with inborn weapons; unlike a wyvern's poisonous stinger, however, an amphiptere's tail ends in a sharp spur used primarily to spear targets.


## Society

>  Due to their aggressive tendencies, wyverns are normally solitary creatures, though they sometimes band together to hunt larger prey that a single wyvern cannot kill alone. Wyverns can sometimes control their violent urges long enough to ally with others, such as [[giants]] and tribes of violent [[monstrous humanoids]]. There have even been reports of tribes of [[Lizardfolk]] and [[boggards]] that have bribed wyverns to serve them as mounts. Despite their otherwise antisocial tendencies, wyverns enjoy grim humor and violent tales, and can be appeased with meat, treasure and flattery to serve as guardians or steeds for brief periods.


## Variants


### Night wyvern

>  Covered in dark blue scales to provide camouflage, **night wyverns** are a more powerful nocturnal variant of the standard wyvern. However, such wyverns are inhibited in strong sunlight. This variant definitely exists in [[Varisia]] in the area of the [[Iron Peaks]] and the [[Wyvern Mountains]].


## On Golarion

>  Wyverns inhabit places across the [[Inner Sea region]], ranging from the half-frozen [[Antler Rock]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] of northern [[Avistan]] all the way down to [[Dahak's Teeth]] in [[The Shackles]] where [[Aashaq's wyverns]] terrorise the people of [[Garund]], and east to the [[Tors of Levenies]] in the [[Stolen Lands]].
>  Several prominent locales across the Inner Sea region are named after the ferocious beasts, most notably the Wyvern Mountains atop the [[Storval Plateau]] in [[Varisia]] and the [[Orc]] city of [[Wyvernsting]] where beastmasters of [[Wingripper tribe]] soar on their semi-tamed wyverns above the city.
