> **Cave giants** are a race of cave-dwelling and [[Darklands|Darklands-dwelling]] [[Giant|giants]] who resemble a cross between [[Ogre|ogres]] and very feral [[Orc|orcs]]. Relatively unintelligent and technologically backward, any [[Metal|metal]] objects or [[Weapon|weapons]] they possess are stolen from their defeated foes.



## Appearance

> Cave giants appear as oversized [[Humanoid|humanoids]] with large tusks growing out of the back of their lower jaws. They share features of both orcs and ogres, but are bigger on average than both, standing over 10 feet in height, and weighing upwards of 1,000 pounds. Their true height is hard to judge, as cave giants walk with a perpetual stoop, most likely due to their overdeveloped musculature and their need to constantly crouch in cramped tunnels. Their arms are quite long, most likely due to their hunched posture. Their skin tones range from slate gray to a dark mossy green, and their dark hair runs from their head down their backs like a mane. They most often wear hides decorated with bone.


## Ecology

> Cave giants who live below ground are hunter-gatherers who collect [[Plant|plants]] and hunt [[Animal|animals]]. They are known to be particularly fond of [[Kobold|kobold]] eggs, and because of this are mortal enemies of the diminutive reptilian humanoids. Most cave giants could live to be over 100, but rarely make it past 60 due to their violent nature.


## Society & Culture

> Cave giants are violent raiders who manufacture few goods, preferring to steal them from others. They are particularly fond of and skilled at wielding [[Axe|axes]], and take them off other giants at any opportunity. They take their foes as [[Slavery|slaves]] whenever they can remember to not give into their bloodlust and kill all who stand before them. Those who are captured rarely live long, and end up being either fatally mistreated, or else being eaten when the giants run out of other food; this means that there is high turnover among the cave giants' slave population. Most slaves are either [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]] or orcs, with [[Dwarf|dwarven]] slaves being particularly valued due to their metalworking abilities.
> Like many giants, cave giants carry a bag containing some of their most prized possessions.
> Cave giants keep all manner of giant lizards as both guards and sport, although they prefer the less dangerous [[Giant monitor lizard|giant monitor lizards]] to the more dangerous [[Giant frilled lizard|giant frilled lizards]]. These creatures are trained in the most brutal manner possible and, because of this, will turn on their masters at the first sign of weakness. They are generally fed live victims (often slaves), with the ensuing slaughter being a source of great amusement and gambling for the cave giants.


### Religion

> The few cave giants who bother with religion are worshipers of [[Rovagug]], honoring him as the lord of earthquakes and [[Volcanic|volcanic]] eruptions. Some of his more ambitious followers have even concocted plans to free him from his prison so that he might blot out the hated [[Sun|sun]] but so far have failed.


## Cave giants in Golarion

> Cave giants are known to inhabit the [[Darklands of Tian Xia]], particularly the tunnels beneath the [[Wall of Heaven Mountains]]. In the [[Inner Sea region]], they are known to inhabit the caverns below [[Hollow Mountain]] in [[Varisia]] where they and their [[Ogrekin|ogrekin]] allies are active [[Slavery|slavers]]. They have also been spotted in deep sea caves in the [[Shackles]], living in a dangerous part of [[Cheliax|Cheliaxs]] [[Whisperwood]] caves known as the [[Scar Thicket]], and in caverns below the [[Kodar Mountains|Kodar]], [[Mindspin Mountains|Mindspin]], and [[Tusk Mountains]]; they are particularly common in the [[Hold of Belkzen]] where these three mountain ranges intersect.
