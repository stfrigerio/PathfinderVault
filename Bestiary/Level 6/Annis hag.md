Unlike a normal [[Grapple]], the annis hag doesn't need to be within reach and can move as she pleases, and a successful attempt lasts until the creature escapes (DC 24), causing the cage to crumble into rust.

> The **annis hag** is the most physically powerful of the [[Hag|hags]]. Sometimes known as **iron hags** or **black hags**, they are usually solitary but sometimes gather together in covens of three hags (of any type). They delight in torture and slaughter, and have a particular taste for the flesh of young children and the pure in heart.



## Appearance

> In its natural form, an annis hag is tall and hunchbacked, with blue or black skin and powerful claws. A typical specimen is over eight feet in height and weighs 300 pounds.


## Abilities

> Annis hags can alter their appearance in order to lure victims to their doom, and can also create clouds of fog. Unlike smaller hags, who tend to rely on guile or supernatural abilities, annis hags are dangerous melee combatants. Their strength causes their teeth and claws to inflict terrible wounds, and their tough skin is resistant to both sharp objects and [[Magic|magic]].


## Ecology


### Changelings

> [[Changeling]] children born to annis hags are known as **annis-born changelings** or **slag mays**. They are the strongest of the hag heritages, with powerful shoulders and strong frames, but tend to be the least [[Magic|magically]] inclined. Slag mays often have a strong zest for experiencing the new, relish grueling, physical tasks, and enjoy collecting trinkets or mementos.


## On Golarion

> [[Ulla Jarnrygg]] is a powerful annis hag [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]] who lives in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. The island of [[Three Hags Rock]] in the [[Ironbound Archipelago]] is said to be the grave of three annis hags so ugly that the moon goddess [[Desna]] built the island's mountains over their bodies so she would never have to look upon them again.
