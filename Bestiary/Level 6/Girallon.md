> **Girallons** are large, unintelligent, jungle dwelling carnivores, that resemble four-armed, white, giant [[Ape|gorillas]], but with a far more savage and bloodthirsty disposition.



## Appearance

> Girallons look very similar to giant gorillas with a few notable differences: the first is their size and stature, adults are typically eight feet tall and weigh eight hundred pounds making them far larger and heavier than the average gorilla. The second equally obvious difference is that they have an additional set of arms growing from their torso giving them added dexterity. These additional arms also allow the [[Ape|apes]] to literally tear creatures limb from limb.


## Habitat and ecology

> Girallons normally live in warm forests and jungles, most famously the [[Mwangi Expanse]] in [[Garund]] but they are also common on the [[Mediogalti]]. When in the wild they typically live in small groups led by a dominant male though young males often wander by themselves before establishing these small groups. Whether in groups or alone, girallons are highly territorial attacking intruders on sight. Girallons are also found in many large cities as they are favoured beasts in [[Golarion|Golarions]] many gladiatorial arenas, their habit of tearing their victims limb from limb makes them popular with the bloodthirsty crowds.
> Girallons are associated with the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Angazhan]] even though, since they are of [[Animal|animal]] intelligence, they are presumably incapable of worshipping him. Part of this association may come from the Angazhan-worshipping city of [[Usaro]] where the world's largest concentration of girallons is found. The myth of the girallons' creation adds to this association for it is said that once they were [[Human|humans]] who called upon savage [[Demon|demon]] gods of the jungle (most likely Angazhan) to grant them great strength. The demons granted them strength but with each generation the humans grew more feral.


## On distant worlds

> Girallons are fairly common on the red planet of [[Akiton]]. Their four-armed body structure (which resembles that of the native [[Shobhad]]) is enough to let some speculate that girallons originated on this planet.


## Angazhani

> Rumour claims that intelligent girallons still exist. The [[Angazhani]], or High Girallons, are larger than standard girallons, reaching nine feet in height and often weighing a thousand pounds. The High Girallons are also smarter, leading large packs of regular girallons in raids and in worship of Angazhan for as well as being smarter, they are far more evil.
