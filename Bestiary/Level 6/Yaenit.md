> A **yaenit** [[Demon|demon]] appears to have the head of a [[Hyena|hyena]]. They weigh about 300 pounds and have an average height of six-and-a-half feet.
> They are assigned to protect [[Lamashtu]]'s priestesses and their spawn. Their [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]]-like appearance indicates that gnoll [[Soul|souls]] make up a large part of the [[Evil|evil]] tormentors whose spirits form into yaenits. Gnolls worship yaenits as the embodiment of Lamashtu's will and as a goal to reach for.
