> This article might have further canon details available on **[[httpsstarfinderwikicomMi-go|StarfinderWiki]]**.


> **Mi-go** are interplanetary travelers native to the [[Dark Tapestry]] who manipulate reality. They resemble insects but are actually highly evolved [[Fungus|fungi]].



## Appearance

> A mi-go resembles an arthropod with segmented limbs, diaphanous wings, and a bulbous lump for a head. A typical mi-go is [[Human|human]]-sized and weighs 90 pounds.


## Ecology

> Mi-go communicate by clicking their pincers and changing the colour of their heads; this sign language can be learnt but usually not 'spoken' by other creatures. A mi-go can speak in a strange, buzzing voice, but only when forced to do so. Mi-go do not need to breathe and can fly through outer space at an incredible speed. Their claws are capable of swiftly and painfully performing [[Surgery|surgical operations]] upon hapless victims.


## Society

> Mi-go invade and colonise [[Planet|planets]] for various purposes, from strip-mining them to seeking resources for [[Scientific|scientific]] experiments. They are usually viewed as [[Deity|gods]] or [[Demon|demons]] by the primitive inhabitants of these planets, a fear that they exploit to the fullest to disguise themselves and infiltrate and harvest these societies. They usually hide their core bases of operations in remote, defensible places.
> Mi-go [[Technology|technology]] merges [[Magic|magic]] and technology in strange and unsettling ways. Most mi-go worship [[Shub-Niggurath]], seeing her fecundity as the pinnacle of their own biological technologies and skills. To a mi-go, [[Science|science]] and faith are largely the same.


## On Golarion

> The Uskheart Caves of [[Nidal]] are home to a mi-go colony that has long been allied to the [[Shades of the Uskwood]]. In exchange for permission to mine resources rare on their world, the mi-go whisper blasphemous secrets to the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]], the latest of which is the location of a [[Hive queen|hive queen]] in the [[Uskwood]].
