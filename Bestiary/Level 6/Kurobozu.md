![[Falehetu.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Falehetu, a kurobozu.


## Appearance

> Despite its significant physical power, a kurobozu resembles a grey-skinned emaciated monk whose mouth is a distended, hollow pit of darkness.


## Ecology

> Kurobozus have to feed on the breath of [[Mortal|mortals]], usually by sneaking up on a sleeping victim or more rarely by stunning enemies in combat. This is not immediately fatal, but spreads the contagious black apoxia [[Disease|disease]], which leaves behind an horrific rotting scent and leads to faintness, exhaustion, and death.
> Kurobozus hunt monks, especially former colleagues, out of jealousy. They partially retain their discipline, which they use to formulate long-term plans of revenge. They go out of their way to secretly assist malcontent ex-monks, revealing their identity to, and forging alliances with, those seeking to destroy their former masters and disciples.
