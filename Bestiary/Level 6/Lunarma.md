> **Lunarmas** are a race of alien [[Sorted Traits/creature/aberration|aberrations]] associated with the [[Dominion of the Black]].


## Appearance

> A lunarma is a flying crablike creature with three snapping tentacles and an acidic breath weapon. It is nearly five feet across and weighs 400 pounds.


## Ecology

> Lunarmas can eat flesh, wood, bone, and certain kinds of mineral. Highly aggressive, they drop on prey from above, grab them with tentacles and incapacitate them with their breath weapon. Due to its efficient digestion, a single lunarma can destroy a village in a few days. Lunarmas lay their eggs in living creatures: the eggs hatch after 24 hours, and the larvae begin to feed on the host before crawling out after a day or two.
> A lunarma larva forms a cocoon where it metamorphoses into a dormant juvenile, emerging when it senses food. It can remain in its cocoon for centuries, and clusters of cocoons have been found in sealed icy caverns, on cold [[Moon|moons]] and drifting [[Asteroid|asteroids]]. Once it matures, the lunarma only has a year to live, during which it seeks to reproduce.
> Lunarmas communicate with each other via [[Telepathy|telepathy]]. They are relatively unintelligent, lack a culture, and have no desires other than feeding and procreation. They have an instinctual hatred of [[Flumph|flumphs]], nemeses of the Dominion of the Black, and attack them on sight.
