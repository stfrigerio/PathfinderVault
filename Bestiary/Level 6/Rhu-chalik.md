> **Rhu-chaliks**, also called **void wanderers**, are enigmatic minions of the [[Dominion of the Black]] that seek out and feed on sentient thought. They can exist comfortably in the void of space, have lifetimes longer that the [[Star|stars]] themselves, and can transmit thoughts across the cosmos to the dark masters, making them the perfect scouts.
> A single unblinking, pupil-less eye bulges from their black, ovoid bodies, which are typically 3 feet long and composed of about 30 pounds of spongy tissue. From this central mass hang four tendrils coated in a [[Toxin|toxic]] enzyme capable of inflicting excruciating pain. Rhu-chaliks are incredibly deft telepaths, capable of reading thoughts, manipulating memories, and using a target's own fears to shred their sanity. They are even able to duplicate entire minds for transmission back to their Dominion masters.
> Scholars suggest that rhu-chaliks did not evolve organically but were selectively bred to suit the exact specifications of their role within the Dominion of the Black.
