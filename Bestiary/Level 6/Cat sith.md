> **Cat siths** are peculiar [[Magical beast|magical beasts]] that resemble stocky [[Cat|housecats]] about two feet long, with black coats and a white spot on their chests. They are sometimes taken as [[Familiar|familiars]] by [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]].



## Abilities

> Cat siths are capable of walking bipedally, unlike true cats, and of wearing articles of clothing such as boots. They can hold objects when standing up, but their paws do not possess the dexterity needed to operate complex items such as [[Wand|wands]] or [[Weapon|weapons]].
> Cat siths possess [[Magic|magical]] powers similar to those of the [[Fey|fey]], including the ability to remove the luck of other beings and to fool others into thinking they have been [[Curse|cursed]]. This has led to numerous superstitions forming around cat siths, such as the belief that they can steal the [[Soul|souls]] of the deceased and prevent them from journeying to the afterlife.


## Ecology and society

> Cat siths live in highland areas in proximity of established settlements. They are known to use their resemblance to common cats to enter towns and cities, either to spy for [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]], or for their own purposes.
