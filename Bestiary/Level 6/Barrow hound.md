> **Barrow hounds** are native to the [[First World]]. These hounds have dark-green fur braided into complex patterns that shift and reform on their own. These large creatures stand 7 feet high, are 14 feet long, and weigh nearly 3,000 pounds.
> The barrow hounds are unusually obedient for [[Fey|fey]]; they are loyal to those they respect. While they generally prefer to avoid battle by scaring creatures off with their ear-splitting howls, barrow hounds have a powerful bite and their braided fur is used to grab and constrict their foes.
> Barrow hounds are most often encountered in the [[Evergrove]] forest in the First World, but may be summoned on rare occasions by powerful fey or [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]].
