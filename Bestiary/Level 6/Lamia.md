> **Lamias** are the weakest of a family of creatures known as [[Lamyros|lamyros]], of which the [[Kuchrima|kuchrimas]], [[Lamia matriarch|lamia matriarchs]], and [[Harridan|harridans]] are also members. They appear as attractive, slender women from the waist up, with the lower body of [[Lion|lions]].


## Lamias on Golarion

> Like their more powerful kin, lamias are most frequently encountered in [[Varisia]] and the [[Hold of Belkzen]], due to the race's ancient ties to the lost realm of [[Thassilon]]. They are found in smaller numbers throughout the [[Inner Sea region]]. In distant [[Tian Xia]], they can be found in [[Shaguang]], in the dangerous areas closest to the impenetrable [[Wall of Heaven|Wall of Heaven Mountains]].
