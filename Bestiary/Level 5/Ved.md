> **Veds** are brutish [[Giant|giants]] of questionable intelligence, brought to [[Irrisen]] by [[Baba Yaga]] to help her during the [[Winter War]]. After the end of the invasion, they settled in the hills and mountains of southern Irrisen, where they occasionally launch small raids against local communities.
