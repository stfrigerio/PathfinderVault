> This article might have further canon details available on **[[httpsstarfinderwikicomDjinni|StarfinderWiki]]**.


> The **djinn** (pronounced JIHN; singular *djinni*) are [[Genie|genies]] from the [[Plane of Air|Elemental Plane of Air]].



## Appearance

![[Djinni_from_Diamond_in_the_Rough.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A classic djinni.
> A djinni is about 10Â½ feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds. Its lower torso trails away into a misty vortex.


## Ecology

> Djinn are said to be made of the stuff of clouds and possess the strength of storms. They can procreate with [[Human|humans]], producing [[Sylph|sylph]] offspring.


### Noble djinn or viziers

> About one per cent of the total djinn population are classed as **noble djinn**, who are often called **viziers**. A noble djinni can grant three *wishes* to any non-genie being who captures it. Noble djinn perform no other services and, upon granting the third *wish*, are free of their servitude. Noble djinn are stronger than normal djinn, typically as as strong as an [[Efreeti|efreeti]]. Their wishes are often granted in a flashy way, to the detriment of quality.


## Society

> Djinn are carefree, scholarly, mercantile beings, who welcome new experiences and enjoy learning from others. Despite their openness, like all genies, djinn are quick to patronise non-genies and remind others that they are the masters of the Plane of Air since time immemorial, which has earned them a reputation of being insufferable. Their sprawling libraries and museums are full of knowledge and treasure from the entire [[Great Beyond]], but the condescending djinn only allow their kind and [[Geniekin|geniekin]] open access to the libraries without having to contribute something.
> Djinn can communicate in [[Common]] and all of the elemental [[Language|languages]]â€”[[Aquan]], [[Auran]], [[Ignan]], and [[Terran]]. Additionally, they can communicate using [[Telepathy|telepathy]].
> The djinn's leader is [[Zafer XXXVIII|Sultan Zafer XXXVIII]], who rules over his empire from the [[Sussurran Palace]] in [[Armun Kelisk]]. The empire is divided into regions, each led by a noble djinni, titled sheikh, who rules from their capital city.
> Djinn are usually friendly with [[Marid|marids]], [[Janni|jann]], and many of the Plane of Air's natives. They often come to blows with [[Shaitan|shaitans]], whom they consider overly stiff, and are arch-enemies of [[Efreeti|efreet]]. The conflict between djinn and efreet is legendary, and it is possible to earn a djinni's service by promising to fight efreet.
> Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their [[Magic|magical]] powers and aerial abilities against foes. A djinni overmatched in combat usually takes flight and becomes a whirlwind to harass those who follow.
> Some speculate that the mysterious [[Metal|metal]] spheres scattered across the Plane of Air are the prisons or remnants of some long-defeated foe. The djinn refuse to acknowledge these rumours or touch these spheres.
