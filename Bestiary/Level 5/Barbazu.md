> **Barbazus**, or **bearded devils**, serve as [[Hell|Hells]] elite shock troops, leading hordes of the damned into combat for their [[Infernal|infernal]] masters.



## History

> The first barbazus were created by the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Barbatos]]. When Barbatos first arrived at the gates of Hell following the death of [[Typhon]], the original ruler of [[Avernus]], he brought with him an entire world's worth of [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Soul|souls]]. As a gift to [[Asmodeus]], Barbatos transfigured these damned souls into the first barbazu. This so impressed Asmodeus that he named the Bearded Lord the new gatekeeper of the Pit. Since then, the semi-living plane of Hell has learned to create barbazus of its own accord, and barbazus now count among the most common infernal denizens.


## Appearance

> Barbazus are roughly [[Humanoid|humanoid]] in appearance, although they would never be able to pass for [[Human|human]]. Designed for battle, barbazus are heavily built and strong, fighting in a stooped position bowed under the weight of their own muscles. They are six feet tall when standing up straight, but appear shorter because of their stance. Barbazus are covered in thick scales that provide protection equivalent to heavy [[Armour|armour]], helping them survive Hell's battlefields. This thick armour means they weigh upwards of 200 pounds.
> A barbazu's most famous feature is the beard for which they are named, made of sharpened, dirt-encrusted tendrils that twitch and move of their own accord. Barbazus often grab an opponent, pull them in close, then flay them with its sharpened beard. Practically all barbazus also wield serrated glaives; this vicious-looking [[Weapon|weapon]] allows them to reach opponents from behind their own troops.


## Habitat and ecology

![[Devil_battle.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Seelah]] battles barbazus in [[Hell]].
> Barbazus can be found anywhere battle is drawn in Hell, most commonly the plane's first layer of Avernus. Their trademark glaives are kept in infernal armouries in [[Erebus]], and they often train in Erebus's darkened vaults. Vast armies of barbazus can be found endlessly training throughout the bolgias of [[Malebolge]].
> Barbazus are often found serving spellcasters and worshippers of Asmodeus on the [[Material Plane]], where they are ruthlessly effective soldiers. Spellcasters normally offer a bound and helpless captive for a barbazu to slaughter during their [[Magic/Conjuration|summoning]], as it makes the barbazu more likely to comply. Barbazus all pay some respect to Barbatos, the mysterious archdevil of Avernus and their creator.
> Barbazus are normally created from [[Lemure|lemures]] in an agonizing process. The prospective barbazu is impaled alive on a spiked glaive and left there for decades. The transformation is complete when the [[Devil|devil]] finally has the strength, will, and self-control to pull itself free of the glaive.


## Abilities

> Barbazus have fewer [[Magic|magical]] abilities than most devils, relying on their brute strength in combat. Like most devils, they are capable of [[Teleportation|teleportation]] and summoning either a single barbazu or up to six lemures at a time. In addition to inflicting vicious wounds, their lashing beards also spread a disease known as [[Diseases of GolarionDevil Chills|devil chills]]. Finally, when wielded in their hands, their wicked glaives inflict terrible bleeding wounds that are particularly difficult to staunch.
