> **Skavelings** are giant [[Undead|undead]] [[Mobat|mobats]] created by the [[Urdefhan|urdefhan]] to serve as mounts or even as [[Animal companion|animal companions]]; sometimes they are called **ghoul bats**.



## Appearance

> Since they were originally mobats, a typical specimen has a wingspan of fifteen feet and would have weighed two hundred and fifty pounds when it was alive. However, they are easily distinguishable from living mobats by their rotting flesh and glowing green eyes.


## Creation

> Skavelings are a creation of the fiendishly [[Evil|evil]] urdefhans. Living mobats are raised on a special diet of fungus and [[Humanoid|humanoid]] flesh. The living creature is trained to serve the urdefhans. At the appropriate time, the creature is killed using a [[Necromancy|necromantic]] [[Poison|poison]] that causes it to rise as a [[Ghoul|ghoulish]] undead [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bat]] that remains loyal to its earlier training. The new undead is actually more intelligent than the original creature, becoming slightly brighter than the average [[Orc|orc]].


## Abilities

> The skaveling retains the mobat's ability to temporarily stun foes with its screech; urdefhans are immune to this stunning. It also gains the ghoulish ability to paralyse its foes with its bite. Its bite can also transmit the dreaded [[Diseases of GolarionGhoul fever|ghoul fever]].
