> **Achaierai** are flightless, bird-like monstrosities native to the burning plains of [[Hell]]. Although not [[Devil|devils]] themselves, they are evil, intelligent scavengers who pick over the battlefields of Hell, a practice that has given them their nickname: **Hell's vultures**.


## Achaierai on Golarion

> Being native to the [[Great Beyond]], achaierai are quite rare on [[Golarion]], but are sometimes summoned or called by evil spellcasters to serve as guards.
