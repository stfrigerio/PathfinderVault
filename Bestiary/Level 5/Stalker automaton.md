> **Stalker automatons** are the unparalleled assassins and scouts among [[Automaton|automatons]]. Most are built in a [[Cat|feline]] frame capable of blending seamlessly into its surroundings.



## Appearance

![[Alkenstar_gunfight.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Stalker automatons pursue a [[Gunslinger|gunslinger]] in [[Alkenstar City]].
> While made of [[Metal|metal]], a stalker's *automaton core* can use [[Illusion|illusion]] and [[Transmutation|transmutation]] [[Magic|magics]] to transform not only its coloration but also its texture. For instance, a stalker can form illusory plant growth to better blend in to a natural environment. Most are five feet long and weigh 300 pounds, but particularly old stalkers remember [[Bear|bear]]- and [[Drake|drake]]-sized models.


## History

> The Artificer Conclave built upon the predatory strengths of large cats to further perfect their ability to stalk and kill prey. These gifts attracted the [[Jistka Imperium]]'s greatest hunters to take on its form. While initially deployed against the Imperium's foes, the hunters within grew bored and began stalking prey across the [[Inner Sea region]], then the [[Material Plane]], and eventually into the [[Great Beyond]].


## Abilities

> In addition to its adaptive camouflage, stalkers can phase across [[Plane|planar]] boundaries to traverse Material Plane distances seemingly instantaneously, though this falls short of true [[Planar travel|planar travel]]. While formidable, they are especially patient and tactically adept, willing to retreat when overwhelmed and sometimes satisfied with simply going unnoticed in the presence of especially powerful quarry.


## Society

> Stalkers tend to hunt alone, but occasionally join with others to hunt as a pack of up to six close-knit members. Packs name themselves after their greatest successes, such as Titan Slayers. These groups lack a hierarchy and are guided only by the next hunt, regardless of which member locates it.
> The pack known as Those That Sought the Beast is said to have gained a [[Divine magic|divine spark]] of its own, and have begun pursuing [[Spawn of Rovagug]] as their great hunt.


## On Golarion

> Few stalkers remain on the Material Plane, particularly around Jistkan ruins, and pursue *automaton cores*, whose rarity makes them worth the hunt. Some also guard Jistkan ruins from intruders or those still infected by the [[Night Plague]].


## In the Great Beyond

> Stalkers who settle in [[Axis]] tend toward a more peaceful existence, either learning from [[Inevitable|inevitables]] and [[Axiomite|axiomites]] or serving as guides and hunting teachers.


## Known stalkers

> - Mulvara the Quarry-bound, who in legend consumes the [[Quintessence|quintessence]] of [[Outsider|outsider]] quarries and gains unknown powers as a result
