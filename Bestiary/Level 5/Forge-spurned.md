> **Forge-spurned** are [[Cursed|cursed]], fiery [[Undead|undead]] [[Dwarf|dwarves]], doomed to stalk the living in order to gather new [[Soul|souls]] for their [[Deity|god]] [[Droskar]], for having failed to meet his standards in life.


## Appearance

> Forge-spurned resemble hulking dwarves wrapped in heavy steel chains. Their faces, hands, and bodies are riddled with glowing hot hooks and half-melted razor wire. Black smoke rises from their smoldering beards, framing a freakishly contorted face covered in ash and soot. The tormented beings heft black [[Iron|iron]] [[Hammer|hammers]] in both hands, and the chains that drape their forms possess the malevolent life of angry [[Metal|metal]] [[Serpent|serpents]].
