## Appearance

> A hive warrior is [[Humanoid|humanoid]] in shape, covered with chitinous plating. Its head is elongated; it has a long, bladed tail, and its rending mandibles can spit acid.


## Ecology

> Hive warriors search for suitable hosts for the hive, sometimes ranging miles from their colony to drag victims back. Hive warriors consider symbiosis with a hive creature to be both inevitable and beneficial and can never fathom why most victims struggle against it. Most victims of [[Hive larva|hive larva]] infestation become hive warriors, though mutations can create hive creatures that retain the capabilities of the original creatures.
