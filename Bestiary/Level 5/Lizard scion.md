> **Lizard scions** are [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] of remarkable size, strength, and lifespan that are born within lizardfolk societies every few generations. They are thought by their people to be throwbacks to an era when lizardfolk were greater in power and ruled the world, and they almost always rise to positions of leadership within lizardfolk society.


## Appearance and ecology

> Lizard scions appear much like regular lizardfolk in most respects, but stand ten feet tall and are highly muscular. They also live longer than their smaller kin, typically reaching twice the lifespan of other lizardfolk.


## Society

> Lizard scions are officially recognized as such by other lizardfolk on their one-hundredth birthdayâ€”although their nature may become evident before thenâ€”in a ceremony in which they are awarded special [[Trident|tridents]] that only they are permitted to use; these [[Weapon|weapons]] may go unused for generations between the death of one lizard scion and the birth of her successor. Lizard scions usually take important roles in their tribes, and may become martial champions of their people if they are being forced into conflict with others at the time of the lizard scion's birth.
