> Servants of divine [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|goodness]], **buraqs** are wise, benevolent creatures that serve as either advisers or in some cases mounts for the virtuous.


## Appearance

> The buraq is a large [[Magical beast|magical beast]] with the body of a shining, pure white [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]]. What denotes its [[Magic|magical]] nature is its [[Human|human]] head, normally richly adorned with [[Gold|golden]] jewelry that sits atop it equine neck. Buraq faces differ based on gender the same way a human face does, with males preferring big, black beards and females favouring veils. Buraqs also have beautiful rainbow-colored wings that can dazzle the minds of those who look upon them, and tails of rich [[Peacock|peacock]] feathers. They are slightly smaller than the similar [[Pegasus|pegasus]] as they are only five feet at the shoulder.


## Habitat & Ecology

> Buraqs dwell atop mountains in warm environments, normally within deserts, and those seeking their advice are often forced to climb these mountains as a test. From their mountainous homes, they soar high in the sky and are able to call down lightning from the hot desert sky to strike their foes. Buraqs normally live alone, even when they have chosen a lifelong mate they still live separately, only rarely visiting each other. They are long-lived creatures with most reaching two hundred years old but some are reputed to be as old as five hundred. The only exception to their solitary nature is when one has given birth and then the family stays together until the child is five and strong enough to look after itself. On rare occasions, a group of up to four buraqs will come together to form a group called a "wisdom" to decide how best to deal with a mutual threat or problem.
> The buraq is related to the [[Lammasu|lammasu]] and is similarly known for its wisdom. As creatures of goodness, buraqs happily share their wisdom with any goodly creature who seeks it and they are renowned for their kindly charitable nature. Sometimes buraqs even agree to serve as a mount, but only for a person who is a paragon of goodness. Even then, they are normally required to complete some sort of holy quest. The most holy buraqs devote themselves entirely to the [[Upper Planes]] of [[Elysium]], [[Heaven]], and [[Nirvana]]. These buraqs have coats of pure [[Silver|silver]], hair of shimmering gold, and the ability to travel between the [[Plane|planes]]. Like a [[Genie|genie]], a buraq can magically create food and water, they can also travel great distances in an instant, and can exhale gusts of wind so powerful they can be used as a [[Weapon|weapon]].
