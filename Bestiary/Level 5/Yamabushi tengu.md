*For another meaning of "yamabushi", please see [[Yamabushi|yamabushi]].*
> Unlike [[Mortal|mortal]], flightless, feathered [[Humanoid|humanoid]] [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengus]], **yamabushi tengus** are winged avian [[Oni|oni]] who can shift at will between feathered and featherless forms.


## Appearance

> Yamabushi tengus have natural [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird-like]] humanoid form derived from tengus, with the feathers and features of any bill-less bird (though most take crow or [[Raven|raven]] shapes), and naturally average 5 feet in height and weigh 120 pounds. They can also take the form of other humanoid races, though they retain their wings and have unusually large noses.


## Culture

> These oni are driven to covet shiny treasures, clothing, and [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]], and often associate with thieves' guilds. 
> Other avian humanoids, such as [[Dire corby|dire corbies]] and [[Garuda|garudas]], fascinate yamabushi tengus. Ducks, geese, and other billed avian [[Animal|animals]], on the other hand, irrationally enrage them to the point that a yamabushi tengu will leave itself vulnerable to an enemy in order to kill a duck in its presence.
