> The **yetis**, or **abominable snowmen**, are the mysterious and terrifying inhabitants of the roof of [[Golarion]]. Found in small tribes in the highest peaks, these creatures are naturally stealthy and immensely strong, and are largely believed to be mythological creatures.

## On Golarion

> Yetis are known to live in numerous mountain ranges throughout [[Avistan]], including the [[World's Edge Mountains|Worlds Edge Mountains]], home to a monastery of reclusive yeti [[Monk|monks]], and the [[Kodar Mountains]] of [[Irrisen]], where a yeti tribe has been aiding in the escape of prisoners from the mine of [[Hope Lost]]. Yetis are also reported to live in the icy [[Crown of the World]] and in the [[Wall of Heaven]] mountains of [[Tian Xia]]. In the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]] many yetis have been drawn to the [[Psychic|psychic]] emanations of the meditating [[Garuda|garuda]] [[Monk|monk]] [[Mahadev]] near the peak of [[Gyanpad]] in the [[Lohaparbat Mountains]].
