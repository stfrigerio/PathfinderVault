> **Azlanti chariot beetles** were once proud warbeasts of the [[Azlant|Azlanti empire]], but now are little more than [[Vermin|vermin]] retaining almost none of their former abilities.



## Appearance

> An Azlanti chariot beetle is a huge [[Beetle|beetle]] easily capable of crushing a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Humanoid|humanoid]] in their mandibles. Its vast carapace covers its back and shimmers in a [[Hypnotism|hypnotic]] manner.


## Habitat and ecology

> Azlanti chariot beetles inhabit only the ruins of ancient Azlant. Some strange force compels them to find the remains of their former masters and protect them from intruders. This is perhaps what prevented them from losing all of their magical abilities. They seldom move far from these places of power.


## Abilities

> The beetle can dazzle the minds of those who look at it by using its shimmering carapace. However, this capability is weak compared to its powers at the height of the Azlanti empire, when it could rain [[Arcane|arcane]] fire on the empire's enemies while protecting the beetle from their magic, leaving nothing but ash in their wake.


## History

> Serving as part of the Azlanti army, these huge beetles flew through the skies in packs capable of blotting out the [[Sun|sun]]. They also served as the mounts for [[Wizard|wizards]].
