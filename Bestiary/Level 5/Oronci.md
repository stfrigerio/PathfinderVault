> **Oronci** is the name given to [[Orc|orcs]] who have undergone the terrible process of [[Drow|drow]] [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]]. They retain their orc upper torso, arms, and head, but their eyes have a dark, vacant look. The fleshwarping causes their legs to fuse, elongate, and grow dozens of small legs like a centipede, while their canines grow and connect to poison ducts.


## Habitat

> Oronci are created from orc slaves taken by the [[Mangled Limb tribe]] and gifted to the ancient orc [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemist]] [[Mother Chot]] in her laboratory-fortress of [[Dretha's Cradle|Drethas Cradle]] which is located in the [[Algid Wastes]] region of the [[Hold of Belkzen]].
