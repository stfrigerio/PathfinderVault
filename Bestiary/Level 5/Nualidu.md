> **Nualidus** are particularly capricious [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azatas]] strongly protective of water across the [[Multiverse|multiverse]].



## Appearance

> The lithe forms of nualidus are made out of churning water and draw down into long, [[Serpent|serpentine]] tails. This water starts off clear when the nualidu is created and darkens with age until it resembles the darkest oceanic trench, but always remains clean and fresh. A nualidu's hair and eyes range from sparkling blue to seafoam green, and always have the same colour. A typical nualidu stands a little over five feet tall and weighs 130 pounds.


## Ecology

> Nualidus form from the [[Soul|souls]] of [[Good|good]] aquatic races or good people who spent the majority of their lives near water. They retain hazy memories of sunsets upon the waves and familiar ports of call from their [[Mortal|mortal]] lives, and some nualidus spend their entire [[Immortal|immortal]] existence trying to seek them once more.
> Nualidus spring from the most [[Chaotic|chaotic]] bodies of water in [[Elysium]]. Their long tails and capricious personality resemble [[Protean|proteans]], and it is whispered that they are the offspring of some [[Protean lord|protean lord]].
> Nualidus constantly need to travel and rarely complete any but the simplest of tasks in an acceptable amount of time, but they have long memories and might return to finish the job many years later, even after everyone else involved has forgotten or died. In battle, they dance between opponents and terrain, shoving them across the battlefield and fleeing if they get bored.
> On the [[Material Plane]], nualidus are nomadic and travel natural bodies of water, experiencing the extremes of the natural world. They only tolerate artificial canals, which are often polluted by their own creators. If the source of pollution is apparent, the nualidu often tries to solve the problem without taking into account what the locals want, but the issue is often endemic to civilisation and no nualidu has the patience to change a society.


## Society

> Nualidus are community-oriented and form small pods of like-minded individuals. The membership of these pods fluctuate constantly as some leave and others join, but together they are as protective as a [[Human|human]] family.
> Nualidus relish courtly titles and often invent grandiose ones that often reflect (and exaggerate) their accomplishments. Throughout the years, they accumulate a long list of titles but eventually grow bored of them and discard them. The more bombastic and flamboyant a title, the longer it holds a nualidu's interest. A nualidu's titles might be both masculine and feminine, as their attitudes toward gender are as fluid.
> Nualidus despise anything they see as a perversion of water, especially [[Coffee|coffee]], [[Tea|tea]], and [[Alcohol|alcohol]], and look down on those who drink them. When offered these drinks, a nualidu might start to rant about how it has harmed mortals, going so far as to seek out a brewery or winery to destroy. This attitude rarely extends to naturally derived fluids.
> When [[Summoned|summoned]] by mortal [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]], nualidus prefer tasks that contribute to the protection or cleaning of water, and generally accept payment with stones eroded by water into unique shapes. They also demand their callers to treat them with respect and memorise some of their titles.
> Many proteans consider nualidus distant kin, while others see them as a mockery of proteans' ideally chaotic forms.
