> **Andrazku** are relatively weak [[Demon|demons]] that are inhabitants of the colder [[Abyssal realm|Abyssal realms]]. Born trackers, they appear somewhat similar to blue-colored gorillas.



## Associated Sin

> Misogyny that lead to the oppression and suffering of women. 


## Appearance

> Andrazku look almost like blue-furred gorillas with several noticeable differences. From their head sprouts a set of curving horns and a darker mane of fur on their necks, while their mouths sport a set of small but ferocious, shark-like teeth. Their legs are [[Satyr|satyr-like]] and end in cloven hooves. They walk with a hunched over gait that somewhat conceals that they are over 7 foot tall at the shoulder.


## Habitat & Ecology

> Demons of cold, andrazku prefer cold climates; on the [[Abyss]] they are associated with colder realms, particularly [[Kostchtchie]]'s realm of [[Jhuvumirak]]. When on the [[Material Plane]] they lair in cold locations, preferable ice or snow caves although their ability to swim and climb means these caves can be very difficult to reach.
> Andrazku are formed from the souls of misogynists who were also, essentially cowards, who used what little power that was granted them to abuse any women they could but never progressed to more serious crimes. Their cowardly nature makes them somewhat of a laughing stock amongst demon kind and they are particularly looked down on by [[Babau|babaus]] and [[Incubus|incubi]]. As they posses no mortal hungers to sate when hunting, andrazku prefer to savage, beat and berate their prey some times attack and injuring their prey only to let them go so they can hunt again. While they normally fight without weapons they have been known to wield swords and whips in imitation of the more powerful [[Balor|balors]] and even brand any creature they call slave. When summoned they like gifts of weapons and excessive flattery about their size and power but are much less likely to serve a female summoner.


## Society

> As one of the weaker demons they are often used by more powerful demons as either trackers or jailers. When left to themselves andrazku will often form gangs or packs to compensate for their relative weakness. They despise serving under more powerful female demons, particularly [[Marilith|mariliths]] and [[Succubus|succubi]], with a lone succubus they will sometimes try to gang up on them to tear them to pieces. Female demons are normally aware of this attitude and some delight in tormenting them specifically.
