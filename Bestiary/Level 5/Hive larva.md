## Appearance

> A hive larva is a writhing, maggot-like creature that secretes a caustic odour.


## Ecology

> Swarms of hive larvae incapacitate potential hosts with their [[Venom|venom]] and infest their bodies. During the first 24 hours of [[Diseases of Golarion|infection]], the host is unconscious as the larvae gestate and try to achieve symbiosis. Less than a day after symbiosis, the larvae mature, and the host slowly dies in pain as a hive creature explodes from within the body. This creature is usually a [[Hive warrior|hive warrior]], but mutations can create hive creatures that retain the capabilities of the original creatures. Immature larvae are vulnerable to expulsion, but nothing short of a *miracle* or *wish* can remove mature larvae.
> In some cases, the body of the host metabolises the larvae and becomes more and more monstrous, like that of a hive creature, while the host gains a mental link with the hive before transforming themselves into a cocoon and dissolving into a new swarm of hive larvae. Those hosts who wish to cleanse themselves of hive corruption could resort to [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]], or seek out the help of the hive's original creators, the [[Anunnaki|anunnaki]].
