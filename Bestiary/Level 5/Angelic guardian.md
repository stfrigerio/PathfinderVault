> **Angelic guardians** are not true [[Angel|angels]], but simply metallic [[Construct|constructs]] fabricated in the [[Golemworks]] of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]].


## Appearance

> Angelic guardians are typically built as brass sculptures of angels with steel wings. The main thing that distinguishes them from more mundane statues is the glowing halo of fire that hovers above their head.


## Habitat & Ecology

> As constructs. angelic guardians posses no true ecology as they are forged in Magnimar's world famous Golemworks. These constructs are normally only found within Magnimar and are a sign of considerable prestige for the city's rich and powerful, and are most commonly seen in the [[Summit Magnimar district|the Summit]] district.
