> **Mercanes** are a race of [[Extraplanar|extraplanar]] merchants whose reach across [[Plane|planes]] is as broad as it is profitable.



## Appearance

> A mercane resembles a 10-foot-tall, blue-skinned [[Humanoid|humanoid]] with a many-eyed face and three-fingered hands. They weigh 500 pounds.


## History

> Little is known about mercane origins; their home plane is a mystery, their sustenance and reproductive practices are the subject of rumors, and ever-changing stories tell of their participation in a planar war with details about their role depending on the storyteller.


## Society

> Mercanes are interested only in [[Magic item|magic items]], for which they bargain aggressively but fairly, and are willing to hire [[Adventurer|adventurers]] in order to acquire specific items. They honor contracts as if they were hallowed documents.
> A mercane might choose to follow mercenaries capable of keeping them well paid in whatever [[Currency|currency]] they prefer. Mercanes are especially interested in the *planar alchemical catalyst* on the [[Plane of Earth]] for its value on other planes.


## Possessions

> Each possesses an [[Extradimensional|extradimensional]] *chest of the mercane* that allows them to buy and sell magic items regardless of the locale. To protect their wares, many mercanes maintain an entourage of bodyguards and carry large masterwork [[Falchion|falchions]].


## On Golarion

> Mercanes occasionally wander as merchants on the [[Material Plane]], including on [[Golarion]].


## In the Great Beyond

> Half a million mercanes live in [[Aktun]], capital of [[Axis]]. Mercanes arrived mysteriously in Axis aeons ago to set up trade routes to an unknownâ€”and perhaps lostâ€”planar location.
> Mercanes are among the smallest minority groups in [[Shadow Absalom]]. A small population of about 500 mercanes lives in [[Yulgamot]], the [[Planetoid|planetoid]] metropolis of the [[Astral Plane]]. Mercanes also join other travelers in [[Heaven's Shore|Heavens Shore]] on the edge of [[Heaven]], roam the cities of [[Hell]], and set up shop in [[Alushinyrra]]â€”wherever goods can be hawked across the planes, mercanes are likely there.
