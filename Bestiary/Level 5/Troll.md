![[Troll_duel.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Sajan]] sparring with a troll in a monastery.
>  A **troll** is a monstrous [[Giant]] with a rough, green hide, clawed hands, and a bestial face with a hideous, tusked underbite. These fearsome monsters regenerate all damage not inflicted through fire or acid, and a full-sized troll can regrow from even a tiny scrap of flesh. [[Scrags]] are a variety of aquatic troll that typically dwell in cold northern rivers and lakes.



## Appearance

>  Male trolls typically stand 8 feet tall and weigh 300 pounds. Females are larger, weighing up to 500 pounds and sometimes reaching heights of 10 to 12 feet. Trolls have a hunched posture that can make them appear shorter than they actually are. Their skin is usually green, with females having darker shades than males.


## Ecology

>  The young are raised by the females, who drive away adult males (as the males would otherwise eat their own young). The females live in family groups, casting out or killing (typically by drowning or starvation) any members who show weakness. The males live as solitary hunters, preferring to lair in caves or dark woods.


## Society

>  Trolls believe they were created by the [[Demon lord]] [[Urxehl]], who loves to test them by inflicting upon them incursions of ogres and [[humans]], storms and (worst of all) forest fires. Urxehl sometimes grants his followers the power of [[Magic/Divination]]; such trolls are known as [[augurs]], and predict the future by ripping out their own entrails and reading omens from them. Augurs are known to operate in [[Kaer Maga]], and the Vile Fortress in eastern [[Vudra]]. Trolls are known to sometimes keep [[winter wolves]] as much-abused pets, relying on trollish regeneration to survive the wolves' sharp fangs and freezing breath.


### Trolls on Golarion

>  Trolls are commonly encountered in the wilder areas throughout the [[Inner Sea region]], but are particularly common in northern [[Avistan]]. The [[River Kingdoms]], the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], and [[Numeria]] specifically have long-standing issues with trolls. In the realm of [[Irrisen]], trolls are often part of the general population, and [[ice trolls]] are employed as guards in the city of [[Whitethrone]]. The largest tribe of trolls in [[Golarion]] lives in southern Vudra. They are known as the Mistshaper trolls, and are ruled by a massive female called Xelnud. She considers herself to be Urxehl's agent, and seeks to restore Golarion to the "perfect" condition of the [[Age of Darkness]].


## Troll variants

>  Variations include the [[alchemically]] enhanced [[rock troll]], which comes to a halt in sunlight (and may even turn to stone given sufficient exposure), and the thin, [[Plant]]-like [[Moss troll]]. There are also blue-skinned ice trolls serving [[Baba Yaga]] in Irrisen.
>  Unlike most trolls, [[mountain trolls]] are associated with the [[First World]] and not inherently [[Evil]]. They are huge and more powerful variants that tend to live in cold mountainous regions.
>  Others are the smaller [[Sewer troll]], [[Flood troll]], and [[Chimney troll]]; the gigantic many-headed [[Jotund troll]]; the aquatic [[Scrag]]; the [[Ettin]]-like [[Two-headed troll]]; and the [[Ogre]]-troll hybrid known as the [[Troggle]].
