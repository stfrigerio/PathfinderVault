> **Cloud dragons** are [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/dragon|dragons]] native to the Elemental [[Plane of Air]]. They are one example of the [[Extraplanar|extraplanar]] [[True dragon|true dragons]] known as [[Primal dragon|primal dragons]].



## Abilities

> As with all true dragons, cloud dragons gain in power as they age. They have formidable physical abilities, and as they age they gain [[Spell|spell-like]] abilities and [[Sorcerer|sorcerous]] spellcasting. They can also see through mist and clouds with ease.
> Adult cloud dragons can transform themselves into a cloudy vapour, with no reduction to their flying speed. The thunderous clash of a very old cloud dragon's teeth can cause sonic damage to those it bites, in addition to the normal bite damage.
> Cloud dragons can breathe a line of electricity.


## Appearance

 A group of cloud dragons.
> Cloud dragons have distinctive four-horned heads and short snouts. Their bodies appear to exude wisps of smoke.


## Habitat and society

> Cloud dragons are driven by their whims, and are especially driven by curiosity. They wander through the skies of their home plane, and often wander away from it and into the [[Material Plane]]. Often, the cloud dragons found on [[Golarion]] traveled there for some specific purpose but found its skies and mountains hospitable, decided to stay and eventually forgot the goal that originally drove them there.
> Cloud dragons are solitary creatures. They have no interest in politics or intrigue, preferring to travel as the urge takes them. They enjoy meeting new creatures and, like many other dragons, gaining new treasures from them. They lair in high places, returning from time to time to deposit their latest acquisitions.


## History

> The Plane of Air was once thought to not be home to any dragons other than immigrant [[White dragon|white]] and [[Silver dragon|silver dragons]]. This belief was eventually proven wrong by the discovery of cloud dragons.
