> A **dimorphodon** is a member of the [[Pterosaur|pterosaur]] family, a group of winged reptiles distantly related to [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaurs]].
> They have large heads, and two rows of teeth. The front row are large and are used for holding prey and injecting [[Poisons of Golarion|poison]]. The second row are smaller and are used to tear flesh.
> The creature's appearance leads to its nickname of the **fangbird** or **vampire lizard**. However, they are not actually blood drinkers, usually feeding on fish, reptiles, and birds. There are also tales of dimorphodons gathering in flocks of up to nine creatures in order to bring down larger prey. In those cases poison their victim with their bites, then back off while it dies.
> Dimorphodons are valued as exotic pets or guard [[Animal|animals]], as they are particularly easy to train.
