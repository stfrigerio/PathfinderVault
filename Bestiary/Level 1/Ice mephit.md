> **Ice mephits** are diminutive [[Humanoid|humanoid]] [[Mephit|mephits]] native to colder sections of the [[Plane of Air]].



## Appearance

> Ice mephits appear like small humanoids with leather wings that stretch between their arms and their diminutive bodies. Their skins is normally light blue in colour and they often have icicles hanging off of them.


## Ecology & Society

> Ice mephits are most commonly found on the Elemental Plane of Air where they most often serve as servants and assistants for more powerful [[Elemental|elemental]] creatures. They are able to breath cones of ice that sicken mortals that are caught in them.


## In the Great Beyond

> Ice mephits can be found flitting around many of the settlements of the Plane of Air like [[Armun Kelisk]] and Port Eclipse. Many however choose to remain independent of the more powerful elementals that dominate such metropolises and instead dwell in their own small nations and kingdoms centred around the small pockets of solid matter that dot the Plane of Air. The most notorious of these kingdoms in the [[Hautansia|Sparkling Principality of Hautansia]], ruled over by the small yet sadistic ice mephit [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]] known as [[Eshakhar I|His Frozen Majesty King Eshakhar I]].
