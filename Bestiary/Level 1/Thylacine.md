> **Thylacines** are [[Wolf|wolf-]] or [[Hyena|hyena-like]] marsupial carnivores. Feral and untameable, thylacines can be vicious predators.



## Appearance

> Though similar in appearance to [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|dogs]] or wolves, a thylacine is much more slenderly built, with a long, stiff tail, and powerful jaws. The oddly-shaped legs of a thylacine are ill-suited to running, but allow the creatures to stand on their haunches for short periods of time, as well as conferring some jumping ability. Thylacines typically have between 13 and 21 dark stripes on their backs that stand out from their usually golden-colored pelts.


## Ecology

> Thylacines hunt alone or in small packs, slowly wearing down their prey over long chases. They are timid creatures when faced with larger foes and prefer to avoid fights, though when faced with starvation they have been known to take down much larger prey, including humanoids. Most thylacines (excepting the [[Tian Xia]] blood cougar) are almost impossible to tame. The creatures lair in small dens in trees or caves.
> Unlike most marsupials, both male and female thylacines have pouches, though the male's is used only to protect its genitals. Females give birth to litters of up to ten joeys, though less than half usually live to adulthood. A thylacine has a lifespan of four to ten years.


## Variants

 Brush thylacine
This generally larger and more powerful breed of thylacine resides in more wooded environments than its smaller kin.
 Blood cougar
More powerful than the ordinary hill thylacine, these red-pelted marsupials are native to [[Tian Xia]]. More easily domesticated than their western relatives, they are are often kept as pets by powerful leaders of the [[Tian human ethnicity|Tian-La]].
 Casmar thylacine
In [[Casmaron]], thylacines only grow as large as the juveniles of the ordinary hills thylacine. However, they form much larger packs.
 Sarusan wolf
Rather than the somewhat feline appearance of many other thylacines, the [[Sarusan]] wolf has an unmistakably wolfish maw. Although they have less stamina than other thylacines, they have a more wicked bite.
