> The **pseudodragon** is a miniature cousin of a [[True dragon|true dragon]] whose bodies rarely grow to more than a foot in length. Their tails are tipped with a sharp barb, through which they can deliver a powerful soporific [[Poisons of Golarion|poison]].


## House drakes of Korvosa

> The flying, purple creatures who make their homes in the the rooftops of [[Korvosa]] are actually not pseudodragons at all, but a local sub-species known as [[House drake|house drakes]]. They are in constant conflict with the large number of [[Imp|imps]] brought to the city by the [[Summoner|summoners]] of the [[Acadamae]]. Many of Korvosa's nobles decorate their roofs with tiny amounts of precious metals, among them [[Silver|silver-lined]] weather vanes, shingles, and gutters designed to catch the sunlight to give their homes a distinctive sparkle in the sunlight. By spending years sharpening stings and teeth against these silver-enhanced decorations, or sneaking drinks of [[Holy water|holy water]] from outdoor fonts at various temples, some house drakes have effectively transformed themselves into deadly weapons against the city's imps.
