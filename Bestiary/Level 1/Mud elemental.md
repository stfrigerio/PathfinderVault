> **Mud elementals** are [[Elemental|elementals]] made of mud of various densities. They form in the borderlands between the [[Plane of Earth]] and [[Plane of Water]], and are scorned by both [[Earth elemental|earth elementals]] and [[Water elemental|water elementals]]. Large and powerful mud elementals tend to resemble worms, reptiles or [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Frog|frogs]].
