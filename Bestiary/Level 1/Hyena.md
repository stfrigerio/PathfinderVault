> **Hyenas**, or **hyaenas**, are [[Cat|cat-like]] mammals, though with many [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|canine]] elements, that have shaggy fur and are known for their cunning hunting tactics and vocalizations that sound eerily [[Human|human-like]]. They largely eat carrion, but will occasionally supplement their diet with fresh meat should the opportunity present itself. They are the [[Sacred animal|sacred animals]] of the [[Infernal duke|infernal duke]] [[Ruzel]].


## Ecology

> Hyenas often hunt alone, but when in packs, will send a few members toward their prey while the rest circle around to attack from behind.
> Savage [[Humanoid|humanoids]], especially [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]], will train hyenas to serve as vicious guards, often outfitting them with [[Barding|leather barding]].


## Similar species

> Gnolls strongly resemble bipedal, [[Humanoid|humanoid]] hyenas, and believe themselves to be descended from hyenas granted sapience by [[Lamashtu]]. [[Yaenit|Yaenits]], a race of [[Demon|demons]] that serve Lamashtu, also have the heads of hyenas.
> A particularly large and primeval variety of hyena is known as the [[Hyaenodon|hyaenodon]].
