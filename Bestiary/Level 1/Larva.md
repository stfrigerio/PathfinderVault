> **Larvae**, sometimes denoted more specifically as **Abyssal larvae** or as **soul larvae**, are the hideous [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] of the [[Abyss]]. A larva is a pale, maggot-like creature about 1â€“3 feet in length, whose facial features are similar to those of the living being it once was. They bite anything that bothers them. Larvae that spend long enough eating the filth of the Abyss transform into [[Demon|demons]]. They are hunted, however, as larvae may be used in vile [[Magic|magic]] or eaten as a tasty morsel; fiends and [[Night hag|night hags]] value larvae enough that a form of [[Currency|currency]] has evolved where larvae are used in transactions and barter.
