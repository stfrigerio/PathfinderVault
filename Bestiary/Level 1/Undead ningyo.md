> One of the most bizarre oddities found on [[Golarion]] is the [[Ningyo|ningyo]].  Described by many as a half-simian/half-fish type of mer-creature, these diminutive creatures inhabit the tropical coasts of [[Garund]].  What makes them even stranger, is that they seemingly refuse to die.  If a ningyo is killed, it rises as an undead creature the following night.  At dawn, the animating force fueling its unnatural life disappates, and the ningyo simply becomes a corpse again.  Only the complete destruction of the body halts this nightly resurrection, something which knowledgeable folk are quick to do if they come across a dead ningyo during daylight hours.
