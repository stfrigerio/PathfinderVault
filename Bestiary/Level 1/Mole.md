> The **mole** is a tiny, brown, apparently eyeless rodent mammal that has a furry cylindrical body, a pointed snout, and large thick paws that end in digging claws. A typical mole is 6 inches long and weighs less than a pound. Moles live in burrows underground, have poor eyesight, and can dig long distances.
