> **Lightning elementals** are [[Elemental|elementals]] made of dark storm clouds of various shapes. The air around a lightning elemental hums and throbs with the sound of electrocution and the smell of ozone. In battle, they are aggressive to the point of suicidal, and especially enjoy attacking creatures made of metal or use metal equipment.
