> **Rabbits** are small burrowing mammals with short tails, long ears, and powerful hind legs that allow them to quickly avoid predators. An average rabbit is between eight to 20 inches long and weighs between one and four pounds. Rabbits are sometimes taken as [[Familiar|familiars]], and are the favored animals of the [[Deity|goddess]] [[Shelyn]].
