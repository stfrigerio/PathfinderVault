> **Silvanshees**, or **cat agathions**, are a race of diminutive [[Agathion|agathions]] who are hardly distinguishable from a normal [[Cat|house cat]]. They act as [[Nirvana|Nirvanas]] eyes and ears on the [[Material Plane|mortal plane]], and are sometimes taken as [[Familiar|familiars]] by [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]], or are [[Summon|summoned]] by benevolent [[Arcanist|arcanists]] (especially by [[Aasimar's Mercy|aasimars]]).
