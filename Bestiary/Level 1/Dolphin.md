> **Dolphin** is the name given to a family of aquatic mammals that hunt socially in shallow seas and rivers and gather in groups called pods. Many sailors are fond of dolphins and tell stories of being saved from drowning by them, or saved from [[Shark|shark]] attacks. Dolphins are sometimes taken as [[Animal companion|animal companions]] by maritime [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] or [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]].


## Dolphin species

> Numerous species of dolphin with unique characteristics and habitats exist. The [[Embaral Ocean]] is home to gray dolphins with blue-pink sides that are believed to be sacred to [[Hei Feng]], and which sailors thus avoid harming. [[Orca|Orcas]] are the largest species on dolphin known, and are further distinguished from other dolphins by their black-and-white colorations. [[Popoto|Popotos]] are the smallest dolphins known to exist, and are occasionally encountered in freshwater.
