> **Penguins** are flightless [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]] notable for their black-and-white colouration and their waddling gaits. They feed on [[Fish|fish]] and krill, and are preyed upon by [[Polar bear|polar bears]], [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]] and especially leopard seals. On snow- or ice-covered terrain, a penguin can slide on its belly to move faster.
