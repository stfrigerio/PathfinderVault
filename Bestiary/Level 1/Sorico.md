> **Soricos**, also called **dustshroud rabbits**, are an alien species of [[Animal|animal]] from the distant desert [[Planet|planet]] [[Kasath]]. They were brought to [[Golarion]] on the [[Spaceship|spaceship]] *[[Destiny]]*, and while most of the specimens on the ship died in its [[Rain of Stars|crash]] thousands of years ago, a few survived and have established a small colony in [[Numeria]].


## Appearance

> A sorico has strong forearms and claws designed for digging, and tawny fur caked with sand and mud from their tunneling. They resemble large [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Level 1/Rabbit|rabbits]] and are three feet long, two feet tall, and weigh about 100 pounds.


## Ecology

> Up to three dozen soricos nest in tunneled warrens that they communally dig, similar to [[Ant|ants]]. When threatened, they can shake the dust and mud from their fur coats to create a dense, distracting cloud.
> Soricos can be trained, and are considered delicious game with a flavor similar to farm-raised rabbit.
