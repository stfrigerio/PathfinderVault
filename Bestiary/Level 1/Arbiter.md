>  **Arbiters** are [[inevitables]] who serve as scouts, diplomats, and intermediaries between [[aeons]] and [[mortals]].



## Appearance

>  An arbiter resembles enscribed bands of bronze or copper forming a metallic spheres, with a single eye, two arms and two wings that do not fully join to its body, and clawed hands. They sometimes wield a [[magical]] [[shortsword]] in one of these hands.


## Abilities

>  An arbiter can always sense the direction, if not the distance away, of the nearest non-arbiter inevitable on the [[plane]]. It can fly, which is as much a supernatural ability as a physical one. Its most powerful [[weapon]], the ability to release their internal energy as a deadly burst of divine magical electricity, is reserved for times of dire need since it disables the arbiter for 24 hours. They are also limited [[spellcasters]] of [[Divine magic]] who can gain limited foresight, [[compel action]], detect chaotic beings and energies, and repair objects.


## Ecology

>  Found throughout the [[multiverse]] in courts and on battlefields, arbiters keep a close eye on the forces of [[chaos]] and do their best to direct individuals to the [[lawful]] cause. Arbiters see themselves as advisers and counsellors who guide their [[summoners]] on the path of law.
An arbiter who comes across evidence of a significant insurgence of chaos does everything possible to rally its allies against it. If it cannot handle the situation, the arbiter either insists on being helped to reach the nearest greater inevitable, or on returning to [[Axis]] to report.
>  Since the aeons' Convergence, many arbiters have also become intermediaries for aeon machinations with their mortal associates.
