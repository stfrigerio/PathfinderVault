> A **rhamphorhynchus** is the smallest-known species of [[Pterosaur|pterosaur]], a family a [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaur]]-like reptiles often found in the vicinity of true dinosaurs.  
> They have a five-foot wingspan, a mouth full of needle-sharp teeth, and a long tail that ends in a wicked barb. Males have bright scalesâ€”typically red, blue or green, sometimes with stripesâ€”whilst females have more neutral colours.
> They are typically found in flocks of up to 16 creatures. Their small size and swift speed makes them hard to hit. They attack by swooping down on their prey, but are too small to be a threat to most [[Humanoid|humanoids]].
