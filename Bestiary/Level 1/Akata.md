    desc: "  After 3 or more days without eating, an akata can secrete resin that encases it in a noqual cocoon. The cocoon has Hardness 9, 40 HP, and a Broken Threshold of 18. It has resistance 5 to damage from magical sources. As long as the cocoon remains intact, the akata can't be harmed, and it doesn't need to eat or drink. While inside the cocoon, the akata gains lifesense 30 feet.

> This article might have further canon details available on **[[httpsstarfinderwikicomAkata|StarfinderWiki]]**.


> **Akatas** are terrifying, animalistic predators from the [[Dark Tapestry]] beyond [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Solar system|solar system]]. More terrifying than these predators' hunger is their horrific manner of reproduction, which could only come from a creature born far from the light of any [[Star|sun]].



## Description

> An akata is about the size of a [[Lion|lion]] with similar proportions, but it has two tentacular tails, and instead of a mane it boasts tendrils encircling its neck. Its flesh is rubbery, and it weighs around 400 pounds. Akatas lack lungs or vocal cords and are unable to make any sound; they make no sound when they move, no roars or braying even as they close in to tear prey limb from limb.


### Abilities

> An akata's abilities are alien in nature, and its void bite has no parallel in any natural creature of Golarion. An akata's bite can infect its victim with its own microscopic young as part of the akata's breeding cycle. Once inside the host, their young function like a debilitating [[Disease|disease]] referred to as void death and gradually kill their host. When the host creature dies, the strongest young akata latches onto a brain cell and re-energizes it, reanimating the creature as a reanimated host. It continues to grow until it forces its way out through the bottom jaw, creating what looks like a horribly oversized, swollen tongue. These host creatures are known as void zombies.


## Habitat and ecology

> An akata can wrap itself in a cocoon by excreting metallic fibers from its mouth and hibernate indefinitely. The cocoon protects it from fire and impact, making it suitable for its travels on [[Comet|comets]] through space. While cocooned, it can awaken when it senses nearby living creatures and heat sources.
> Akatas live wherever the [[Comet|comets]] carrying their cocoons land, and can be found throughout the [[Planet|planets]] of Golarion's solar system. They originated in the [[Asteroid|asteroid]] belt known as the [[Diaspora]], but also frequently appear on the nearby dead world of [[Eox]]. Akatas begin their life cycle in outer space, where they hibernate on comets and [[Meteor|meteors]] until they crash into a life-bearing planet. When active on a planet, akatas generally hunt in packs of up to thirty, with larger packs led by large akatas known as **akata princes**.
> Akata ecology is totally alien to Golarion. They communicate using both visual means and smell. They can survive without any sort of air, but are burned by salt water as if it were acid and can die if fully immersed in it.


## On Golarion

> Inscriptions in temples dating back to [[Earthfall]] depict akatas falling from the stars. Followers of [[Groetus]] have been known to summon akatas.
