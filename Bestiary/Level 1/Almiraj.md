> The **almiraj** is a small [[Magical beast|magical beast]] resembling a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Level 1/Rabbit|rabbit]] with a [[Unicorn|unicorn]]-like horn in the middle of its forehead. They are popular [[Familiar|familiars]] among [[Witch|witches]].



## Ecology

> Unlike true rabbits, almirajes are highly aggressive, territorial carnivores. They hunt by using their horn to gore their prey; however, since creatures killed by an almiraj's horn are immediately turned to stone, almirajes have to eat their prey while it is still alive.
> In addition to being found in the [[Material Plane]], almirajes also exist in the [[First World]].


## History

> It is thought that almirajes were created through [[Arcane|arcane]] means, due to the creatures' association with witches, their susceptibility to hexes and the [[Magic|magical]] properties of their horns. As such, it is possible that witches might have created the first almirajes as a deliberate attempt to produce a new type of familiar.
