> **Naiads** are [[Fey|fey]] who make their home in and protect freshwater areas, particularly rivers.



## Appearance

> Naiads are lithe and thin, and their skin appears to be made of water, and they have hair that flows like a river. They are elegant and attractive, with delicate builds that show their grace and dexterity. They tend to be of medium height, and tend to dress themselves in natural items such as leaves and reeds found near the bodies of water they are bonded to.


## Culture

> Naiads value their small communities, called currents, and tend to keep to themselves around water.


## Language

> Naiads speak [[Nonhuman languages of GolarionSylvan|Sylvan]] and [[Aquan]], but have learned to speak [[Common]] as well.
