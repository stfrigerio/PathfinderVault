> The flying, purple creatures who make their homes in the the rooftops of [[Korvosa]] are similar to [[Pseudodragon|pseudodragons]], but are actually a local sub-species known as **house drakes**. They are in constant conflict with the large number of [[Imp|imps]] brought to the city by the [[Summoner|summoners]] of the [[Acadamae]]. Many of Korvosa's nobles decorate their roofs with tiny amounts of precious metals, among them [[Silver|silver-lined]] weather vanes, shingles, and gutters designed to catch the [[Sun|sunlight]] to give their homes a distinctive sparkle in the sunlight. By spending years sharpening stings and teeth against these silver-enhanced decorations, or sneaking drinks of [[Holy water|holy water]] from outdoor fonts at various temples, some house drakes have effectively transformed themselves into deadly weapons against the city's imps.
