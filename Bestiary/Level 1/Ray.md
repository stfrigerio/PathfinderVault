> **Rays** are a type of [[Fish|fish]] distinguished by flattened bodies, sail-like fins, and long tails that give them a kite-like appearance.



## Ecology

> Rays are carnivorous fish. All species of ray possess a rudimentary sense of electrolocation, which can sense the electrical fields produced by other living creatures.


## Variants


### Blood rays

> **Blood rays** are ambush predators that inhabit swamps. They paralyze prey with their sting, and then drain their victims' blood.


### Leviathan rays

> **Leviathan rays** are immense deep-ocean predators capable of swallowing [[Ship|ships]] whole.


### Manta rays

> **Manta rays** are passive filter feeders found in the surface waters of temperate and tropical oceans, where they feed on plankton and small fish. They are often domesticated by [[Aquatic elf|aquatic elves]] and other water-dwelling cultures, who use them as messengers, beasts of burden, and pets. Manta rays are generally unsuitable as mounts, but can be used to pull carriages and carts. A [[Magic item|magic item]], known as a *cloak of the manta ray*, is named after this species due, in part, to the physical similarity between the ray and the cloak.


### Stingrays

> **[[Stingray|Stingrays]]** possess [[Poison|poisonous]] stingers in their tails, and normally live hidden in sediments at the bottom of seas and freshwater bodies.
