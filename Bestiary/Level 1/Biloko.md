> The **biloko** are bloodthirsty, blood-red [[Fey|fey]]. These [[Gnome|gnome-sized]] hunters stalk the wildest depths of southern [[Garund|Garunds]] warm jungles.



## Appearance

> While they are about the size of a [[Halfling|halfling]], a biloko could never be mistaken for one. While similar in frame, a biloko's skin is dark red in colour and covered in patches of moss and jungle foliage instead of hair. A biloko's eyes glow bright red with an unsettling manic glee, and its mouth can stretch into a hungry grin far larger than its face should allow. A biloko can even detach its jaw to eat like a snake and can even swallow a [[Human|human]] whole over the course of several hours, its acidic saliva and powerful jaws capable of grinding flesh and bone into a compact slurry.
> Biloko normally stand between three and four feet high and weigh between 40 and 50 pounds although after eating they can weigh much more; the outline of their last meal can often still be seen through their swollen belly.


## Habitat and ecology

> Biloko dwell primarily in the rainforests that cover much of the [[Mwangi Expanse]], though they usually stick to the deeper parts of the forest. They stay within reach of their favoured prey: foolish lone travellers. Despite their bright colour, biloko are natural predators adapt at blending in to their verdant jungle surroundings.
> Biloko often build small shelters for themselves in hollow trees near trails, and drape them in moss and vines to disguise them. Biloko hide in these shelters and wait for suitable prey to pass, then whistle a strange, alluring melody that slowly infiltrates the prey's mind and persuades it to wander alone into the jungle. Biloko often have many such shelters and can build a new one in less than a day.
> Biloko subsist entirely on [[Humanoid|humanoid]] flesh, which is what makes them such a popular staple of fearsome fireside myths. It is also what drives them into such close proximity to the Mwangi Expanse's human population. Thanks to their fey nature, biloko do not need to eat nearly as often as creatures of flesh and blood would, and can go weeks without feeding. However, the hunger slowly drives them mad, and in desperation they sometimes resort to cannibalism. 
> Biloko are related to the more civilised, but equally bloodthirsty, [[Spriggan|eloko]]. Despite their similarities, however, their is no love lost between the two species, with biloko often attacking the eloko like they would any other humanoid.


## Society

> While intelligent biloko are not very sociable and only form small groups, their attempts at society pale in comparison to the eloko's city of [[Elokolobha]]. When not using stealth to hunt, biloko often travel in small, vicious gangs that are not as hierarchical as a tribe. Due to their relatively static territories, they rarely encounter an unfamiliar biloko, although their numbers are great enough that they are a menace throughout much of the Expanse.
> When they do encounter newcomers, biloko regard them merely as rivals for their prey that must be tolerated. Apart from other biloko, they have no contact with other intelligent creatures except when they devour they prey. Biloko have no concept of wealth, although they do gather brightly coloured berries and fruit that appeal to their powerful vision. This fascination with bright colors also leads biloko to obsessively collect bright gems.
