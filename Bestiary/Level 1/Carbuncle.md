The real carbuncle transports to a clear space within 30 feet that it can see, and a hollow shell remains behind. The fake body appears solid until it is touched, at which point it crumbles to dust."

    desc: "â¬º ([[enchantment]], [[incapacitation]], [[mental]]); __Frequency__ three times per day  __Effect__  The carbuncle concentrates on a creature it can see and tries to manipulate that creature. The target must attempt a DC 18 Will save. The target then becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.\n__Critical Success__ The attempt backfires and bolsters the target's mind instead, granting it a +1 status bonus to Will saving throws for 1 hour.\n__Success__ The target briefly experiences an unusual but harmless sensation like an unexpected flavor or scent, an urge to eat something strange, or an amusing half-forgotten memory.\n__Failure__ The target is compelled to spend all of its actions on its next turn performing harmless, pointless, and usually embarrassing actions.\n__Critical Failure__ As failure, but the compulsion persists for 1 minute. The target can attempt a new save at the end of its turn each round to end the effect."

> A **carbuncle** is a strange, tiny, armored reptilian [[Magical beast|magical beast]] with a [[Gem|gemstone]] horn in the center of its forehead and strange [[Magic|magical]] powers.
> As the focus of intense rumor and legend, the hunt for a carbuncle's horn can be analogous to a snipe hunt. Carbuncles possess a simple form of empathy or [[Telepathy|telepathy]], and can attempt to impress its thoughts or will on nearby sentient creatures. [[Adventurer|Adventurers]] who confront the creatures are often amazed to see the carbuncle seemingly will itself dead, in which case the horn crumbles to dust and the carbuncle becomes an inert corpse that dissolves into a puddle of slime within hours. Although some legends hold that their gem-like horn is a fabulously valuable stone, it usually crumbles to dust when harvested.



## Appearance

> Carbuncles stand one foot high at the shoulder, stretch three feet long, and weigh 12 pounds. The horns of male carbuncles tend to have warmer colors, while those of females tend towards cooler tones.


## Habitat and ecology

> Carbuncles dwell in forests or swamps, where they are adept at hiding in the grass or undergrowth, in fruit orchards, or near berry bushes. Carbuncles are indifferent and apathetic creatures. Generally uninterested even in members of their own kind, they occasionally cluster in isolated areas where fruit is plentiful. Yet, they are clever enough to preserve themselves from danger by leading intruders into lethal situations while making their own escape.
> While shy, carbuncles are attracted to magic users and people carrying fresh fruit, and can be enticed into serving as a [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] [[Familiar|familiar]].


## On Golarion

> Carbuncles are known to live in the [[River Kingdoms]] as well as [[Brevoy]], including the [[Rostland Plains]]. They are also popular as familiars among [[Prophet of Kalistrade|Prophets of Kalistrade]] and in the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Kintargo]].
