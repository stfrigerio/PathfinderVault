*This article is about the domesticated [[Animal]]. For its wild relative, see [[Boar]]. For the tavern in [[Magnimar]], see [[Pig (tavern)]].*
>  **Pigs** are small, omnivorous, four-legged [[Animals]] often domesticated for their meat and hide, but are also clever, sociable, and trainable on their own. Some [[spellcasters]] even take pigs as [[familiars]], especially [[halflings]] and [[gnomes]] and spellcasters in [[Varisia]].
>  Large pigs are sometimes called **hogs**, female pigs **sows**, and infant pigs **piglets**. [[Boars]] are their wilder ancestors.



## Appearance

>  Pigs can vary greatly in size and color based on their breed and upbringing, and most weigh between 100 and 300 pounds. A typical pig has a large head, long burrowing snout, and four hoofed toes per foot. Male pigs have tusks for canine teeth.


## Abilities

>  Pigs are hardy animals, and wild pigs can survive in almost any conditions. They have an acute sense of smell and good vision in dim light.


## Ecology

>  In the wild, pigs might be found living alone, in pairs, or in herds of up to 12. Domestically, pig farmers manage eight or more pigs at a time. Pigs are known to squeal loudly when distressed.

### As food

>  Pigs are often bred for their meat (called **pork**) in temperate locations, with popular cuts including **bacon** and **ham**. [[Goblins]] are especially fond of pigs, who go beyond feasting on the animals to torture them, train them to be mounts, or use their fat to make **pig grease** to lubricate themselves out of trouble.
>  Eastern [[Cheliax]] is home to numerous pig farms, and simmered pork loin with sweet onions and apples is a popular regional dish. [[Orcs]] breed pigs and [[goats]] as domestic livestock, as do halflings, who also in rare instances use pigs as mounts to defend their farms.


### As weapons


>  [[Alchemists]] alter the decomposition of hog corpses to transform them into nauseating [[weapons]] when flung by [[siege engines]] such as trebuchets and catapults, or by particularly large creatures.



### In religion

>  Tales of [[Erastil's]] wrath claim that Old Deadeye turns disobedient, greedy worshipers into pigs if it makes them more useful to their community.


### In sport

>  [[Blood pig]] is a violent, physical sport popular in [[Old Korvosa]] wherein two unarmed teams of eight players earn points by snatching a live pig and throwing, punting, or dropping it into pits containing hungry [[wolverines]].
>  Some harvest [[festivals]], such as those in [[Ravenmoor]], include a competition where participants attempt to be the first to wrestle and pin down a greased pig.



## Variants

>  [[Moss pigs]] live in swamps, and have long strands of [[fungus]] and moss hanging from their sides and tusks and a mottled, hairy coat.
>  [[Sin seekers]] were once pigs but have been [[magically warped]] and extensively bred to become eyeless flying creatures that can compel honesty and smell [[morality]].
