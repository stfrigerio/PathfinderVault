> **Atomies** are diminutive [[Fey|fey]] resembling minuscule [[Humanoid|humanoid beings]] with pointed ears and delicate insectile wings. They possess courage and pride far beyond what might be suggested by their tiny frames, and are greatly attracted to heroism, daring fights, and dueling; few things please an atomie more than challenging and humbling a larger foe.


## Society and culture

> In fey society, atomies often serve as guards or sentries for larger fairies such as [[Bestiary/Nymph|nymphs]] and [[Dryad|dryads]], although they only possess a limited ability to effectively protect their larger and more powerful charges, and often abandon their duties out of boredom. They also share a good relationship with [[Grig|grigs]], and the two types of tiny fey often ally with each other for mutual aid and defense.


## On Golarion

> As fey, atomies are common on their home [[Plane|plane]]: the ancient [[First World]]. A group of [[Winter fey|winter-touched]] atomies has recently been brought to [[Taldor|Taldors]] [[Border Wood]] as part of a series of [[Magic|magically]]-cold weather patterns. They have also been spotted in the wilderness near the [[Brevoy|Brevic]] city of [[Silverhall]], as well as the fey-haunted [[Verduran Forest]].
