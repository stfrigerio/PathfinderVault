*See also: [[Shark]]*
> A **jigsaw shark** is an aquatic predator fairly common in the waters of southern [[Varisia]].  It gets its name from its distinctive jagged markings and is known for having a nasty temperament. Aggressive in the extreme, these [[Animal|animals]] are known to even attack potential food on land, launching themselves out of the water. Jigsaw sharks can survive in both saltwater and freshwater, and often swim up rivers in search for food, particularly into the shallow waters of the [[Mushfens]].
> Jigsaw sharks are generally at least 5â€“8 feet in length, although some have spotted specimens of up to 20 feet. They are hunted for their meat, with their fins being particularly valued for such dishes as jigsaw fin mahktasha.
> Additionally, jigsaw sharks live in the [[Fever Sea]] and the [[Inner Sea]].
