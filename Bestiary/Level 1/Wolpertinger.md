> **Wolpertingers** are peculiar creatures combining the characteristics of hare, deer, and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird]]. They are related to [[Skvader|skvaders]].



## Appearance

> Wolpertingers largely resemble common hares, but possess both feathered wings and deer-like antlers. Their fur color ranges from tan and light brown to nearly black, and is typically mottled. An adult wolpertinger is approximately two feet long, with a four-foot wingspan, and weighs fifteen pounds.


## Ecology

> Wolpertingers primarily inhabit temperate forests and forested hills, but scarcity of suitable habitat may drive them into colder and warmer climates. They rarely dig burrows, as their antlers make this difficult, and instead nest in secluded areas or in the former dens of larger [[Animal|animals]].
> Wolpertingers are omnivores, but prefer a meat-based diet. They typically hunt small prey such as mice, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Level 1/Rabbit|rabbits]], and squirrels, but will attack larger and predatory animals such as [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fox|foxes]]. Packs of wolpertingers have been known to successfully take down solitary [[Wolf|wolves]]. During a hunt, wolpertingers will adapt their tactics to the terrain. Generally, however, they tend to use horn-first charges when attacking from a distance and to flank prey in pairs. Older and stronger specimens tend to focus on protracted combat, while younger pack members utilize hit-and-run tactics.
> Wolpertingers live in packs, and are highly territorial. A pack will claim a suitable territory and patrol it extensively, collectively attacking any intruders until these are killed or driven off. This response extends to other packs of wolpertingers, although neighboring packs can coexist peacefully as long as their respective borders are not violated. Wolpertingers will occasionally form mixed packs with skvaders.
> Wolpertingers mate in the spring. Kits remain with their parents for a year, afterwards setting off to establish packs of their own.
