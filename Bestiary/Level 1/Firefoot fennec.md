> The **firefoot fennec** is a small [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fox|fox]] native to a small region around southern [[Isger]] and northern [[Cheliax]]. They earn their name from the fiery color of the fur around their paws, and they are often regarded as symbols of good luck by locals. [[Absalom|Absalomians]] and [[Molthune|Molthuni]] traders can earn a high price for their colorful pelts.
