> Rare, unnaturally large [[Bloodseeker|bloodseekers]]â€”commonly called stirgesâ€”known as **stirge hounds**, are often used as tracking [[Animal|animals]], as they are capable of following flying creatures through the [[Darklands]]. They are very aggressive and prone to hunting in packs or even swarms. A stirge hound's proboscis is uniformly ivory-colored, while its body is usually dark rust-red along the wings fading to black upon the main body.
