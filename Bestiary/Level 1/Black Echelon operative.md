> During a failed invasion of [[Absalom]] by the [[Taldor|Taldan empire]] called the [[Silent Tide]], operatives were sent into the city on missions of sabotage.  Before embarking, these operatives, knows at the [[Black Echelon]], swore an oath to complete their missions, no matter the hindrance.  Their plot was subsequently discovered and the members of the Black Echelon were hunted down and killed to the man.
