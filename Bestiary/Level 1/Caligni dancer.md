> **Caligni dancers**, or **dark dancers** as they are termed by non-caligni, act as a messengers, actors, entertainers, and story tellers between the different clans and factions of [[Caligni|caligni]]. They will spend time moving from one clan to another, spreading the history and stories. Their festive nature tends to be welcome by all caligni, who consider the death of a caligni dancer as an ill omen.



## Appearance

> Caligni dancers are small [[Halfling|halfling]]-sized [[Humanoid|humanoids]] and, like other caligni, they have pallid skin, white eyes, and an emaciated appearance. Caligni dancers dress in the rags, similar to other caligni, but tend to have more color and decoration in their appearance. Caligni dancers stand roughly four feet tall and weigh as little as 60 pounds.


## Abilities

> Caligni dancers are able to fortify the minds of their allies against mental attack or [[Illusion|illusion]] [[Magic|magic]]. Offensively, with a touch, a caligni dancer has the power to [[Curse|curse]] an enemy with clumsiness.


## Death

> As with all dying caligni, caligni dancers blast energy which, in their case, is a dazzling white light.
