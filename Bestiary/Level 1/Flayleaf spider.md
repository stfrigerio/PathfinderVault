> **Flayleaf spiders** get their names because they are found on the [[Flayleaf|flayleaf]] bush. One infested flayleaf bush could be home to thousands of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spiders]]. These spiders will aggressively attack those that threaten their homes. A single spider's [[Venom|venom]] is not very dangerous, but when an entire swarm is biting a victim, they can overcome [[Humanoid|humanoid]] and larger creatures. These spiders have red markings on their abdomens, while their head and thorax are longer than normal spiders.
> The venom from these spiders is harvested and sold as an inexpensive liquid poison, which weakens its target.
