> **Esipils** are [[Sahkil|sahkils]] that prey on the fear of [[Animal|animals]], making sure that the civilised world around them remembers that their domesticated animals are only one step away from wild ones.



## Appearance

> An esipil has a stout [[Canine|canine]] torso atop a slithering worm-like body. Lashing veins and viscera dangle from its face. An esipil stands one foot tall at the shoulder, and its body stretches nearly three feet long. It weighs around 13 pounds.


## Ecology

> Esipils like to fight nearly anything, and prefer savouring the fear of their opponent to watching them flee in terror. Esipils telepathically taunt opponents with vulgar, disconcerting mental taunts. Once they engage, they are resilient and dogged fighters. Although an esipil's ability to frighten its victims is potent, it only relies on it in desperation.


## Society

> Esipils ingratiate themselves into society by acting as unruly pets to [[Humanoid|humanoid]] masters, and delight in aggressive episodes, barking and snapping until called down. They return to a fawning obedience for a time, until the next inevitable outburst. Despite their belligerence, esipils actually enjoy serving powerful masters and take pride in their power.
