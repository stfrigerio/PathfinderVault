> **Fauns** are horned, hoofed [[Fey|fey]] strongly resembling [[Satyr|satyrs]].



## Appearance

> Fauns strongly resemble [[Humanoid|humanoids]], but with the horns, legs and tails of white-furred [[Goat|goats]]. They usually stand about six feet tall, and have pointed ears.


## Ecology and society

> Much like satyrs, fauns are known hedonists and enjoy good food, [[Alcohol|drink]], [[Music|music]], dancing, and carnal pleasure. They are benevolent beings despite the hedonism, and are known to form positive relationships with humanoid settlements that respect the land they live on, which they protect from threats, such as less peaceful fey beings.
> Fauns tend to find [[Bestiary/Nymph|nymphs]] even more attractive than other beings who view them, and often go to great lengths to impress them. The nymphs themselves tend to appreciate the fauns' goodness, lighthearted personalities and dedication to nature, and have been known to take them as lovers and companions.
> Fauns are a distinct species from satyrs, despite their physical similarity. Fauns are often the result of unions between satyrs and fey or humanoid women; while encounters between satyrs and women of other species often produce satyr children, encounters with particularly [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|virtuous]] mothers produce faun children instead. Unlike their satyr progenitors, fauns are not restricted to the male sex. While female fauns are less common than males, fauns of both genders are known to exist.
