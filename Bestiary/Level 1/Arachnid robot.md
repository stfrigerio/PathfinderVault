> **Arachnid robots**, also nicknamed **spiderbots** by [[Numeria|Numerias]] [[Kellid]] natives, are a type of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|dog]]-sized, [[Scorpion|scorpion]]-like [[Robot|robot]].


## Appearance

> Arachnid robots come equipped with a plasma welding torch that resembles a scorpion's tail. They can use their claws as an additional pair of limbs when climbing.


## Ecology

> Arachnid robots serve as sentinels, spies, and pets of Numerian [[Technologist|technologists]]. Under stress, an arachnid robot's plasma core can overload and explode in a fiery blast. Because of this, they have been used as suicide bombers, but arachnid robots have a sense of self-preservation and only do so when tricked. Due to their small size, they are the easiest robots to smuggle past [[Technic League]] agents outside Numeria.
