The gestalt has the base statistics of a legion archon (AC, saving throws, attacks, skills, Speeds, and so on) but the spells and special abilities of a lantern archon. Additionally, it has a ranged light ray [[Strike]] (+18 attack, Damage 3d4 (3d4) fire and 3d4 (3d4) good), and the bonus from its Lantern of Hope increases to +3. When the gestalt separates, its remaining Hit Points are divided evenly among the lantern archons, and if the gestalt had fewer than 9 HP, some of the lantern archons die."

> **Lantern archons** are small, zealous, evasive, and social [[Archon|archons]] who often serve as messengers and scouts for the forces of [[Heaven]].



## Appearance

> A lantern archon is a pale illuminated globe of pure spiritual energy. Its light can be any hue and ranges in brightness from a candle to a torch at will, but it cannot be extinguished completely until its death. Lantern archons in general enjoy modulating their light in time with [[Music|music]] or to amuse others.
> They make no sound as they glide gracefully through the air, and their voices are echoing and airy.


## Ecology

> Lantern archons are formed from shaped living light. Many serve as illumination fixtures in Heavenly settlements, simultaneously providing both light and surveillance.
> Lantern archons can be [[Summoned|summoned]] by [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]].


## Abilities

> Lantern archons can work well together in large numbers, and in desperation can form a gestalt being comprised of nine archons that is more powerful together than apart.
> Like other archons, lantern archons can [[Teleport|teleport]] at will and, in rare instances, [[Bastion archon|bastion archons]] form when a lantern archon gestalt and [[Shield archon|shield archon]] fuse while attempting to swap positions via teleportation.
