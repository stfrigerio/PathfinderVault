> **Shaukeens**, also called **tripurasuras** or **sly ones**, are the weakest of the [[Asura|asuras]], created by stronger asuras as blasphemous mockeries of the [[Deity|gods]] creations. They delight in causing the downfall of those who give them aid, particularly any who provide them schooling.


## Appearance

> In its true form, a shaukeen is a tiny creature in the shape of a muscled man with a crown of frilled horns and eyes that glow like [[Ruby|rubies]]. It can change shape to assume a pleasing or innocuous form, though this ability is limited and each individual shaukeen can only change shape to a single [[Humanoid|humanoid]] form.


## Ecology

> Unlike other asuras, shaukeens are not manifestations of divine mistakes; instead, they are created by the most powerful of asuras exhibiting their loathing of the gods. The most common reasons for their creation are either as raw materials for an [[Asurendra|asurendra]] sage to create more powerful asuras, or to recruit [[Mortal|mortals]] to the asura cause. A shaukeen's reincarnation depends on its deeds: successful ones earn the right to a permanent cycle of reincarnation as more powerful asuras, while unsuccessful ones are recycled as [[Quintessence|quintessence]] to create new shaukeens.
> A shaukeen wanders the world, seeking pious mortals to corrupt. When it encounters a promising [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]] (typically one who has some religious tie), the shaukeen presents itself as a curious student eager to learn. The shaukeen hides its true nature and power while seeking to steer its alleged master into acts that promote the collapse of religious institutions. When the 'master' falls victim to justice or revenge, the shaukeen fades away to watch before seeking a new victim.
> Some spellcasters seek out shaukeens to employ as [[Familiar|familiars]]. A shaukeen greatly values these opportunities, since it will never need to abandon the master and can continue to spread its agenda for their life.
