> **Mockingfey** are diminutive [[Fey|fey]], native to the [[First World]], but occasionally found on [[Golarion]]. In their original form they appear as parrots with brilliant plumage, [[Humanoid|humanoid]] heads with elongated ears, and two curling horns or antennae. They possess the [[Magic|magical]] ability to transform themselves into the likeness of any creature, although they always retain their small stature.
> Mockingfey are friendly and useful allies toward those who treat them well. Their insatiable curiosity makes them always well informed about their area. Their curiosity usually makes them among the first creatures to go through from the First World to the [[Material Plane]] every time a [[Planar rift|planar rift]] occurs. Colonies of mockingfey are found in [[Kyonin]], the [[River Kingdoms]], the [[Border Wood]] of [[Taldor]], and sylvan groves around the [[Inner Sea]].

#### Gathlains

> Mockingfey and [[Gathlain|gathlains]] get along very well together sharing a similar love for the same practical jokes and unsubtle comedy that quickly alienates both species from others' society.
