> **Goats** are hardy, nimble four-legged herd [[Animal|animals]]. They can be domesticated for milk, cheese, meat, fur, and hide, and can serve as pack animals or mounts for smaller races as well as [[Familiar|familiars]] for [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] and as [[Animal companion|animal companions]]. They have a reputation for being temperamental and stubborn.



## Appearance

> Goats can have a wide variety of appearances, but all have fur, horizontal slit-shaped pupils, cloven hooves, and four-chambered stomachs that allow them to eat and digest a vast variety of food. Many have at least two horns of varying shapes, as well as beards on their chins.
> Height and weight vary by breed; they can range in height from 16 inches to several feet and weigh from 45 to 300 pounds.


## Abilities

> Goats are nimble enough to scale nearly sheer walls in pursuit of food.


## On Golarion

> Varying adaptations in many goat breeds allow them to inhabit almost any environment. In the wild, herds of goats prefer edible grasses and roots in fields and plains. However, some goat breeds are especially well-adapted to mountains and cliffs, scaling steep inclines for sparse fibers and minerals. Wild goats are known to roam the [[Wyvern Mountains]] and [[Menador Mountains]], and live year-round in even the [[High Ice]] near [[Golarion|Golarions]] North Pole.
> They are raised as agricultural mainstays across Golarion, from the [[Zenj]] of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] to [[Carpenden]] in [[Andoran]], the [[Gronzi Forest]] of [[Brevoy]] to the [[Nesmian Plains]] of [[Nirmathas]], and even [[Erutaki]] villages like [[Iqaliat]] in the frigid [[Crown of the World]].
> They are also prey animals for mountainous [[Kuchrima|kuchrimas]].
