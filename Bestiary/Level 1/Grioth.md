> **Grioths** are an [[Evil|evil]] race who inhabit rogue [[Planet|planets]], worship [[Nyarlathotep]], and oppose the [[Dominion of the Black]].


## Appearance

> A grioth is a silent [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Level 1/Bat|batlike]] [[Humanoid|humanoid]] with a long, [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Rat|ratlike]] tail and four narrow eyes. Grioths are prone to mutations, caused by the eldritch forces of the [[Dark Tapestry]], into lumbering or deformed creatures.


## Ecology

> Grioths live in dark spire cities on rogue planets, ruled by their elders, and often travel to other worlds via [[Portal|portals]] during eclipses to pillage resources rare on their homeworlds. Grioths prefer [[Weapon|weapons]] made out of voidglass; and it is thanks to grioths that a small amount of voidglass has been transported to [[Golarion]]. Many grioths are known for their devotion to Nyarlathotep, whom they worship in his guise as the Haunter of the Dark. Elder grioths possess unusual [[Psychic|psychic]] powers, which aid them against the Dominion of the Black, their nemeses.
> Grioths speak a [[Grioth language|language]] consisting of squeaks, clicks and nonsensical animal noises. When speaking [[Language|other languages]], they do so with a raspy, dry voice.
