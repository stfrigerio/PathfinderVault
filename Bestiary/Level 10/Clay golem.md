> **Clay golems** are a type of golem created from soft clay, usually by powerful divine spellcasters. They are generally eight feet in height and six hundred pounds in weight. (To put that in context, the average [[Ogre|ogre]] is two feet taller but weighs only fifty pounds more.)



## Abilities

> The mindless clay golem is an uncomplicated opponent, and in combat attempts to batter its opponents into submission using its powerful fists. The wounds it causes are cursed. They do not heal naturally, and only the most experienced spellcasters are able to heal them via magical healing.
> Once per day, the normally lumbering golem can move at frightening speed for a short period.
> In common with most golems, they are immune to all but a handful of spellsâ€”typically those that affect earth. Acid attacks actually heal them.
> There is a flaw in the method of constructing clay golems; the elemental spirit that powers them is imperfectly bound. There are numerous tales of clay golems going berserk under stress, attacking the nearest creature or object regardless of any orders it may have. There is no known way of re-establishing control once a clay golem goes berserk


## Construction

> The golem's body is crafted from a single block of clay of at least 1,000 pounds in weight. Skill at either sculpture or pottery is required to create the final form, which is then treated with special oils and powders. Various spells are then cast to animate the golem; these spells are outside the scope of most arcane magicians, so clay golems are generally created by [[Cleric|clerics]].


## Variants


### Palanquin golem

> Palanquin golems, which were developed in [[Osirion]], lack the ability to increase their speed and are permanently attached to stone platforms that carry passengers. They are unable to fight, but there is no chance of them going berserk.


### Dero clay golem

> [[Dero|Deros]] have discovered how to create variant clay golems from the black sludge they remove from their mines at the bottom of the Makers' Mark, a great rift in the underground ruined city of [[Ilvarandin]].
