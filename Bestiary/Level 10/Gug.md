*For another meaning of "Gug", please see [[Gug language]].*
> Ancient and grotesque [[Giant|giants]] banished since time immemorial, the **gug** is as savage a foe as it is alien. Having been exiled beneath the earth for countless generations, the appearance and morphology of gugs marks them as clearly alien. Whatever they are, they clearly have no place on [[Golarion]]. This origin would be easier to overlook if it were not for the occasional sign of a far greater intelligence influencing the bestial gugs.



## Appearance

> Gugs at first glance resemble mangy, furred giants. However, even the briefest of glances reveals them to be far weirder than any sort of giant. Their most obvious difference is that they have four arms. Rather than four separate arms, gugs have their extra pair of arms growing out of what should be their elbows. Their eyes are pink, bloodshot, and are sheltered by unnatural bony protrusions. Instead of opening vertically, a gug's mouth opens horizontally across the top of the head, turning the gug's head into a single oversized abyss of teeth.


## Ecology

> Gugs are not native to Golarion, but came to this world ages ago from another reality tied to the [[Dimension of Dreams]]. They were lured here by the Rough Beast, [[Rovagug]], who called to them through a [[Magic|magical]] [[Portal|portal]] located in the [[Orv|Orvian]] [[Vaults|vault]] known as the [[Midnight Mountains]]. Once in this world, they fell under the [[Deity|gods]] influence and began to multiply.
> Their flexible body structure allows them to crawl through spaces far smaller than their appearance would suggest. Gugs are both carnivorous and ravenous, and though they favor the flesh of sentient creatures, gugs can also survive on the subterranean flora of their homes. They are one of the few creatures that find nourishment in [[Undead|undead]] flesh, although they have an inherent fear of [[Ghoul|ghouls]].


## Habitat and society

> Gugs live in the [[Darklands]] below Golarion's surface, particularly in [[Sekamina]], and speak a gurgling language known simply as [[Gug language|Gug]]. They normally dwell in small nomadic groups that wander the Darklands, hunting to feed their ravenous appetite. Occasionally gugs are found inhabiting huge underground cities that seem completely at odds with their bestial nature. There is no definite explanation for this behavior, and regardless of whomever built these cities, they belong to the gugs now.
> Numerous gugs live in the Scales district of [[Ilvarandin]], one of the vaults of Orv. They are sometimes taken as hosts by the [[Intellect devourer|intellect devourers]] of nearby [[High Ilvarandin]].


### Religion

> Gugs revere Rovagug above all other gods, although they also pay tribute to a number of bizarre deities of their own.


## On distant worlds

> Gugs have also been spotted on the remote [[Planet|planet]] of [[Aucturn]].


## *Gug hide*

***Main article: [[Gug hide]]***
> Their skin is sometimes used to make *[[Gug hide|gug hide]]* [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]], which allows its wearer to split their arms in two at the elbow to gain four hands for short span of time.


> [[Paizo Inc]] published a major article on gugs in *[[Darklands Revisited]]*.
