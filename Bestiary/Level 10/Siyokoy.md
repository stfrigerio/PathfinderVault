> **Siyokoys** are [[Eel|eel-like]] aquatic [[Sorted Traits/creature/aberration|aberrations]].



## Appearance

> A siyokoy has the face, tail, and scales of an [[Electric eel|electric eel]] and humanoid arms.


## Habitat and society

> Siyokoys interactions with others vary on their native depth. Shallow-water siyokoys socialize more with nearby races, including surface-dwellers, while deep-water siyokoys are more morose, or even aggressive. Members of surface races sometimes pay siyokoys for help finding shipwrecks and underwater ruins.
> As a race, siyokoys tend to ally with [[Cecaelia|cecaelias]] and [[Locathah|locathahs]] and oppose [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]], iku-tursos, and other [[Evil|evil]] aquatic creatures and societies.


## On Golarion

> Siyokoys live in the [[Embaral Ocean|Embaral]], [[Obari Ocean|Obari]], and [[Okaiyo Ocean|Okaiyo oceans]], and the [[Ivory Sea|Ivory]], [[Songil Sea|Songil]], and [[Valashmai Sea|Valashmai seas]]. A band of siyokoys lives in the ruins of Sangoshi off the coast of [[Minkai]] where they regularly attack trading vessels of the nearby city of [[Hiyosai]].
