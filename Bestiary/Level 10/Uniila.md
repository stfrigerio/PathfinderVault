> The **uniila**, also known as the **cabal [[Devil|devil]]**, is a [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiend]] who seeks to seduce mortals with the mysteries of [[Magic|magical]] power.


## Appearance

> An uniila appears as a floating, shrouded, lithe feminine figure darkly cloaked in glyph-decorated and tattered arcane robes. Four pallid arms reach from beneath the robes, clutching eldritch blades or implements.


## Habitat & Ecology

> Native to [[Stygia]], uniilas eagerly seek passage to the [[Material Plane]]. These fiends offer magical power to mortals in a seemingly neutral way that still tempts their victims to [[Damnation|damnation]].
> Uniilas have an innate and exceptionally frightening spellcasting ability, and can offer nearby mortal spellcasters the ability to prepare and cast additional spells. The fiends can prepare a witch token, in the form of a ring or other item, which makes a mortal spellcaster's spells more difficult to resist but allows the uniila to scry upon and harm the spellcaster at will.
