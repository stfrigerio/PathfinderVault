> An **adlet** is an aggressive, white-furred, [[Wolf|wolf-like]] [[Humanoid|humanoid]] resident in polar regions.



## Society

> Adlet culture is strongly warlike and xenophobic. Adlets see themselves as the natural rulers of the arctic and view all other intelligent beings as squatters and invaders, often responding to their presence with aggressive raids. However, some merchants have been able to establish peaceful contact with adlet tribes living near well-traveled routes.


## History

> According to adlet legend, their kind was created when a lost hunter came upon a house of whalebone and ice inhabited by a woman dressed in white [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fox|fox]] furs. The woman took in the hunter and tended to him, and the two eventually married and had ten children. Five of these had the legs and tails of foxes, and the other five had the legs and tails of wolves. The fox-legged children remained with their mother, while the wolf-legged ones returned to [[Human|human]] lands alongside their father and became the first adlets.


## Adlets on Golarion

> Some decades ago, a tribe of adlets from the [[Stormspear Mountains]] attacked and conquered the [[Varki|Varkis]] [[Cavern of the Sacred Shapes]] in [[Icemark]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]].


## Adlets on Triaxus

> Adlets also inhabit the [[Planet|planet]] [[Triaxus]]. Many Triaxian adlets hail from the area surrounding the Vahara Glacier, but they have been driven from their homelands by the [[White dragon|white dragon]] warlord [[Yrax]] of the [[Drakelands]]. One of the adlets' holiest sites is the Rimekeening Crevasse, the final resting place of the adlet hero [[Sarnok]]. The adlets believe that Sarnok will one day return to guide them.
