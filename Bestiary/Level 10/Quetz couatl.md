*This article is about the type of [[Couatl|couatl]]. For the [[Pterosaur|pterosaur]] , see [[Quetzalcoatlus|quetzalcoatlus]].*
> Feathered [[Serpent|serpents]] that serve the highest powers of [[Good|good]], [[Couatl|couatls]] are not only powerful creatures but also powerful symbols of goodness. The most common variety of couatl is the **quetz couatl**.



## Appearance

> A quetz couatl has the body of a huge [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake]] with very brightly coloured scales. Large [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird]] wings covered in feathers of myriad brilliant tones grow from its back. The average quetz couatl is around 12 feet long with a wingspan of 15 feet. A quetz couatl is such an impressive sight that it can awe more primitive peoples into believing it to be a [[Deity|god]].


## Habitat and ecology

> Quetz couatls are most often found in warm forests, particularly the rainforests of the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. It is in the Expanse that quetz couatls face their most hated enemy, the [[Baregara|baregara]], who are cruel, [[Ape|simian]], [[Demon|demon]] minions of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Angazhan]]. The baregara return this hatred in a mutual enmity between the creatures because of the quetz couatls' [[Good|good]] nature.
> Quetz couatls dedicate themselves to teaching the virtues of goodness and wisdom to those they encounter and are considered paragons of wisdom and beauty, with some even regarding them as gods. While quetz couatls do not encourage this reverence, they tolerate it if it helps them spread their message. Despite their [[Outsider|outsider]] nature, quetz couatls still have to eat, preferring the small birds, reptiles, and other [[Animal|animals]] favoured by the snakes they resemble. However, they have also been known to consume the bodies of fallen enemies. Sometimes if a quetz couatl favours a person, it offers some of its feathers to be used to [[Magic/Conjuration|summon]] it later.
