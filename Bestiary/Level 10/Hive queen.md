## Appearance

> A hive queen resembles an enormous insect armoured in black chitin, with caustic saliva dripping from her mandibles. A hive queen is 17 feet tall and weighs 2,100 pounds.


## Ecology

> Hive queens are created through advanced [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]] procedures. Normally, they are dormant and concern themselves with laying eggs, only defending their clutch when the hive is threatened. A hive queen that survives her colony's destruction rampages and destroys everything in her path until she can find a suitable location to build another colony.
