> A **fext** is an [[Undead|undead]] creature raised to serve as an experienced military commander. They are relatively recent to [[Golarion]], having been created by members of the [[Whispering Way]]. Fexts may be related to the [[Spellscar fext|Spellscar fexts]] of the [[Mana Wastes]], as they both share a vulnerability to glass weapons.
