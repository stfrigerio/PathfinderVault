> **Veldenars** are ambush predators native to the [[Plane of Air]] that resemble large, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Frog|frog-like]] creatures with six eyes, translucent skin, and a small tail. Veldenars hunt by waiting in areas where prey is common, [[Magic|magically]] making themselves invisible to avoid detection, and wait for prey to pass by. When a target approaches it, a veldenar releases a cloud of very dense air to slow it down, before opening its mouth to create a vacuum effect to suck its prey into is stomach. Veldenars primarily hunt gaseous beings such as [[Belker|belkers]] and [[Mihstu|mihstus]], as well as giant insects and creatures tied to the element of fire, they usually attack anything that comes too close to them.
