>  **Whales** are massive aquatic [[cetaceans]] with fins, a tail with horizontal flukes, and blowholes on top of the head.



## Appearance

>  Regardless of subspecies, most whales are immense and graceful beasts of the seas.


## Abilities

>  Whales tend to be peaceful, but when provoked (or, for carnivorous whales, when on the hunt) they can bite, slap foes with their tail, or simply ram themselves into a target.


## Ecology

>  Some whales travel alone or in pairs, but in the wild many also form pods of a dozen members or more.
>  The many subspecies of whale include:

>  - Baleen whales, which feed through the namesake comb-like filters in their mouths
>  - [[Blue whales]], tremendous filter-feeding whales with powerful tails
>  - [[Crimson whales]], aggressive hunters known for their large teeth and red skin
>  - [[Faceless whales]], pale sightless creatures also known as [[Darklands]] whales
>  - [[Fire whales]], cetaceans native to the [[Plane of Fire]] but now found in several areas of the [[Material Plane]].
>  - Great white whales, colossal and aggressive beasts
>  - [[Narwhals]], small whales whose males bear a six-foot-long tusk above their mouths
>  - [[Orcas]]
>  - Sperm whales
