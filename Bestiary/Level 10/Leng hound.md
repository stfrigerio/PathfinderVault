> **Leng hounds** are a race of bestial [[Ghoul|ghoul]]-like man-eating [[Sorted Traits/creature/aberration|aberrations]] native to the nightmarish Plateau of [[Leng]].


## Appearance

> In its true form, a Leng hound resembles a corpselike hunchbacked [[Humanoid|humanoid]] covered in fur, with clawed hands and paws, [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bat]] wings and a partially [[Canine|canine]] face. It is seven feet tall but weighs only 150 pounds. It is capable of retracting its bestial features: fur and wings retract, the skin covering them slithers into hidden cavities and jaws pull back to a [[Human|human]] face. Leng hounds prefer to lurk inside the coffins they guard, rearranging their bodies into skeletal shapes.


## Ecology

> On their home [[Plane|plane]], Leng hounds haunt its unimaginably old ruins and roam the desolate tableland in search for prey to bring to their masters. They eagerly accept being [[Summoned|summoned]] to the [[Material Plane]] to serve as guards of graves containing the corpse of [[Evil|evil]] creatures, in exchange for the opportunity to feast upon other corpses in the cemetery. If a creature disturbs or loots this grave, the Leng hound can track the looters or looted goods across the universe, and emits a deep, sardonic howl that only the thieves can hear.
