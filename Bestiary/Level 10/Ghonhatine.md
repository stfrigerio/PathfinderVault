> **Ghonhatines** are the result of [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]] conducted on [[Xulgath|xulgaths]], transformed by [[Drow|drow]] and other xulgaths who seek to reconstruct how prehistoric xulgaths once looked like: hulking, quadrupedal creatures that obey their masters and furiously tear at their foes.



## Appearance

> Ghonhatines look like some nightmare-spawned [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaur]] dragged from ancient prehistory into modern day [[Golarion]]. Even when squatting on all four these creatures are taller than the average [[Human|human]]. The ghonhatine barely resemble the xulgaths they were spawned from, with the xulgath's savage speed and agility replaced by vast amounts of muscles and armoured scales. Even a starved ghonhatine (and few can consume enough to be considered well fed) weighs over five thousand pounds. Their total length including their long, sinuous tails can stretch up to twenty seven feet. If a ghonhatine could be kept well feed throughout its life it could potentially grow even larger with rumours of such huge beast being a constant whisper throughout the [[Darklands]].


## Habitat & Ecology

> Ghonhatines are primarily a slave race subservient to the cruel drow whose twisted experiments and tortures created them. The only habitat most ghonhatines know is the sites their beast-masters put them to work in and the slave pens their kept in. As a primitive slave race they have no culture, their rare interactions with other ghonhatines resembling the interaction of crocodiles more than anything else.
> The ecology of of the ghonhatines would, at first glance suggest that they were an incredibly successful fleshwarp perhaps even on par with the fearsome [[Drider|driders]]. They are docile, strong, heavily armed and armoured but they have one weakness that reduces their effectiveness as slaves which is their life span. From the moment they are created they are dying, after creation they constantly become more and more ravenous needing to consume more food. Most drow find the effort of trying to feed ghonhatines after they reach a year old to be too much effort as some ghonhatines can consume up to half their weight in meat a day. When ghonhatine reach this age their drow masters typically either exterminate them or send them on a suicide mission hurling them against their enemies like expendable ammunition. Despite their ferocious nature ghonhatines are more often used as slaves than weapons of war. Their large size and lumbering nature makes them unsuitable for the drow method of stealthy warfare.


## Abilities

Feed
By devouring a dead or dying creature the ghonhatine instantly invigorated by their meal making them more dangerous.
Powerful Stench
Like the weaker troglodyte ghonhatine can emit a powerful stench that sickens any near by creatures.
Regurgitate
The ghonhatine can regurgitate the contents of its stomach in a horrific attack. This regurgitated stomach content is not only disgusting but highly contagious often causing the victim to contract [[Diseases of GolarionFilth fever|filth fever]] if he survives the encounter at all.
