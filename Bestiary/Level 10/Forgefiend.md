> **Scanderigs**, or **forgefiends** as they are generally known, are creatures from the Elemental [[Plane of Earth]] who come to [[Golarion]] to feed their insatiable hunger for metallic ores of all kinds. Because of this, they are particularly dreaded by [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/dwarf|dwarves]].

## Abilities

> A scanderig's jaws are made of a substance as hard as [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]], allowing it to cut easily through the hardest ores and [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]]. When threatened, a scanderig can project a heap of red-hot slag from its mouth.
> As most natives of its plane of origin, a scanderig can glide through rock and earth as easily as a fish through water, leaving no discernible trail or tunnel behind.
> Forgefiends can see through any type of darkness, whether [[Magic|magical]] and mundane.
