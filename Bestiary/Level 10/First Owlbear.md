> The **First Owlbear** is the ancient ancestor of the [[Owlbear|owlbears]], still alive despite his extreme age. He has a harem of [[Bear|bears]], [[Giant owl|giant owls]], and other owlbears, and his offspring are always owlbears. Fecund, nomadic, and cantankerous, he is followed by his mates when hunting, driving them off when he tires of their company or food becomes scarce. Unlike most owlbears, the First Owlbear can fly.
