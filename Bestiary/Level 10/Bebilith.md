> The **bebilith** is an infernally-spawned, [[Vermin|vermin-like]] creature whose sole purpose seems to be to hunt and devour its [[Demon|demonic]] prey. It is likely that bebiliths were created by the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Mazmezz]], back when she was still a [[Qlippoth lord|qlippoth lord]].


## Appearance

> Bebiliths resemble some sort of demented, demonic version of a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spider]] that could only be conceived in the depths of the [[Abyss]]. Bebiliths have eight legs, but stand atop six spindly legs while the front pair of legs end in two enormous scything claws, each nearly the height of a [[Humanoid|humanoid]]. The body of the bebilith looks just as spider-like with crustacean elements: a carapace-covered torso with a head, featuring red multi-faceted eyes, below which sits the grasping maw of a spider. Rather than dripping with [[Poison|poison]], the bebilith's maw instead is infested with a terrible rot that destroys flesh at an alarming rate.


## Habitat and ecology

> Bebiliths dwell in the depths of the Abyss, but they are not in fact demons like most of the plane's inhabitants. Instead they are the natural predators of the realm, feasting on demons who have so brazenly claimed the Abyss as their own. While bebiliths do not require any sort of sustenance, they seem to prefer the taste of demon flesh. This may be a blessing for the rest of the multiverse, as bebiliths posses the ability to shift between the planes at will. The bebilith seems to have evolved specifically to hunt and destroy demons, as their claws are able to cut through their prey's normally damage-resistant flesh. Additionally, bebiliths are far more intelligent than they look, making them a truly fearsome predator.
