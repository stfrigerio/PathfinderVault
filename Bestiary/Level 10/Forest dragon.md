> **Forest dragons** are a species of [[Evil|evil]] [[Imperial dragon|imperial dragons]] who inhabit the forests of the continent of [[Tian Xia]], where they are also known as **dilungs**. Forest dragons shun [[Technology|technology]] and civilization, preferring the company of [[Beast|beasts]] and monsters.



## Appearance

> A forest dragon is a long, coiling serpentine creature with jade scales and deerlike antlers. When it moves, its scales sound like grinding stones. As forest dragons age, they take on the appearance of the forest itself, growing mossy hair and bark-like hide, with small [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/animal|animals]] and insects inhabiting their surface.


## Abilities

> A dilung's breath weapon is a swarm of biting insects that can [[Poison|poison]] their foes. Adult and older forest dragons are able to quickly absorb moisture from their surroundingsâ€”including from creaturesâ€”to [[Medicine|heal]], often killing surrounding [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/plant|plant]] life and lowering nearby natural water reserves. Truly ancient forest dragons can turn foes into wood with their bites. In addition to the shared ability of all imperial dragons to take the form of [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/humanoid|humanoids]], forest dragons can additionally take the shape of great trees, blending in with their forest environment. All forest dragons are weak to [[Metal|metal]] and are invigorated by water, as per the draconic cycle.


## Habitat and society

> As their name implies, forest dragons inhabit deep woodlands. They are vicious, fickle hunters who prefer to stalk along the ground despite their ability to fly.


## On Golarion

> Forest dragons are common in the [[Forest of Spirits]], where they are violently at odds with the forest's [[Kami|kami]] guardians. Legend tells that a mighty forest dragon was among the vengeful spirits who rose up against the greedy [[Samurai|samurai]] [[Zaokoyu]]'s empire of Zao in the distant past.
> In the [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]] nation of [[Kwanlai]], a titanic dilung ruled the bamboo forest in the [[Vale of Green Spears]] and once plundered [[Ship|ships]] on the nearby [[Gulf of Xidao]]. The dragon died, but her brood still lurks in the forest.
> An adult forest dragon named [[Toishihebi]] lairs in the ruins of the city of Uddo in the nation of [[Minkai]].


### In astrology

> The Forest Dragon is one of the twelve [[Constellation|constellations]] of the [[Tian Xia]] [[Zodiac|zodiac]]. Individuals born under the sign of the Forest Dragon are said to be shrewd, cautious, and sensual in their better moments, but dishonest, vengeful, and remote in bad times.
