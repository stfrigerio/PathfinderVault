This doesn't change the raja rakshasa's Speed or its attack and damage modifiers with its [[Strike|Strikes]] but might change the damage type its [[Strike|Strikes]] deal (typically to bludgeoning). It typically loses its fangs [[Strike]] unless the humanoid form has fangs or a similar unarmed attack."

All creatures in the area are assailed by a vision of evil decadence from one of the rakshasa's past lives. Each non-evil creature in the area must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or become [[sickened|sickened 1]] (and [[stunned|stunned 1]] on a critical failure). The visions last 1d4 (1d4) rounds, and while they do, the raja rakshasa and all evil creatures in the area gain a +1 status bonus to all checks. The raja rakshasa can use this ability again only once the previous visions end."

> **Raja rakshasas** are the most widespread and commonly encountered species of [[Rakshasa|rakshasa]]. Also simply known as **rakshasas**, they are more powerful than some members of their kind and less powerful than others, and represent the ideal midpoint between servitor and master.



## Appearance

> In their natural form, raja rakshasas can be recognized by their [[Animal|animal]] heads (those of great [[Cat|cats]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]], [[Crocodile|crocodiles]], [[Ape|apes]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]] of prey being the most common) and backward-facing hands. In most cases, a raja's head is indicative of its personality. A raja is six feet tall and weighs 180 pounds.


## Society

> In order to bring down or secretly take over whole cities, raja rakshasas gather in close-knit families that often incorporate others of their kind, like [[Dandasuka|dandasukas]], who serve as servants or spies. The rajas constantly scheme and bicker among each other, even as they work together toward their shared goal.


### Religion

> Raja rakshasas are disdainful of religion, even by rakshasa standards. They recognise the power of [[Deity|deities]], but view themselves as the only things that deserve worship.
