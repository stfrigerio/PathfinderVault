> **Sacristans** are a caste of relatively unintelligent [[Velstrac|velstracs]] created by other velstracs as [[Slaves|slaves]].



## Appearance

> Sacristans vary in their appearance, but always look like tortured and maimed [[Humanoid|humanoids]], often with redundant or absent features. They typically stand between six and eight feet tall and weigh from 80 to 160 pounds.


## Abilities

> Sealed within each sacristan's mouth is miniature, permanent [[Portal|portal]] to the [[Shadow Plane]]. Kept restrained, this portal endlessly howls a cacophony of darkness and [[Soul|soul]]-shaking howls from the pits of the realms of the velstracs. When threatened, sacristans open their mouths and allow this song to seduce their foes.


## Ecology

> Sacristans are bound together by [[Interlocutor|interlocutors]] from scraps of imperfect flesh, bent chain and scarred minds. They lack free will and their minds are etched with the ability to serve, making them utterly obedient to other velstracs. Sacristans take ecstatic pleasure from serving fellow velstracs.
