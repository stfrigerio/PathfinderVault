The roper can move while it has a creature [[grabbed|grabbed]] with a strand, but it automatically releases the creature if it moves beyond the strand's reach. The roper can release an [[grabbed|grabbed]] creature as a free action. A creature can sever a strand with a target attack that hits AC 27 and deals at least 18 slashing damage.

> **Ropers** are cone-shaped, subterranean [[Sorted Traits/creature/aberration|aberrations]] who change their color to blend in with their environment and ambush prey.



## Origin

> Ropers believe they were created by [[Rovagug]], and seek to discover the reason for their existence. One tale claims that Rovagug's blood was spilled and tainted an underground cavern, with the pollution forming the ropers.
> There are similarities between ropers and [[Mimic|mimics]], and some sages believe they might have a common ancestry, with the ropers possibly being the result of the experiments of a mad [[Wizard|wizard]].


## Appearance

> Ropers appear as nothing more than stony outcrops until they send forth their strands and open their massive, two-foot-wide maws. Their stony hides are typically six inches thick. They have no blood; instead, fine dust passes through their interior channels.
> A typical specimen is nine feet tall and weighs 2,200 pounds.


## Habitat and society

> Ropers live in the rocky caverns beneath [[Golarion|Golarions]] surface, and lose their will to live if exiled from the [[Darklands]] for any significant length of time.
> They gather in cabals and engage in [[Philosophy|philosophical]] explorations of pain and terror. They enjoy conversing with their intelligent victims as they eat them one limb at a time; the prey can avoid death for as long as the roper finds it interesting.
> Both male and female ropers exist.
> A roper derives its sustenance solely from the bones of its victims, and ultimately spews any of their flesh and blood.


## Abilities

> Ropers have incredibly tough skin, and are extremely strong and hardy. They can extend up to six fifty-foot-long strands from their bodies. These strands grapple, numb, and weaken their victims before bringing them into the roper's fearsome maw to be devoured at leisure.


## Variants

> Ropers are a diverse race.


### Basalt roper

> Also known as **vulkards**, their stony skin resembles basalt. They feed on fire and grow stronger when exposed to it.


### Molting strangler

> These ropers shed their outer carapace every few months. The more they do this, the more mutable their forms become, until eventually they can take on other forms in a similar way to [[Mimic|mimics]].
> Their shed skins can sometimes take on a strange half-life of their own. Molting stranglers sometimes use them as decoys to lure victims into traps.


### Shard strangler

> These brutal and pragmatic ropers have jagged threads which damage, grapple, and weaken foes. They can inflict particularly nasty wounds on foes grasped by more than one thread.


### Sigil crag

> A roper who consumes a suitable victim (such as a powerful spellcaster) in a suitably slow fashion can manifest a crystal [[Rune|rune]] on its carapace. These ropers are known as **sigil crags**. Most have only a few such runes, but particularly old ones might develop numerous sigils. A sigil crag can create one magical symbol per day per rune it exhibits.


## On Golarion

> Ropers can be found across vast expanses of underground terrain. An [[Elf|elven]] explorer named [[Talsindro Yarmaht]] was one of the first to attempt to map the ropers' territory. His letters and maps are kept under lock and key at the [[Grand Lodge]] of the [[Pathfinder Society]] in [[Absalom]].
> Ropers live in the Darklands region of [[Nar-Voth]], especially in a large cave called the [[Endless Gulf]]. Ropers in the deeper region of [[Sekamina]] attack travelers who attempt to reach the [[Lake Nirthran|Dying Sea]].
> Closer to the surface, ropers live in ice caves in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] and are known locally as the [[Takers in the Ice]].


## On distant worlds

> Ropers also live on the distant planet [[Triaxus]], where they behave much the same as their Golarion-based kindred.
