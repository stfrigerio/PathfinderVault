> **Nyogoths** are a race of ravenous [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] that fill the ecological niche of scavengers in the [[Abyss]].



## Appearance

> A nyogoth appears to be a mass of intestines tangled around a fanged mouth. The tips of its coils also end in toothy maws. Its body is full of highly corrosive digestive fluid, and it squirts through the air in convulsive movements. A typical nyogoth is 5 feet in diameter and weighs 260 pounds, although they are known to grow much larger.


## Abilities

> Creatures that succumb to a nyogoth's horrific appearance become nauseated.


## Ecology

> Nyogoths roam the Abyssal realms, feeding on natives and intruders alike. They can subsist on the waste and filth left behind by other denizens of the Abyss, but prefer living creatures. Being [[Outsider|outsiders]], nyogoths can survive without food, although a hungry nyogoth that hasn't eaten for 12 hours becomes increasingly violent and erratic and will fight to the death when the prospect of food is available, to the point of consuming its own digestive juices.
> Nyogoths can be made from creatures that have been absorbed and remade by the [[Iathavos|iathavos]] qlippothâ€”one of the worst fates that could befall explorers of the deep Abyss. These nyogoths squirm over its body or under its bulk, feeding upon the wastes and fragments left behind by the iathavos.
