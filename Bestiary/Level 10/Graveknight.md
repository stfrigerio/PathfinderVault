> A **graveknight** is a powerful [[Undead|undead]] warrior. Analogous in some ways to a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]], a graveknight's [[Spirit|spirit]] lingers in its [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]], and a graveknight whose armor survives will rejuvenate in a matter of days.



## Appearance

> A graveknight appears as a monstrous suit of profane armor covering a desiccated corpse. These creatures bear the same [[Weapon|weapons]] and garb as in life, but twisted by the profane reanimation.


## Behavior & ecology

> Graveknights are undead creatures that rise from fallen warlords, and wicked [[Fighter|fighters]]. They are tyrants and leaders of the unliving, gaining the innate ability to bring both non-intelligent and intelligent undead under their command. They can unleash destructive blasts of energy and [[Magic/Conjuration|summon]] [[Evil|unholy]] mounts to bear them in combat.

 A graveknight prepares to smite [[Seelah]].
> The [[Necromancer|necromancer]] [[Geb (person)|Geb]] responded to a failed raid on his nation of [[Geb's Rest]] by the [[Knights of Ozem]], by reanimating six of the fallen [[Knight|knights]] as graveknights. He ordered them north to their former home of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], where they stole the corpse of [[Arazni]], patron of the Knights, and returned with it to Geb. Geb animated Arazni as a lich, and the five remaining graveknights still serve as her bodyguard.
> North in [[Avistan]], a powerful [[Stone giant|stone giant]] graveknight of the [[Giant|giant]] god [[Minderhal]] is said to guard the Tomb of the First Battle in the [[Hold of Belkzen]].


> Paizo has published two major articles about graveknights: a chapter about graveknights in *[[Undead Revisited]]* and "Armored Fiends" in *[[Ice Tomb of the Giant Queen]]*.
