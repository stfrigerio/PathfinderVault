> **Seugathi savants** are immense [[Seugathi|seugathi]] with greater intelligence and talent for [[Psychic magic|psychic magic]] than their lesser siblings.


## Appearance

> A seugathi savant is a bruise-coloured worm that walks on hundreds of legs. It measure 35 feet long and weighs 7,000 pounds.


## Ecology

> If a seugathi finds the task given by its [[Neothelid|neothelid]] creator impossible, it enters a manic [[Insanity|insanity]] during its struggle for a solution. After years or decades in solitude, it usually turns to ravaging the minds of prophets and mystics, and in doing so, it expands its mind and develops into a seugathi savant when it concludes that the task is truly impossible. A seugathi savant's first act is to question its neothelid creator for its purpose; many times, neothelids answer that it was their intention to give the seugathi an unattainable task to trigger its development.
> Like standard seugathi, seugathi savants are controlled by the neothelids, but they perceive more of their masters' schemes and are granted more flexibility in fulfilling their missions. Seugathi savants ignore their lesser siblings, viewing them as unworthy drones, but are irritated by how normal seugathi revere them as wise older siblings.
