> **Formian myrmarchs** are the elite caste of the [[Formian|formian]] hive.



## Appearance

> Formian myrmarchs have upper bodies as big as [[Formian warrior|warriors]], but their enlarged thorax and abdomen give them the same general size as a [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]]. Their tail ends in a wickedly barbed stinger. Like other formians, myrmarchs record their life history and accomplishments upon their carapaces. Some myrmarchs live long enough to run out of space on their exoskeletons and have to add new artificial plates to continue recording.


## Ecology

> Formian myrmarchs live relatively long lives by formian standards (roughly as long as [[Human|humans]] do). Due to their aristocratic role, they are even deadlier than the warriors under their command, and often fight with [[Javelin|javelins]] tipped with their own [[Venom|venom]].


## Society

> Formian myrmarchs answer directly to the [[Formian queen|queen]], serving as her agents, advisers, bodyguards and generals, as well as administrators and diplomats in tasks deemed too difficult for [[Formian taskmaster|taskmasters]].
