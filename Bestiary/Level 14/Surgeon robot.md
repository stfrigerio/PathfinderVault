> **Surgeon robots** are a model of [[Mantis|mantis]]-like [[Robot|robots]] designed by the [[Androffa|Androffans]] to perfectly perform complicated [[Surgery|surgery]] on patients of various species. To aid them in their job, surgeon robots are armed with various surgical tools, a database full of techniques and alien physiologies, and an internal, [[Nanite|nanite]]-powered pharmaceutical [[Laboratory|laboratory]]. Driven to perfect their craft, surgeon robots regularly need new test subjects and are willing to collect such subjects against their will. The [[Technic League]] has never succeeded to deactivate this obsession from reprogrammed surgeon robots, and they sometimes work as surgeons for other creatures in exchange for subjects. Aside from [[Medicine|medicine]], they have also been used to torture subjects or keep them [[Drug|drugged]] for months. Surgeon robots stand seven feet tall in their normal quadrupedal gait, or ten feet when standing upright, and weigh a bit more than 600 pounds.
