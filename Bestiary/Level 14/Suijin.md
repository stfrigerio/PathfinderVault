> **Suijins**, or **water kami**, are a type of [[Kami|kami]] associated with lakes, ponds, springs, and wells.



## Appearance

> When not merged with their wards, suijins resemble giant carp or [[Sea serpent|sea serpents]], usually beautiful specimens with rainbow scales. A typical suijin is 15 feet long and weighs about 1,200 pounds. It is suggested that lesser and greater suijins exist, typically in bodies of water proportionate to their size and power.


## Ecology

> Reclusive even by kami standards, suijins often only emerge from their wards in order to protect innocent creatures nearby, usually secretly if possible. Suijins are infinitely patient, and though most enjoy helping creatures, those in remote areas care far less about [[Mortal|mortals]] and are content simply protecting their wards. Suijins often simply accept things as they are, based on the belief that all things are fluid and subject to change.
> A suijin's ward is usually a good indicator of its temperament: those in turbulent wards are usually less calm and tolerant of outsiders, although they all typically mean well. Suijins whose wards are abused by civilisation can be much more hard-hearted.
> One can earn a suijin's approval by placing minerals or [[Gem|gemstones]] within its ward, and those who pollute the waters or use it for [[Evil|evil]] are quick to gain its ire. Unusual floods and droughts are signs of a suijin's displeasure, and those who do not appease it or change their destructive ways will feel the full brunt of its fearsome wrath.
> Suijins who continually fail to protect their wards are often quick to fall out of favour with others. Their wards become treacherous as the suijin gradually transforms into an [[Oni|oni]].


## Society

> A suijin can occupy virtually any body of water, and a particularly social one might choose to occupy an urban aqueduct if the inhabitants are environmentally conscious. Such settlements appreciate the blessing of the suijin, who cleans and purifies the waters.
> Suijins are solitary and rarely associate with other kami due to an adherence to a loosely established territorial pact: their powers are more valuable when spread, rather than concentrated on particular bodies of water. Suijins only interact at points where two bodies of water meet. If they are healthy and the suijins uncorrupted, it is said that they celebrate in a bonding ritual and create a new suijin. This ritual can be seen as motes of blue and green light whirling in the shallows of the adjoining water.
