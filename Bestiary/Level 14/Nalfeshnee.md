> **Nalfeshnees** are huge, physically powerful, [[Boar|boar]]-headed [[Demon|demons]]. They are sometimes known as **greed demons** or **boar demons**.



## Associated sin

> Greed.


## Appearance

> Nalfeshnees are massive, four-armed, boar-headed demons. Their hands are fat, and have four fingers rather than five. They are among the largest of the demons; a typical specimen is 20 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds.


## Habitat and society

> Nalfeshnees do not tend to gather in groups, and are typically either alone or in the company of lesser demons. It is believed that they are formed from the [[Soul|souls]] of exceptionally greedy (and successful) [[Mortal|mortals]].
> They are extremely intelligent, and have an excellent understanding of the nature of the [[Abyss]]. They sometimes claim to be serving the Abyss itself rather than a specific [[Demon lord|demon lord]]. They have a talent for ordering the Abyss's [[Chaos|chaos]].


## Abilities

> A nalfeshnee's immense strength, equal to that of an ancient [[White dragon|white dragon]], and huge teeth and claws make them fearsome combatants. They can also create a burst of [[Unholy|unholy]] light that imparts stunning visions of [[Madness|madness]] to any non-demons caught within.


## Environment

> Nalfeshnees are native to the Abyss, and some of them rule realms larger than the most impressive mortal kingdoms.
> Their intellects make them a target for mortal [[Summoner|summoners]] seeking information rather than mere physical prowess. Each nalfeshnee has areas of interest in which it is highly knowledgeable, but before a nalfeshnee reveals a secret, it typically demands a secret of at least equal value in return.
> A large number of nalfeshnees serve the demon lord [[Angazhan]] in his realm of [[Ahvoth-Kor]], although most are too proud to admit it.
> On [[Golarion]], nalfeshnees can be found in the [[Tanglebriar]] swamp in [[Kyonin]], as part of the forces of [[Treerazer]].


> [[Paizo]] published a sourcebook about demons called *[[Demons Revisited]]*, which includes a full chapter about nalfeshnees.
