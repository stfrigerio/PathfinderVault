> **Tletli couatls** are vengeful, destructive [[Couatl|couatls]] who wreak havoc on [[Evil|evildoers]] they deem unredeemable.



## Appearance

> A tletli couatl is a massive [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|serpent]] whose iridescent scales seem to reflect light like an [[Opal|opal]]. Its feathered wings are shrouded in flames, ranging from orange at the base to blue at the tips. The flames can even burn creatures made of flame and are especially effective against [[Undead|undead]], evil [[Outsider|outsiders]], and [[Dragon|dragons]]. A typical tletli couatl is 35 feet long with a wingspan of 25 feet, and weighs almost 6,000 pounds.


## Ecology

> Tletli couatls do not hunt down individuals but target whole groups that they consider to be beyond redemption, and channel their righteous fury to destroy them, offering no salvation.
> Tletli couatls occasionally offer their feathers to [[Mortality|mortals]], who can use a tletli couatl's feather to [[Summon|summon]] the specific tletli couatl without the need for payment, if the tletli couatl approves of the service that the mortal asks it to do.


## Habitat

> Tletli couatls' rarity is legendary: they only appear in areas full of individuals whose crimes do not permit redemption. Such targets include towns filled with [[Undead|undead]], forests plagued with [[Evil|evil]] [[Fey|fey]], or [[Portal|portals]] that bring forth [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]].


## Society

> Tletli couatls serve as executioners, exacting punishment on irredeemable regions. Before doing so, they typically enlist mortals to extend a final chance for redemption for their quarries. If there are innocents in the company of the tletli couatl's targets, it might forewarn them by sending a [[Magic/Enchantment|charmed]] emissary, but does not hesitate to burn the entire group to ashes, as its prerogative is punishment, not mercy. Because of this, their masters usually send other [[Celestial|celestials]] to accompany tletli couatls to evacuate or protect innocents during the tletli couatl's razing.


### Religion

> Many tletli couatls serve [[Good|good]] [[Deity|deities]] like [[Sarenrae]] or [[Torag]], or [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lords]] such as [[Ragathiel]], [[Dammerich]], or [[Olheon]].


## Inhabitants

> According to legends, tletli couatls were prominent on [[Golarion]] during the [[Age of Darkness]], as they worked to fight the evils that rose at that time.
