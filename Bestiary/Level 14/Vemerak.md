> Created by the [[Rovagug|god of destruction]], **vemeraks** were designed to delight in the suffering caused by his most fearsome servants, the [[Spawn of Rovagug]].



## Appearance

> A vemerak is a huge insect-like creature that towers over the average [[Humanoid|humanoid]] at 10 feet tall and over 20 feet long. Its huge size means they weigh over six tons. Its body resembles a twisted [[Ant|ant]] with far too many legs sprouting from its chitinous abdomen. Attached to the rear of the vemerak's abdomen is a set of three writhing, whipping, slime-covered tentacles. At the other end is the head pod filled with tiny insectoid eyes and a hideous mass of tentacles and feelers that passes for a mouth, and two [[Scorpion|scorpion]]-like pincers emerge from either side of it. Much of the vemerak's body is covered in living [[Fungus|mould]] that sheds clouds of spores as it moves.


## Habitat and ecology

> Vemeraks dwell in the deepest, darkest depths of the [[Darklands]], far from most civilised creatures. They are legendary predators rarely seen by even the dwellers of [[Sekamina]] as they often also live in [[Orv]]. Despite their love of the darkest depths, the original vemeraks dwelt on [[Golarion|Golarions]] surface. In ancient times, when the Spawn of Rovagug walked the earth destroying all they came across, vemeraks roamed in their wake.
> They were more than mere scavengers, though, for while the Spawn of Rovagug were a manifestation of utter destruction, they were mindless and took no joy from the destruction they caused. Vemeraks, however, do; they are unconscious creations of Rovagug's desire to revel in the pain and misery created by such destruction. Every vemerak has a divine link with [[Rovagug]] himself who is buried deep in the earth. Since the decline of the Spawn of Rovagug, vemeraks have found themselves drawn towards their master's voice speaking to them from the very depths of the underground.
> Vemeraks are not restricted to [[Golarion]], and can be found on [[Triaxus]].


## Abilities

> A vemerak can vomit a sickening line of flesh-burning acid, stab their legs into the earth to create small earthquakes, and emit clouds of spores that are resistant to [[Magic|magical]] attacks.
