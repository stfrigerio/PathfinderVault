> Created using a small fortune's worth of metal, **brass golems** are not only powerful guardians but are potent symbols of wealth.



## Appearance

> Brass golems look like towering brass statues well over 20 feet in height. The precise appearance of the [[Golem|golem]] is determined by the sculptor, but they always boast a powerful and intimidating stature. Brass golems are most often sculpted to resemble either fearsome [[Demon|demons]] or their original creators the [[Efreet|efreet]]. In theory, brass golems could be sculpted in any humanoid form but they rarely are seen in any other form. No matter their overall shape, their faces are sculpted into an intimidating scowl and they normally sport a set of stylised brass horns and always wield a large weapon, normally a falchion. Due to their solid metal construction, these golems weigh upwards of six tons and their lava interior means they visibly radiate heat.


## Habitat & Ecology

> Brass golems can be found wherever powerful [[Genie|genies]] need utterly loyal guardians or protectors, from the underground vaults of the [[Shaitan|shaitan]] on the [[Plane of Earth|Elemental Plane of Earth]] to the efreeti cities on the [[Plane of Fire|Elemental Plane of Fire]]. Brass golems are most commonly found in the efreet [[City of Brass]] and having one is seen as a sign of status amongst the lesser nobles of the city. The [[Hakim Khalid Suleiman XXIII|Grand Sultan]] himself is said to have a platoon of brass golems. On the [[Material Plane]] brass golems are rare, and can most commonly be found guarding ancient sites created by powerful [[Wizard|wizards]]. The secret of brass golem creation is normally granted only to wizards that frequently traffic with genies, and as such are most often found in the world's wildest deserts. As constructs, brass golems have very little impact on their surroundings unless ordered to by their master. Brass golems are created from several tons of the purest brass, generally using minerals from the elemental planes themselves. They are unique amongst the golems in that they are animated by spirits of elemental fire rather than the more stable earth spirits.


## History

> The origin of the brass golem is steeped in legend, but are known to have been created in the City of Brass. According to legend, an ancient grand sultan of the efreet had a concubine so beautiful and fiery that any efreet who saw her was instantly smitten and stop at nothing to claim her for there own. Afraid of such a devastating loss the sultan commissioned his wisest advisers to find him a guard who felt no lust, would never lapse in his duty and who could not be bribed. His advisers searched the planes for such a person but could not find him. In the end it was a visiting [[Shaitan|shaitan]] wizard who came up with the solution, presenting the sultan with the first brass golem. The sultan ordered the brass golem to kill anyone trying to enter his harem. Unfortunately he forgot to exclude himself and the next morning he was found dead outside his harem, killed by the brass golem's sword.
