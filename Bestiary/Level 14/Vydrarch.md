> The **Vydrarch** was once thought to have been a unique, legendary [[Dragon|sea dragon]] that lived in [[Varisia|Varisias]] [[Outcast's Cove|Outcasts Cove]] beneath the shadow of the [[Irespan]]. According to historic accounts he was as large as a castle tower. His slaying marked the founding of the city of [[Magnimar]]. Recent reports from sailors have confirmed that other such terrible, gargantuan creatures exist in the [[Steaming Sea]], where they satiate their lust for destruction by attacking passing [[Ship|ships]].
