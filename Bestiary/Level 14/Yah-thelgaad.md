> The result of a [[Neh-thalggu|neh-thalggu]] absorbing a critical mass of mental energy, **yah-thelgaad** are even more efficient harvesters of power from brains. They hold a fanatical faith in the Ineffable Void, a cryptic mystery of the [[Dominion of the Black]].



## Appearance

> The yah-thelgaad is a creature covered in spiky chitinous plates with a forest of tendrils on its 'face' and a sharp tail. Its back is adorned with six transparent blisters containing a green liquid.


## Ecology

> Once a neh-thalggu has absorbed enough thoughts and memories from the brains it collects, it enters a torpor and consumes its seven oldest collected brains. Over several days, it undergoes a metamorphosis into a yah-thelgaad. While yah-thelgaads can only store six brains (compared to a neh-thalggu's seven), they draw twice the power from each brain, and can collect the brains of non-[[Humanoid|humanoid]] creatures as well.


## Society

> In addition to their loyalty to the Dominion of the Black, they are also fanatically devoted to the Dominion's theology, which includes [[Mystery|mysteries]] such as the Ineffable Void. High-ranking yah-thelgaads often become [[Inquisitor|inquisitors]] or [[Oracle|oracles]] to command their minions, and the most powerful ones also become [[Mystic theurge|mystic theurges]] to combine their own [[Divine magic|divine magic]] with the [[Arcane magic|arcane]] lore of their collected brains.
> Yah-thelgaads often serve as supervisors of the Dominion's [[Surgery|surgical]] and genetic engineers, pushing them toward horrific procedures. Despite their cruelty, yah-thelgaads seem to feel no emotions of their own, but instead experience them through their stolen brains, preventing enemies from affecting their minds.
