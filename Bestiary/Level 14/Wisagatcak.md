> **Wisagatcaks** are a species of six-legged [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spider]]-like predators native to [[Hell]]. Despite being [[Outsider|outsiders]] and needing no food to survive, they enjoy the taste of flesh and are unusually coordinated when hunting. A wisagatcak has a leg span of five feet, weighs 60 pounds, and can reduce a [[Human|human]] corpse to bones with unsettling speed.
