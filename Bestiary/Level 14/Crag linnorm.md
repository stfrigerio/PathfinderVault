> Like all [[Linnorm|linnorms]], the deadly **crag linnorm** is a powerful, primeval [[Dragon|dragon]] that menaces the northern wildernesses.



## Appearance

> This massive wingless dragon has two powerful forelimbs which it uses to assist in locomotion when it slithers. Its head resembles that of one of the [[Chromatic dragon|chromatic dragons]] with evil eyes, huge jaws, and a large set of gnarled horns. Crag linnorms have long, [[Serpent|serpentine]] bodies that are covered in grey scales and end in three barb-tipped tails. A crag linnorm can reach 60 feet long and weighs nearly 12,000 pounds.


## Habitat and ecology

> Crag linnorms are denizens of the wild regions far north of where most civilizations extend. They are most common in the the country that bears their name, the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. The reason they are so common here is that the land is somehow connected with the mysterious [[First World]] from which the linnorms originate. Favoured by some primal power of the mysterious [[Fey|fey]], any who manage to slay a crag linnorm are forever [[Curse|cursed]], making them exceptionally vulnerable to any sort of fire or heat. The crag linnorm is among the weakest of its kind, but while it may not be as strong as other linnorms, it is still a devastating predator and capable of decimating entire parties of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] with it molten magma breath. Adding to this creature's deadly arsenal, it also has a [[Venom|venomous]] maw that inflicts an agonising, burning [[Poison|poison]] on those it bites.


## On Golarion

> [[Boiltongue]] is possibly the most famous crag linnorm on [[Golarion]]. It was defeated by [[White Estrid]] in [[4704 AR]], and is now her pet and ally.
