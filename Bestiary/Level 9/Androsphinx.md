> **Androsphinxes** appear as gigantic creatures with the lower bodies of [[Lion|lions]], the wings of a [[Falcon|falcon]], and the upper body and head of a male [[Human|human]]. They are similar in this regard to [[Gynosphinx|gynosphinxes]], who have the upper bodies of female humans, and see this other race of [[Sphinx|sphinx]] as their only equals.



## Society

> Considered the most powerful variety of sphinx, androsphinxes are blunt-natured paragons of justice. They enjoy debate, particularly on the topics of [[Philosophy|philosophy]] and ethics, and are willing to barter their permission to pass through their territory in exchange for valuable knowledge.
> Their lairs often resemble the cluttered home of a scholar, littered with [[Book|books]] and academic works, furniture and containers overflowing with folios, and intriguing [[Magic item|magic items]] to research. Their research projects adorn every available surface, and they are known to overspend when acquiring relevant information or materials.


## Ecology

> Like gynosphinxes, androsphinxes are produced solely from the coupling of respectful love between an androsphinx and gynosphinx. Androsphinxes mate with gynosphinxes, and are typically the only recipients of gynosphinxes' desire for companionship.


## On Golarion

> Androsphinxes are known to inhabit the [[Shining Mountains]] along the [[Scorpion Coast]] of [[Osirion]], and have lived in northeastern [[Garund]] longer even than Osirion itself has existed. Some also live in the deserts of [[Rahadoum]], [[Thuvia]], and [[Qadira]], and were once common visitors to [[Iblydos]] for scholarly pursuits. While they are much less common in colder northern climates, their curiosity sometimes drives them to travel when needed.


### In culture

> The [[Androsphinx of Zukebri]] is a monument in the [[Underdunes]] of Osirion that depicts a [[Gem|gem]]-adorned androsphinx wearing a bronze mask of a [[Pharaoh|pharaoh]]'s face. The inanimate statue emits a perpetual [[Psychic magic|psychic]] scream and weeps an unknown black fluid.
> Carvings of sphinxes, including androsphinxes, adorn the pyramid of [[Sekh-pa-Mefer III]] in the [[Parched Dunes]].
> The Desert card of a [[Harrow deck|harrow deck]] sometimes depicts an androsphinx.
