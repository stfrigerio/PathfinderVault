> A **chortov devil** is a towering [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Pig|pig]]-faced [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiend]] with an innate command of [[Hellfire|hellfire]]. Each is clad in eldritch [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] that binds it unwillingly to servitude in [[Hell]].


## Behavior and ecology

> Chortovs are created from unwilling residents of Hell, be they innocent sacrifices in diabolical rites, trapped travelers, or [[Evil|evil]] [[Soul|souls]] destined for torment elsewhere. Over time, these souls become twisted and focused into personifications of rage, hatred, and violence. These fiends corrupt all fire near them into hellfire and explode destructively if slain, and creatures they injure can be infected with their own aimless wrath.
