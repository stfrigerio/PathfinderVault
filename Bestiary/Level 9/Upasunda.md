> Enemies of the distant and mysterious [[Vudra|Vudran]] pantheon almost unknown in [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]], **upasundas**, also known as **beatific ones**, are deadly foes of the [[Divine|divine]], all but unmatched in close combat. Beatific ones are among the most feared [[Asura|asuras]], and exemplify that race's ideal of purity through devotion to destruction.



## History

> The first upasundas were created from the followers of a man who attained godhood through sheer force of will. These [[Mortal|mortals]] sought [[Immortality|immortality]] in jealous imitation of their lord and were ensnared by one of the [[Asura rana|asura ranas]]. The rana granted their desire by transforming them into the first beatific ones.


## Appearance

> Upasundas bear a resemblance to a toned, golden-skinned [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]] woman. They are supposedly paragons of physical perfection, except in place of a normal head, they have one with three faces, each with a similar visage. Each face looks like a woman's face except that they feature large curved fangs. Upasundas also have six arms, each capable of wielding a sharp, deadly Vudran [[Weapon|weapon]].


## Habitat & Ecology

> Upasundas spend most of their time not on the [[Material Plane]] but in the depths of [[Hell]]. They tend to dwell in ziggurat-like lairs. The main drive of a beatific one's existence is to test and torment mortal warriors with their near-peerless mastery of melee. Beatific ones are said to be masters of every type of weapon ever created and know the moves of every martial art. They live to bring low great warriors, test the prowess of heroes and participate in the greatest battles. Upasundas are also known to torture the [[Soul|souls]] of [[Evil|evil]] mortals.
