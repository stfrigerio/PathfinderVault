> A **roc** is an enormous [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|raptor]] dwarfing most [[Humanoid|humanoids]].



## Appearance

> Rocs appear like colossal birds of prey, with a body thirty feet long and a wingspan of over 80 feet; they often dwarf even [[Dragon|dragons]]. Rocs have long, clawed talons and sharp hooked beaks ideal for tearing flesh. They come in a variety of colours including brown, red, black and white.


## Habitat and ecology

> While rocs are equally at home hunting over sea or land, they normally live only in mountainous areas, ideally making their nest upon a crag inaccessible to ground dwellers. These nests are normally made of large trees, rocks, and even chunks of masonry. Rocs are known to dwell amongst the [[Wyvern Mountains]], [[Kodar Mountains]], the [[Fog Peaks]] of [[Avistan]], and even on the barren island of [[Three Hags Rock]] in the [[Ironbound Archipelago]]. They hunt on the [[Nesmian Plains]] of southern [[Nirmathas]]. Rocs only mate once a decade and are highly anti-social otherwise, often even attacking other rocs that venture into their hunting ground. After mating, the female lays a clutch of three to five eggs; the parents then alternate hunting patterns, with one parent always remaining close to the nest. When hunting, rocs normally grab their prey, snatching them skyward before dropping them from a great height and feasting on what remains.
> Despite their vast size, rocs are still just [[Animal|animals]] and can be trained like any other animal; roc eggs can fetch over 4,000 [[Gold piece|gold pieces]] at market. Of course, their vast size makes training rocs incredibly challenging for most [[Human|human]]-sized trainers, however, [[Giant|giants]] face no such problems. Both [[Cloud giant|cloud]] and [[Storm giant|storm giants]] are renowned for keeping rocs as pets and sometimes even using them as flying mounts.


## Variants

> - [[Storm roc|Storm rocs]] live in the [[Storval Plateau]] of [[Varisia]].
> - [[Rukh|Rukhs]] are a species of giant birds closely related to rocs, but resemble vultures more than birds of prey.
