> The **yrthak** is a flying reptilian predator that haunts barren wastelands in search of live prey. It can focus sonic waves into powerful destructive blasts.



## Appearance

> A yrthak resembles a huge spiked [[Pterosaur|pterosaur]] with vast leathery wings, 20 feet from head to tail and weighing 1,500 pounds. Its horned snout is long and narrow with a brightly colored crest on its head. Its eyes are tiny and almost useless.


## Abilities

> The yrthak's signature ability is its ability to emit powerful sonic blasts from its maw in the form of a lance of pure sound that can rend flesh and explode rock and stone. The creature is effectively blind, unable to see anything more than a few feet away, but makes up for it with its ability to "see" by sensing sound and movement. Yrthaks are immune to sonic attacks.


## Habitat and society

> Yrthaks hunt alone or in small clutches of up to six. They are more intelligent than mere beasts and are capable of speaking [[Draconic]], but have no apparent interest in forming societies. Yrthaks are exuberant hunters, wildly blasting their prey with sonic lances. Yrthaks cover wide areas in search of prey, resorting to scavenging only in times of extreme hunger.
> Yrthaks are sometimes eaten by [[Death worm|death worms]], which can leap dozens of feet into the air to grab flying prey.
> Scholars speculate that yrthaks may be related to the strange [[Dragon|dragons]] known as [[Kongamato|kongamatos]].


## On Golarion

> Yrthaks have been encountered in the mountains of [[Katapesh]], the [[Kortos Mounts]] on the [[Isle of Kortos]], on [[Mount Rinia]] in [[Cheliax|Cheliaxs]] [[Menador Mountains]], and [[Nirmathas]] near [[Glimmerhold]].


## On Other Worlds

> Yrthaks are not restricted to [[Golarion]], and can be also found on [[Triaxus]].


## Variants

> A fur-covered, black-and-white-striped subspecies known as the **boreal yrthak** inhabits the arctic wastes of the [[Crown of the World]]. It emanates a glowing blue and green aura of electricity that blurs its form and makes it difficult for prey to detect in flight, but also hinders its ability to hide on the ground.
