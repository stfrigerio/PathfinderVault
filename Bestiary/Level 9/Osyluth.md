> **Osyluths**, also known as **bone devils**, are [[Hell|Hells]] interrogators and torturers.



## Appearance

> Standing nine feet tall, an osyluth appears like a withered, skeletal corpse with insectile features and a long, bony tail ending in a wicked barb. It has only vestigial wings, but can fly regardless through magical levitation. Many osyluths carry fearsome weapons made of bone, not for combat but for intimidation or torture.


## Habitat and society

> Osyluths are often selected from the ranks of the most manipulative [[Erinys|erinys]]. These chosen are buried, drowned, and picked over by the swarming scavengers of foul [[Stygia]] for 200 years. Assuming it survived the experience, the new osyluth that emerges loses all of its former beauty in exchange for other considerable powers.
> Osyluths serve as Hell's inquisitors, monitoring other [[Devil|devils]] and keeping order among the ranks. They are also vicious torturers who treat the torment of damned [[Soul|souls]] as an art. They enjoy being [[Magic/Conjuration|conjured]] to the [[Material Plane]], where they have ample opportunity to collect information for their infernal masters. In Hell itself, osyluths congregate in calcified hives where they extract knowledge and secrets from those they torture.


## Abilities

> In addition to the weakening [[Poisons of Golarion|poison]] injected by their tail stingers, osyluths radiate an aura of bone-chilling fear and possess numerous magical abilities. These include the abilities to fly, turn invisible, [[Teleport|teleport]] and limit other creatures' teleportation, create [[Illusion|illusions]], conjure walls of ice, and summon other osyluths.
