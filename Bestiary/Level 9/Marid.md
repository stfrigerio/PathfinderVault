> This article might have further canon details available on **[[httpsstarfinderwikicomMarid|StarfinderWiki]]**.


> **Marids** (pronounced mah-RIDD) are a race of [[Genie|genies]] from the [[Plane of Water|Elemental Plane of Water]]. Noble marids are called **shahzadas**.



## Appearance

> A marid has blue-green skin, deep blue eyes, flamboyant eyebrows, and pearlescent teeth. Marids stand around 16 feet tall and weigh nearly 2,500 pounds, and are said to have the strength of oceanic currents.


## Ecology

> Marids are capable of producing [[Undine|undine]] offspring with [[Humanoid|humanoids]] in the [[Material Plane]].


## Society

> Marids claim to be the rightful rulers of the entire Plane of Water before the Material Plane even existed, but have been fractured for ten millennia, since the [[Elemental lord|elemental lord]] [[Kelizandri]] killed their last padishah, Niloufar, and destroyed their empire's capital city of Arzanib. However, the marids seem uninterested in fighting Kelizandri's constantly expanding domain, and some scholars believe that the empire was actually destroyed by [[Kraken|krakens]] who infiltrated marid society, something that the marids refuse to acknowledge. The disparate marid petty kingdoms regularly vie for power and have little to do with each other otherwise; convincing them to cooperate is notoriously difficult.
> Marids are the most capricious species of genie, something which others of their kind (especially [[Shaitan|shaitans]]) find aggravating and embarrassing. Many become [[Art|artists]], and search for an audience in the Material Plane.
> In order to facilitate peace between one other, marids follow strong rules of hospitality, making them one of the most accessible races for visitors to the Plane of Water. They enjoy guests, particularly performers and traders, and sometimes go out of their way to encourage them. Their cities often provide food and air to foreigners, but trade is infrequent due to the lack of roads.
