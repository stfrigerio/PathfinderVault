> **Leukodaemons** (pronounced LOO-koh-day-mon), or **pestilence daemons**, are the deacons of [[Disease|disease]], emissaries of [[Apollyon]], the [[Four Horsemen|Horseman of Pestilence]]. Native to [[Abaddon]], they come to [[Golarion]] to scour the lands, spreading disease, and claiming [[Soul|souls]] in the name of their master.


## Appearance

> Leukodaemons are roughly humanoid in form, and stand approximately 14 feet tall. Numerous features betray their otherworldly origins, such as hoofed feet, filthy black wings, and a bleached skull where one would expect the head to be. Servants of disease and decay, a leukodaemon's flesh appears tattered and infested by both sickness and parasites; swarms of flies follow the creature constantly.


## Ecology

> Though capable of quickly devastating entire regions with the plagues they carry, leukodaemons find a perverse enjoyment in watching the sick suffer; the deacons of disease prefer to let a contagion grow and spread on its own, as they watch from the shadows. When not carrying out the will of their master, leukodaemons can be found inhabiting the [[Plaguemere]], a swamp surrounding the [[Throne of Flies]], the seat of power of the Horseman of Pestilence.
