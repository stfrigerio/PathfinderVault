> **Gorgoroses** are a race of [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] with the ability to turn nearly anything to stone with their petrifying gaze.



## Appearance

> A gorgoros appears as a serpent-headed beast with multiple tails and three yellow glowing eyes. It measures 15 feet in length and weighs 6000 pounds.


## Abilities

> A gorgoros' gaze turns victims to stone permanently. Creatures that succumb to its horrific appearance find their eyes drawn to the its gaze, unable to avert or close their eyes. With their stone-altering magic, gorgoroses can reshape battlefields or resculpt petrified foes, which they use as material for twisted [[Art|artistic]] endeavours. While gorgoroses require no sustenance, they enjoy feeding on their statues. Rumour has it that the daughters of those who survived a gorgoros' gaze are born with petrifying gazes and [[Serpent|serpents]] for hair; this might have been the origin of [[Medusa|medusas]].


## Ecology

> The cyclopean pillars made of black stone scattered around [[Yad Iagnoth]] are honeycombed with tunnels where gorgoroses make their home and welcome intruders hungrily.
