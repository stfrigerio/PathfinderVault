## Ecology

> Mokele-mbembe are usually solitary [[Animal|animals]], but when prey is abundant they may gather in groups of three to four males and one to two females. Females choose their mates based on their strength and size and on how much food they bring to them, and after mating lay clutches of five to six eggs; mated pairs raise their young together. The female guards the nest for the first month after hatching while the male brings back food, after which the young follow their parents on hunts until they are three or four months of age, at which point, they become largely independent.
> Mokele-mbembe are powerful predators capable of hunting prey such as water buffalo and other predators such as [[Leopard|leopards]] and [[Crocodile|crocodiles]]; they are especially known for their violent clashes with [[Hippopotamus|hippopotamuses]].


## On Golarion

> Found in the most remote tropical rivers and lakes across [[Garund]], mokele-mbembe are most often encountered in the jungle interior. The Julanga tribe of [[Zenj]] along the River Still not only hunt the creatures, but also pray to them and consider their hides and skulls sacred, and oppose any outsiders who hunt mokele-mbembe. [[Lizardfolk]] of the Shell-Bearer tribe near the Buunta Flow also protect a pack of mokele-mbembe from poaching by [[Aspis Consortium]] agents of [[Nightfall Station]]. A population of mokeles lives in the deep waters of [[Lake Ocota]], which they share with numerous [[Water orm|water orms]], and their reclusive habits have led to the development of a number of myths about their nature.
