> **Aurumvoraxes** are powerful, eight-legged, [[Cat|cat]]-like predators with golden fur who dig extensive tunnel complexes and seem to enjoy the taste of metals (especially gold). They are known among the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] as **golden gorgers** because of the coloring of their fur and their unusual appetites.


## On Golarion

> Aurumvoraxes are generally found in [[Golarion|Golarions]] more temperate zones, and have been seen on the island of [[Deepmar]] off the coast of [[Cheliax]], along [[Varisia|Varisias]] [[Lost Coast]], on the [[Nesmian Plains]] of southern [[Nirmathas]], and in the [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] region known as the [[Stolen Lands]]. Although most comfortable in cooler climes, the creatures have also been spotted near sources of water in the highlands of [[Katapesh]].


## In the Great Beyond

> The [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] [[Arqueros]], who commands [[Heaven|Heavens]] first line of defense, Prime Vallation, is said to be served by a host of [[Celestial|celestial]] aurumvoraxes.
