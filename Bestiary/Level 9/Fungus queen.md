## Fungus Queens in Golarion

> Fungus queens are sadly not exclusive to the Darklands; they also dwell in the [[Demon|demon-overrun]] realm of the [[Worldwound]]. They dwell in [[Frostmire Fen]], where they congregate near the sulfurous hot springs and are led by the most powerful fungus queen of [[Golarion]]: [[Enivuni]].
