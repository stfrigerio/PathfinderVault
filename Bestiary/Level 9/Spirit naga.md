> **Spirit nagas** are a race of [[Naga|naga]] outcasts shunned for their dark powers and loathsome ways.



## Appearance

> A typical spirit naga is slender, with the scales of a venomous [[Serpent|serpent]] and greasy hair framing their pale faces. Most measure 14 feet long and weigh less than 300 pounds.


## Ecology

> Spirit nagas see their innate [[Magic|magical]] talents as evidence of their status as the inheritors of some mysterious dark favour. Most commune with powers of death and devastation, work profane rites, and seek grotesque auguries from cults. Spirit nagas have an [[Magic/Enchantment|enchanting]] gaze, turning victims into fanatics and sacrifices.
> Spirit nagas inhabit places of death and destruction, especially those imbued with corruption like crypts of tyrants or ruins of nefarious castles.


## Society

> Spirit nagas sometimes band together in small groups, mimicking [[Hag|hag]] covens. However, they are loyal to none other than themselves and these alliances always end in betrayal.


## On Golarion

> Skull-masked spirit nagas lurk in the cremation pits of Geer Pharas in [[Vudra]], stealing corpses about to be immolated. Spirit naga [[Witch|witches]] also serve as the totems, teachers and ritual memory of the Night Sashes, a [[Slayer|slayer]] academy. In [[Kaer Maga]], spirit nagas walk the streets openly alongside [[Dark naga|dark nagas]], and the two races are colloquially known as wormfolk.
