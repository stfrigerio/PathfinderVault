> The **tyrant jelly** is an intelligent [[Ooze|ooze]] using an immature insect as a primitive brain.


## Ecology

> Tyrant jellies are the result of a strange reaction that sometimes occurs between an [[Ochre jelly|ochre jelly]] and a queen egg which it consumes when infiltrating a colony of giant bees or [[Wasp|wasps]]. With its unusual powers over arthropods, the tyrant jelly quickly takes control of the colony, sending workers to gather food to sate its unnatural hunger. Other [[Vermin|vermin]] are attracted to their scent and then fall under their sway, so a colony often has multiple arthropod species working together.
> A tyrant jelly might be reasoned with via [[Magic|magic]] or [[Telepathy|telepathy]], and is willing to cooperate with those who pay it in food. Some insect cults hunt tyrant jellies, believing their substance has properties similar to a giant bee's royal jelly, or can increase the intelligence of vermin.
> Slashing [[Weapon|weapons]], piercing weapons, and electricity attacks can force an ochre jelly to split from the tyrant jelly. The ochre jelly is under the tyrant jelly's control, and can be re-absorbed by it.
