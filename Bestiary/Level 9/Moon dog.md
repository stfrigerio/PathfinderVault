> **Moon dogs** are a race of nomadic [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|dog]]-like [[Outsider|outsiders]] who roam in packs and patrol [[Nirvana]].



## Appearance

> A moon dog resembles a sleek, white-furred hound with hand-like paws and a preternaturally wise face. Moon dogs can stand erect and wield [[Weapon|weapons]] if desired, but they prefer the speed and mobility of quadrupedalism. Most moon dogs stand approximately five feet tall and weigh about 125 pounds.


## Ecology

> Moon dogs roam Nirvana and hunt planar menaces where they please. Their hunts sometimes take them to the [[Astral Plane]], the [[Ethereal Plane]], or more rarely the [[Material Plane]]. More often than not, they enter the Material Plane to fight [[Evil|evil]] outsiders plaguing innocent [[Mortal|mortals]].


## Society

> Moon dogs prefer the company of their own kind and do not mix with other outsiders, but are willing to ally with them, serving as scouts and wise councillors.
