> The **jyoti** are a race of winged, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird-like]] creatures native to the [[Positive Energy Plane]]. Though some assume that because they reside in a place that is the source of all the life energy in the [[Great Beyond]], that they would be [[Good|good]]. The truth is that are quite xenophobic, and generally attack any visitors to their home, especially those who serve a [[Deity|deity]].



## Appearance

> Jyoti appear as radiant glowing [[Humanoid|humanoid]] birds.


## Ecology

> Jyoti spontaneously form from the Positive Energy Plane's [[Planar essence|raw essence]]; they neither reproduce nor age.


## Society

> Jyoti dwell in living cities made of towering, radiant crystals. They are xenophobic and defend their cities from all invaders, especially those that serve the [[Deity|gods]] or come from different [[Plane|planes]]. Jyoti claim that they were appointed to be protectors of their plane and cultivators of unborn [[Soul|souls]]; who actually appointed them is unknown (some scholars equate this with the Logos, if the 'appointment' actually happened in the first place), and their activities keep the [[River of Souls]] constantly flowing. They sometimes agree to hold dangerous [[Artifact|artifacts]] for visitors, but those with religious significance usually end up destroyed by the jyoti, and are never returned to their owners, due to the jyoti's distrust of the divine.
> Jyoti have a strange relationship with [[Turul|turuls]], another race of avian outsiders native to the Positive Energy Plane. Some believe the two races to be different incarnations of the same genesis, with others going a step further to suggest turuls represent a higher form of reincarnation than jyoti. Neither turuls nor jyoti speak of the matter, and both hypotheses are just that. A single turul might rarely dwell at the centre of a jyoti city, serving as a protector and advisor even though jyoti pay little attention to them, and adopt the jyoti's attitudes towards outsiders and deities. These arrangements and attitudes are temporary, lasting at most a century, and might be the result of a bargain wherein a turul agrees to become part of a jyoti community, living by their rules for a period in return for something the turul covets.
> [[Manasaputra|Manasaputras]] temper the instinctive xenophobia of jyoti, and both races respect each other, although jyoti do not actively seek out manasaputras to interact with. Jyoti despise the [[Danava|danavas]] that came to the Positive Energy Plane, seeing them as meddling by the gods in the jyoti's task; their presence in the Positive Energy Plane might have been the cause of the jyoti's hatred of the gods.
> Jyoti despise [[Negative energy|negative energy]] and everyone that tries to harness it. Their relationship with [[Sceaduinar|sceaduinars]] is complicated: while the sceaduinars are a taboo topic among jyoti, and hearing that very word can rouse their rage, jyoti also view their [[Negative Energy Plane]] counterparts with pity, and consider their destruction a mercy.


## Stars

> The xenophobia of jyoti is manifested in the guard duty undertaken by members of their race within [[Star|stars]] of the [[Material Plane]]. The majority of stars surround [[Portal|portals]] to the Positive Energy Plane, and groups of jyoti choose to stand guard over these [[Portal|portals]], preventing access from the Material Plane to their home plane.
