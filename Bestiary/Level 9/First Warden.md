> **Warden** [[Robot|robots]] are massive [[Technology|technological]] guardians of important sites, vaults, or prisoners, that zealously execute their programming by ruthlessly killing intruders, often without warning. Wardens are intelligent [[Construct|constructs]] that coordinate attacks when acting in groups, using their sonic and light weapons in concert to overwhelm their foes' senses.


## Appearance

> Wardens are hulking metal constructs with squat bodies, two flexible legs, and two long arms with six dexterous fingers on each hand. The [[Technic League]] has a particular interest in warden robots' reactive armor, which responds to impacts with fiery explosions and regenerates this ability over time.


## Habitat & Society

> Wardens can be found across [[Numeria]], but most known wardens defend [[Silver Mount]], where the [[Technic League]] has had some success subverting them for their own use. Their programming allows them to quickly adapt to enemy tactics and work together in small groups. While capable of speaking [[Androffan]], wardens communicate with each other through some unknown silent means.
