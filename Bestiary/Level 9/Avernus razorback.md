> **Avernus razorbacks** are a species of [[Boar|boar]]-like [[Outsider|outsiders]] native to [[Avernus]], the first level of [[Hell]].



## Appearance

> An Avernus razorback resembles a massive ebon boar with crimson patches on its coarse fur, blood red eyes, and jagged obsidian-like tusks.


## Ecology

> The exact origin of Avernus razorbacks is debated. Some argue that the beasts are the manifestation of Avernus' malice; others argue they are descendants of [[Daeodon|daeodons]] brought from the [[Material Plane]] to drink from the [[River Styx]] and eat the reeds in the ocean [[Eridanos]] and, consequently, became infused with the essence of Hell.
> Avernus razorbacks are omnivorous and capable of eating almost anything, preferring meat (especially that of intelligent prey), consuming the flesh and [[Soul|soul]] alike. Unlike normal boars, they are active predators, and will become less ferocious if they do not regularly eat meat.
> Avernus razorbacks roam Hell in large herds that even [[Devil|devils]] give a wide berth. They are most common on Avernus and rarer in deeper layers, especially [[Nessus]], whose boundaries are tightly guarded by the [[Nessian warhound|Nessian warhounds]] of [[Asmodeus]], who consider Avernus razorbacks pests. Each herd is led by a strong alpha female, who constantly has to battle for dominance with other females; males are usually so aggressive and voracious that they regularly bring ruin to a pack that they have claimed. Members of a herd regularly mate, giving birth to young after four months. Adult females generally have to protect the piglets from hungry adult males, and are incapable of producing milk: Avernus razorback piglets have to hunt from birth.
> Avernus razorbacks reproduce significantly more slowly outside of Hell. Many devils attribute Eridanos or the River Styx to be the catalyst of their reproduction, although some [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemists]] claim that they can artificially reproduce this catalyst.


## Society

> Avernus razorbacks are usually too unruly to be domesticated, and only kept by brave or foolhardy citizens of diabolic nations like [[Cheliax]] to get rid of enemies without leaving evidence or the chance of resurrection. Rumour has it that some Avernus razorbacks have escaped into the Chelish wilderness, but no evidence for such a herd has been confirmed.
> The blood, meat, and tusks of an Avernus razorback can all be harvested for special use: the tusks can be crafted into [[Dagger|daggers]], the meat is prized as a delicacy and [[Drug|drug]] in Cheliax, and the blood keeps some of the soul energies of the prey and can be used in blood sacrifices.
