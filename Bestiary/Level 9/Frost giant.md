>  **Frost giants** are a generally [[Evil]] race of massive [[humanoids]] with white or blue-tinged skin, and stand close to 15 feet in height, weighing roughly 2,800 pounds. As they are impervious to cold, they tend to frequent [[Avistan's]] northern latitudes. They are particularly common in the [[witch]] realm of [[Irrisen]] and near the [[Crown of the World]].



## Ecology

>  Frost giants are among the most feared of the [[giants]], as they are highly aggressive, prone to blood-lust, and very fond of raiding. They prefer attacking from surprise, and are quite adept at blending into their snowy environment. They prefer launching small boulders at their targets until they run out of ammunition, then switch to their massive [[greataxes]].


## Habitat and society

 [[Amiri]] battles a frost giant.
>  These giants live almost entirely by raiding and hunting. Roughly half of their population lives in small nomadic bands or tribes, while the rest settle down in abandoned castles or caves. They are known to often ally with fearsome [[winter wolves]] and, though they tend to dominate such alliances, frost giants must be careful not to antagonise their lupine allies as they have been known to tear giants that upset them limb from limb.


### Holvirgang

>  The only known frost giant city is actually a fortress: [[Holvirgang]], located in the far north of Irrisen. Built into the side of a glacier, it houses approximately 300 frost giants, and close to 1,000 other creatures of various races.
