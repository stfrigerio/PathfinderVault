## In Andoran

> Avorals are seen as a living embodiment of freedom by the people of [[Andoran]]. These creatures are held in high regard within the nation; a story commonly told by the nation's inhabitants, *[[The River Bird Catcher]]*, describes the meeting of one of these [[Outsider|outsiders]] and [[Duke Lapist]], leader of a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] encampment. The avoral [[Talmandor]] is the [[Celestial|celestial]] patron of Andoran, and popular history suggests Talmandor dictated the text of the seminal tract *[[On Government]]* to [[Darl Jubannich]].
