> **Foxes**, like the common **red fox**, are smart [[Animal|animals]] that hunt live prey, also commonly serving as [[Familiar|familiars]] for [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]], especially among [[Gnome|gnomes]] and [[Human|humans]].



## Variants


### Arctic fox

> **Arctic foxes**, or **white foxes**, are common familiars in cold climates. It is especially stealthy in snowy environments due to its white fur.


### Fading fox

***Main article: [[Fading fox]]***
> Fading foxes are a breed of fox originating from [[Taldor]]. They were bred by the nobility to provide particularly challenging quarries and are known for both their extreme cunning and their ability to alter the color of their pelts to blend in with their surroundings. However, these qualities have also made them very problematic pests for Taldor's peasantry.


### Firefoot fennec

***Main article: [[Firefoot fennec]]***
> Firefoot fennecs are closely related to foxes, but are smaller and have individual coloring.


## Relations with other creatures

> The [[Fey|fey]] race of brownies are known to distrust foxes for an unknown reason.


## Fur trade

> Some hunt foxes for their fur, which is then traded widely. Fox fur is one of the many types of fur traded around the [[Shining Sea]] where fur trading is the largest industry. Furs are locally used for clothing and even shelter. The finest pelts, especially those of white foxes, get shipped to the more profitable markets of the south.


## Fox-like creatures

> Although [[Kitsune|kitsune]] are shapeshifters, their base form is that of a vulpine [[Humanoid|humanoid]], with a fox-like head, human-like hands that end in claws, and a large, bushy tail. They look very similar to [[Vulpinal|vulpinal]] [[Agathion|agathions]], although the latter are smaller and with even more fox-like features than the kitsune.
