>  **Frogs** are small, hopping amphibians with strong legs and long, sticky tongues. Certain kinds produce highly [[toxic]] compounds within their skin; these **poison frogs** are usually distinguishable by their brightly colored skins. Poisonous frogs are often referred to as **spear frogs**, referring to the manner in which their toxins are often used to coat thrown [[weapons]] such as [[spears]] and [[daggers]]. While all frogs are amphibious, certain kinds spend less time in the water and are more adapted for climbing lifestyles.



## Giant frogs

>  **Giant frogs** are enormous relatives of common frogs with razor-sharp teeth, and can grow in excess of six feet in length and 200 pounds in weight. They are sometimes taken as [[animal companions]]. Even larger variants are known, such as the **goliath frog**.
