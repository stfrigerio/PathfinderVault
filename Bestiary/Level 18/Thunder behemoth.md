## Ecology

> Thunder behemoths are driven solely by an all-consuming hunger for living creatures, ore, and buildings alike. They are the behemoths of choice when it comes to destroying a single nation, for while devastating, they are bound to the land itself and cannot easily move across the globe. The days before a thunder behemoth arrives are fraught with minor but unnerving earthquakes, mass exoduses of burrowing [[Animal|animals]] to the surface, and an increase in fallen trees and sinkholes.
