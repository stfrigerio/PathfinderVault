> **Krakens** are huge, [[Squid|squid]]-like aquatic creatures.



## Appearance

> A typical kraken's body can be up to 100 feet in length and weighs 4,000 pounds. In appearance, the body of a kraken resembles that of a giant squid, with a ring of tentacles surrounding a mouth connected to a central body. Two of its tentacles are longer than the rest and bear deadly hooked barbs. A kraken has very large eyes and fins that jut from the upper part of its body.


## Ecology

> Krakens have been known to attack [[Boat|boats]] and even some of the world's largest [[Ship|ships]]. Despite their simplistic appearance, they actually possess advanced intellects and even speak [[Languages of the Great BeyondAquan|Aquan]], or a language of their own, similar to that of a [[Whale|whale]].


## On Golarion

 A kraken attacks a ship on the high seas.
> In [[Rova]] [[4700 AR]], the eyeless bodies of thirteen krakens washed up on the [[Isle of Kortos]]. There have been reports that a mighty kraken sometimes hunts near the whirlpool of [[Devil's Drain|Devils Drain]] between [[Dragon's Rib|Dragons Rib]] of the [[Ironbound Island]] and the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Southmoor]].
> The [[Tian Xia|Tian Xian]] nation of [[Wanshou]] came under the control of the kraken [[Zhanagorr]] when he quelled a devastating typhoon that hit its shores shortly after the fall of [[Lung Wa]], naming rulership of Wanshou and its people as his price for doing so.


## In the Great Beyond

> Large numbers of krakens are native to the dark depths of the [[Plane of Water]], where they have long been in conflict with the native [[Brine dragon|brine dragons]] for dominance of the [[Plane|plane]]. Despite their intelligence and power, the krakens' lack of organization has allowed the [[Dragon|dragons]] to expel them from the depths as their own power and holdings grew, forcing the krakens into the plane's lighter waters. This has forced many krakens to enter into begrudging alliances with other races, often installing themselves as advisors to [[Marid|marid]] and [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] rulers. While the krakens find such alliances demeaning, they hope to forge the disparate [[Genie|genie]] and sahuagin nations into stable empires once again, preferably ones heavily reliant on kraken support.
