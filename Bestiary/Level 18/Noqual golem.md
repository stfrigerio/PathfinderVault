> **Noqual golems** are powerful magical [[Construct|constructs]] made of the rare [[Skymetal|skymetal]] [[Noqual|noqual]]. Even though they are magical creations themselves, the anti-magic nature of the metal is enhanced in these creatures, making them exceedingly hazardous to any kind of spell or dweomer.


## Noqual Golems in Golarion

> Only one noqual golem is known to exist on Golarion and it is owned by the [[Technic League]] of the [[Numeria|Numerian]] city of [[Starfall]]. Created by a former League member, the powerful [[Wizard|wizard]] [[Furkas Xoud]], the golem is said to serve as a fail-safe should the League's technology fail. The [[Cyphermages]] of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Riddleport]] have recently acquired a large supply of noqual thanks to a local meteorite strike, and are said to be working on a noqual golem of their own.
