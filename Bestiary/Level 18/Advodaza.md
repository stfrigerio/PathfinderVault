> **Advodazas**, also known as **false gods**, **fallen demagogues**, and **nemesis devils** are the surviving remnants of the ancient and wicked spirits worshipped by mortals in the distant past. These spirits have been transformed and bound to [[Hell]] as fiends of blasphemy and idols.


## Appearance

> Each advodaza looks unique, but they typically have the anthropomorphic monstrous appearance of its former worship, including bestial or [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centauric]] forms with wings, hooves, claws, and fangs. Advodazas retain the idols and talismans of their worship as [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]], [[Weapon|weapons]], or jewelry. These devils usually reach a height of 18 feet and a weight of almost nine tons.


## Habitat & Ecology

> As the remnants of ancient fetishes and demi-deities, advodazas have sought the power of Hell to return them to a position of worship. They universally seek to return to the [[Material Plane]] to seduce mortals to worship, sacrifice, and engrave idols to them. As ancient spirits not solely crafted by Hell itself, they are extremely rare.
