> **Phylacators** are a type of [[Velstrac|velstrac]] that serve as jailers, torturers, and executioners.



## Appearance

> The skin of a phylacator is midnight blue, hairless, and has the texture of rough-hewn stone. Their eyes are steel-gray and lack pupils. Phylacators stand seven feet tall and weigh approximately 350 pounds. They often wear black [[Armour|armour]] and writhing manacles as belts, and wield a serrated [[Flail|flail]].


## History

> Phylacators claim to have exploited the weaknesses of the prison of the velstracs in [[Hell]] and facilitated their exodus to the [[Shadow Plane]]. Because of this and their intimate knowledge of prisons, they were chosen as wardens of [[Xovaikain]], the prison of [[Zon-Kuthon]], and have maintained an absolute vigilance for ages.


## Ecology

> Phylacators are familiar with the suffering of imprisoned [[Mortal|mortals]] and are capable of provoking maddening desperation among them. They sometimes mislead a particularly intelligent prisoner into thinking that they have found a way to escape, letting them plan for years before catching and torturing them for entertainment and as a warning for others.
> Phylacators can form bonds with the prisons where they serve, holding a thorough knowledge of all chambers, passages, locks, bars, and the habits of their colleagues.
> Every night, a phylacator must remove its armour and sit in an [[Iron|iron]] chair, a spike-covered dull metal throne, to shed its blood in tribute to Zon-Kuthon. This device is often secluded or hidden in plain sight.
> Since phylacators are often responsible for keeping prisoners alive, they usually use brutal and efficient non-lethal tactics like knocking foes to the ground with their flails or throwing their magically animated manacles to incapacitate them.


## Society

> Unlike other velstracs who tolerate its use, phylacators loathe the use of the exonym *kyton* for their species; they insist on the use of the endonym *velstrac* instead. Anyone calling their species *kyton* after being corrected once will deeply anger any phylacator.
> Phylacators can be bound to high-security prisons in the [[Material Plane]] as jailers, as long as the prison holds at least 100 [[Good|good]] or [[Chaos|chaotic]] creatures and the corpses of those executed under the phylacator's jurisdiction are given over to it. A phylacator serves willingly for at least a year, or more if the prison population is larger or if it is given more sadistic authority.


## On Golarion

> Most phylacators on [[Golarion]] serve [[Evil|evil]] dictators or cults, notably the [[Nidal|Nidalese]] government. A few non-evil employers secretly use them to lock away dangerous criminals: the church of [[Abadar]] staunchly denies rumours of a phylacator being employed by their taxmasters beneath [[Oppara]].
