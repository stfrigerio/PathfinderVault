> **Shoggoths** are said to have been around for eons. Legends also claim that, when compared to any other [[Ooze|oozes]], shoggoths have much greater wisdom. Shoggoths were once the servants of dark powers, but cast off their masters after centuries of mistreatment. Sages believe that [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]] might be their creators, but this is incorrect: the [[Elder thing|elder things]], an even more ancient race, were behind their existence, and uprisings of shoggoth slaves who develop intelligence have been the doom for countless elder thing colonies.



## Appearance

> Shoggoths have no distinct form. They change it to fit the situation as need be, having arms, tentacles, or any other form that might help them to catch and consume their food. Their flesh is mostly black and sometimes translucent, and gives off a very faint luminescence. A shoggoth has no permanent mouth, but it can create and absorb mouths as needed.


## On Golarion

> These horrors exist in the deepest, darkest reaches of the oceans or in the remotest ruins and caverns, such as islands in the [[Sightless Sea]]â€”cults of the [[Great Old One|Great Old Ones]] maintain that shoggoths take the the waters of the sea to sing their insane songsâ€”the [[Black Desert]], and [[Ilvarandin]] in the the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Orv]]; in far-flung ancient ruins; or in the service of monstrous [[Old Cults]] of the [[Dark Tapestry]].


### Known shoggoths

> - The ancient Gibbering Blot of Palamia.

## On distant worlds

> Within the [[Solar system|solar system]], shoggoths have also been seen near the south poles of [[Aucturn]] and [[Akiton]].
