> A **ghost** is the [[Spirit|spirit]] of a [[Mortal|mortal]] creature whose [[Soul|soul]] cannot, or will not, leave a specific location in the [[Material Plane]] and travel on to the [[River of Souls|afterlife]] due to its tragic death or lack of closure. Their restless spirit haunts their site to try to make right the untoward circumstances â€” real or perceived â€” of their death.
> Each ghost retains the [[Alignment|alignment]] of their mortal form, making them a rare form of potentially non-[[Evil|evil]] [[Undead|undead]].
