> **Manasaputras** are a race of [[Celestial|celestials]] from the [[Positive Energy Plane]] who guard the plane while they seek to perfect themselves and achieve oneness with the universe; they also help [[Mortal|mortals]] achieve the same.



## Appearance

> Most manasaputras are formless entities forged of the Cosmic Fire from the heart of the Positive Energy Plane. When a manasaputra takes a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] form, it is usually resplendent and idealised, often with striking features that clearly set it apart from mortals.


## Ecology

> Manasaputras are formed from the fusion of the [[Soul|souls]] of the unborn and the potential of those who have learned from lifetimes of reincarnation. They are benevolent entities that follow strict practices of contemplation, introspection and meditation. Though accepting towards new ideas and challenges, a manasaputra can take millennia to adapt to them as they incessantly evaluate the changes to their ideals.


## Society

> Manasaputras are ostensibly led by the [[Manasaputra kumara|manasaputra kumaras]], though each operates as an individual. More powerful manasaputras mentor younger ones, similar to a monastic hierarchy. Lesser manasaputras have deep respect and reverence for greater ones and their phenomenal power.
> Manasaputras welcome visitors and often teach them spiritual maturation and enlightenment. Against [[Evil|evil]] on the [[Material Plane]], manasaputras rarely intervene directly, preferring to teach mortals to better face these challenges. Against great cosmic-level threats concerning the destruction of knowledge or fomenting disorder, dozens of manasaputras might directly work together with [[Aeon|aeons]] and [[Inevitable|inevitables]].
> Manasaputras respect the cosmic balance brought by the aeons, as well as inevitables' determination to their tasks. They are unable to share the passion of [[Agathion|agathions]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Culture/Races/Azata|azatas]], and are often put off by the zeal of [[Archon|archons]] and [[Angel|angels]], except [[Movanic deva|movanic devas]], [[Monadic deva|monadic devas]] and [[Astral deva|astral devas]], who often also oversee mortal affairs. They temper the instinctive xenophobia of [[Jyoti|jyoti]], and both races respect each other. Their sworn enemies are [[Sahkil|sahkils]], who attempt to hold back mortal development. They rarely interact with evil mortals outside the path of enlightenment, and see them mostly as obstacles to be overcome.
> The greatest manasaputras seek out the wisdom of the Logos, a presence sometimes equated with the [[Aeon|aeons]]' [[Monad]] or whomever tasked the jyoti with their guardianship of souls. Only the manasaputras discuss this subject with others, in the form of personal quests designed to guide scholars to their own conclusions.
