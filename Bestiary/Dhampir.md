> **Dhampirs** are the [[Curse|cursed]], mortal progeny of [[Vampire|vampires]]. They are sometimes termed **half-vampire** or, more cruelly, **half-dead**.



## Description

![[Larsa.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Larsa]], an [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] dhampir [[Investigator|investigator]]
> Most dhampirs are tall and slender, possessing physical grace and unearthly beauty. While eye colour, skin hue, and hair colour resembles that of the mother, they also possess a ghostly pallor which people find unnerving. They tend to move with unworldly fluidity, and have a piercing gaze. Finally, all dhampirs possess elongated incisors, a trait passed down from the vampiric progenitor.
> Regardless of their heritage, dhampirs are still mortal creatures, although their aging process slows down to the rate comparable to that of [[Elves|elves]].


## Adventurers

> Outsider status combined with supernatural abilities make dhampirs natural [[Adventurer|adventurers]]. [[Magic]]-using dhampirs are often undead-bloodline [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]], [[Wizard|wizards]] of the [[Necromancy|necromancy]] school, or occasionally [[Oracle|oracles]] or [[Witch|witches]]. Self-sufficient dhampirs might be rogues or [[Swashbuckler|swashbucklers]], and those who seek to destroy undead might choose [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/champion|champion]] or [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|ranger]].


## Ecology

> The origin of dhampirs is still a point of debate and discussion among scholars. Some believe that they are result of relations between a [[Human|human]] woman and a male vampire, while others speculate that they are born of women who are bitten by a vampire while pregnant. Still others believe that they are a unique race of humans who suffer from an unholy affliction of some sort. Whatever the truth might be, dhampirs have a very hard time reproducing themselves, and their progeny are always human (often with [[Sorcerer|sorcerous]] abilities).
> Usually rejected and mistrusted for its lineage, a dhampir is rarely accepted into normal society. Most grow up as orphans, as few mothers survive birthing the young dhampir, and most have difficulty forming real relationships with others in spite of their unnatural charm and grace. Ultimately, most dhampirs feel the pull to [[Evil|evil]], or at least moral ambiguity, and view those around them as tools and pawns. A handful have been known to reject this, however, vowing to destroy the [[Undead|undead]] horrors responsible for their conception.


## Dhampir heritages

> Most of the dhampirs encountered in the [[Inner Sea region]] are related to the common vampire, also known as the [[Moroi|moroi]], but since there are other, related vampire species around the world, there are also other varieties of dhampirs.

[[Jiang-shi-born|Jiang-shi-born or Ru-shi]]
The Ru-shi are the indirect offspring of the terrifying [[Jiang-shi|jiang-shi]] vampires, most commonly found on the continent of [[Tian Xia]]. They are generally mechanically gifted but avoid all physical contact with others.
[[Moroi-born|Moroi-born or Svetocher]]
These dhampirs are the direct progeny of the charming [[Moroi|moroi]] vampires, the most commonly encountered vampiric race found in the Inner Sea region.
[[Nosferatu-born|Nosferatu-born or Ancient-born]]
The unnatural offspring of humans and the dessicated [[Nosferatu|nosferatu]] vampires, ancient-born inherit their parent's wasting condition, and often harbor a deep hatred of humanity. They are most-commonly found in [[Ustalav]].
[[Vetala-born|Vetala-born or Ajibachana]]
Ajibachana are the children of the [[Vetala|vetala]], the vampires of [[Vudra]]. They are quite dexterous and fond of scholarly pursuits.
