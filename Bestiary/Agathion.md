> **Agathions** (pronounced a-GATH-ee-ons) are a race of [[Celestial|celestials]] with [[Animal|animal]] characteristics native to [[Nirvana]], the [[Plane|plane]] embodying [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|goodness]] unconcerned with [[Law|law]] or [[Chaos|chaos]]. They defend the realm of Nirvana and meditate on its deeper mysteries.



## Appearance

> All agathions bear the characteristics of a particular animal species. Some appear [[Humanoid|humanoid]], while others are nearly identical to true animals. Certain animals, particularly scavengers or parasites, specifically have no associated agathions, as their habits and ecological niches clash with the traditions of those who seek enlightenment. Agathions take pride in their bestial aspects and do not like to be compared to mere talking animals or [[Werecreature|werecreatures]]; indeed, to suggest that an agathion's appearance is a punishment is one of the worst insults one could level at the species.


## Ecology

> Agathions are created from [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] who have successfully achieved enlightenment, whether in life or after death, and were rewarded with a form suiting their talents and personality.


## Habitat

> Agathions can be found everywhere across Nirvana. They are free to travel wherever they wish, but understand their roles well and serve where they are most needed. Unless [[Summon|summoned]] elsewhere or when there is an opportunity to aid [[Mortality|mortals]], agathions rarely leave Nirvana; when they do, they prefer idyllic countryside but are willing to live in cities if required by the situation. When incognito in the [[Material Plane]], agathions often counsel prisoners, hoping to lead them to redemption. Many mythologies tie numerous humanoid species with animalistic aspects to the result of [[Human|humans]] forming strong emotional attachments to agathions. In between these visits, they return to Nirvana to revel in its beauty and to find solace.
> Agathions also send representatives to [[Pharasma|Pharasmas court]] to help mortal souls reach a more enlightened state.


## Society

> Agathions are usually regarded as wise and mysterious, full of aphorisms and animal-themed metaphors. Agathions embody the principles of mutual respect, but are ferocious when defending themselves and their allies from [[Evil|evil]]. They do not remove themselves from mortal affairs, and are aggressive when dealing with evil in the mortal world.
> Agathions easily understand good and evil, view goodness as the only path worth pursuing, and see the dichotomy between law and chaos as unimportant. Because of this, they make natural arbiters between other celestials, and frequently make common cause between [[Archon|archons]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Culture/Races/Azata|azatas]], who in turn often view their arbitration concerning conflicts between law and chaos as fair and reasonable. However, agathions sometimes have difficulty understanding their lawful or chaotic kin.
> Agathions view souls who suffer without respite or recourse as the worst evil. To them, imprisonment is the most heinous punishment, especially when a mortal is imprisoned by evil, like children raised in despair, or people corrupted by [[Magic|magic]] or forced to turn to evil as a last resort. Such individuals are viewed as trapped, unable to even follow the path of good and redemption, and are most likely to draw agathion attention.
> Agathions never try to enforce their will on others and have no formal hierarchy, but usually follow the teachings of a powerful agathion [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] who has been granted far greater power by the plane itself, and who is believed to have been one of the first [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Soul|souls]] to have reached Nirvana. Agathions do not restrict their service to [[Neutral good|neutral good]] [[Deity|deities]] or empyreal lords, and perform good deeds where they believe necessary.
> As well as contemplating the nature of Nirvana, each of the agathion races have their own specific roles from guardians to messengers to [[Bard's End|bards]].
