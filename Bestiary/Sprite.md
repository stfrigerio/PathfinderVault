> **Sprites** (or luminous sprites) are primitive, diminutive [[Fey|fey]] who live in forests. They rarely get taller than nine inches, weighing up to two pounds. Sprites choose to defend nature; however, not all recipients for their protection want or need it. They are distrustful of all other creatures, including other fey. They are curious about [[Magic|magic]] and some sprites are receptive to becoming a spellcaster's [[Familiar|familiar]].


## Adventurers

> Sprites are most often [[Bard's End|bards]], [[Rogue|rogues]], or [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]], though sprite [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]] and [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] do exist and tap into their love of nature. Similarly, sprite [[Witch|witches]] and [[Wizard|wizards]] are even more enthusiastic about learning the secrets of magic, and sprite [[Oracle|oracles]] approach the contradictions of their mystery from the experience of living the contradictions between the fey and mortal worlds.
