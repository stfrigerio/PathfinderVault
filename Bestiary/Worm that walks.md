> A **worm that walks** is a writhing mass of worms that forms the shape of a [[Spellcaster|spellcasting]] creature.



## Appearance

> A worm that walks is a mass of worms formed into the shape of whatever dead spellcaster the worms originally fed upon. Although worm-based variants are the most common, others can be composed of other forms of [[Vermin|vermin]], such as locusts, [[Wasp|wasps]], [[Ant|ants]], and [[Cockroach|cockroaches]].


## Habitat and society

> A worm that walks forms sometimes when an [[Evil|evil]] spellcasting creature is buried in earth infused by [[Magic|magic]]. The worms that feed on the corpse consume the spellcaster's [[Soul|soul]], and gain a hive mind that retains the memories and magical abilities the corpse had in life.


## Abilities

> A worm that walks shares many of the traits of insect swarms, having no vulnerable organs and no discernible "front" and "back". Its unique composition makes it very resistant to [[Weapon|weapon]] damage. It normally forms in the shape of the corpse, but if necessary it can split itself up into a mass of worms (for instance in order to swarm onto an opponent).
> However, it is not a mindless collection of vermin, and can call upon the spellcasting power the original corpse possessed in life.


## On Golarion

> The nature of a worm that walks means it can form spontaneously wherever the appropriate conditions are found. However, several of these creature are known to serve the [[Neothelid|neothelids]] of [[Denebrum]], and lead [[Seugathi|seugathi]] forces in the [[Ilvarandin]] district of [[Aumentral]] against the neothelid's [[Intellect devourer|intellect devourer]] foes.
