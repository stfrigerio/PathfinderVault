> **Ants** are eusocial insects that live in large underground colonies.



## Ecology

> Ants are highly eusocial insects and live in large groups, which inhabit underground hives either burrowed out by the insects or formed from preexisting caves. Ants are divided into a number of biological castes, including workers, warriors armed with stings, winged drones that seek food sources, and a queen. Ants are omnivores, and feed on both [[Fungus|fungus]] grown within the hive and on [[Animal|animal]] prey.


## Variants


### Army ants

> Army ants move in large swarms, forming living carpets of insects that seek to devour all in their paths.


### Giant ants

> Giant ants closely resemble their smaller relatives in appearance and behavior, but can grow to the size of [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|ponies]].


## In religion

> Ants are the sacred animals of the [[Nascent demon lord|nascent demon lord]] [[Izyagna]] and the [[Harbinger|harbinger]] [[Cixyron]]. They are also among the favored animals of [[Zon-Kuthon]].
