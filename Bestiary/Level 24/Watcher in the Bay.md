> The **Watcher in the Bay** is a sea monster that features in the local legends of the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] town of [[Illmarsh]]. Thought to be a superstition by the mayor Early Greedle, the Watcher is real: it is a manifestation of the [[Outer God]] [[Shub-Niggurath]] in [[Lake Encarthan]].
> The Watcher in the Bay appears as an horrific five-armed cephalopod with preternaturally good vision and a [[Lamprey|lamprey]] mouth. It measures nearly 60 feet from mouth to tentacle tip. Its very presence inflicts intense mental anguish and torment on all creatures nearby; its thoughts can drive anyone that interacts with them [[Insane|insane]]; and it can swallow its enemies whole, thereafter transforming them into loyal [[Mutant|mutant]] minions that regard it as their mother.
