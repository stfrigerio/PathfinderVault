> **Velstrac-spawn**, or **shackleborn** or **kyton-spawn** as they are sometimes called, are [[Tiefling|tieflings]] who are descended from [[Velstrac|velstracs]].



## Appearance

> Most of a shackleborn's flesh is usually scarred by the time they are born, and many add to those mutilations over time.


## Behavior

> As descendants of velstracs, shackleborn share their progenitors' cruelty and affinity for pain, both their own and inflicting it upon others. They also share velstracs' aptitude with torture instruments and chains.


## On Golarion

> Shackleborn are most common in [[Cheliax]] and [[Nidal]], and are also rumored to serve as â€” or are bred to be â€” torturers in [[Razmiran]].
