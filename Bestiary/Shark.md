> **Sharks** are a group of [[Fish|fish]] found throughout the seas of [[Golarion]] characterized by pectoral fins and five to seven gills on the sides of their head. Dangerous predators, they have evolved over the eons into the perfect, aquatic killing machines.



## Species of shark


### Angustiden

> **Angustidens** are very large sharks native to deep waters. They are only exceeded by [[Megalodon|megalodons]] in size, and are known to prey on great white sharks.


### Blue shark

> **Blue sharks** inhabit the warmer oceans of the world, although they sometime migrate to cooler waters, and can be quite aggressive.


### Bull shark

### Great white shark

> **Great white sharks** are among the largest species of normal shark found on Golarion, and have a reputation of being fierce man-eaters.


### Hammerhead shark

> This larger species of shark has a noticeably hammer-shaped head.


### Helicoprion

> **Helicoprions** are peculiar sharks with lower jaws ending in whorls of teeth. These can be flicked out against prey, and recoiled to trap targets in a spiral of shredding teeth. Once a potential meal has been captured, a helicoprion keeps it trapped and waits for it to succumb to its injuries.


### Jigsaw shark

***Main article: [[Jigsaw shark]]***
> Jigsaw sharks are a smaller species of shark found off the coast of [[Varisia]]. They generally grow between five to eight feet in length, although some larger specimens have been spotted.


### Megalodons

> Also known as **dire sharks**, **megalodons** are a true terror of the seas. Their enormous size (they can grow over 60 feet long and weigh upwards of 100,000 pounds) gives them the ability to be a threat to even the largest [[Ship|ocean-going vessels]].


### Sharks of Lake Nirthran

> Sharks are not only found on Golarion's surface waters. A species of giant bioluminescent shark is said to inhabit the deeper regions of [[Lake Nirthran]] in the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Sekamina]].


### Tiger shark

> This large and aggressive shark gets its name from the dark stripes over its body.


## Ecology

> One would think that sharks are top predators, but Golarion's oceans, rivers, and lakes are dangerous enough that this is not the case. Of note are the giant shark-eating crabs that grow to be the size of a small hut, and the clever shapechangers known as [[Selkie|selkies]], both of which can be found in the cold waters off the coasts of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. Another creature with a taste for shark meat is the sea snail-like [[Incutilis|incutilis]].


## On Golarion

> Although hundreds of species of shark can be found off nearly any coast on Golarion, they seem to be particularly common in the [[Shackles]]. One of the largest islands in the archipelago is even named [[Shark Island]]. Jigsaw sharks and great whites are frequently spotted off the [[Lost Coast]] of Varisia, Even the cold waters of the [[Steaming Sea]] are home to aggressive shark species, such as the ones found off the city of [[Bildt]] in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. The gargantuan megalodons have been spotted in the waters off the [[Ironbound Archipelago]], the [[Antarkos Ocean]], and the coasts of Varisia.
> Sharks are not only denizens of the sea, but can also be found in Golarion's rivers and lakes. These include the rivers near the settlement of [[Outsea]] in the [[River Kingdoms]], and [[Claybottom Lake]] in Varisia.


### Domestication

> Intelligent aquatic races have been known to domesticate sharks for hunting or guard duty. An example of this can be found in the city of [[Absalom]], where the local [[Gillman|gillmen]] have begun training them to serve as bloodhounds to track escapees from the prison known as the [[Black Whale]]. Undersea [[Storm giant|storm giants]] sometimes train larger shark species to serve as mounts or beasts of burden. Shark-like themselves, [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] commonly domesticate these [[Animal|animals]]. Sharks are also sometimes taken as [[Animal companion|animal companions]] by water-breathing or sea-dwelling [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] and [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]].


## Shark-like creatures

> Quite a few of Golarion's species have shark-like features, most often because of [[Magic|magical]] experimentation and breeding, although this seems to not always be the case. These include the [[Wereshark|wereshark]] and their distant descendants, the [[Skinwalker|skinwalkers]] known as [[Seascarred|seascarred]]. Inscrutable shark-men called [[Kaneano|kaneano]] live near [[Ilizmagorti]] on [[Mediogalti]], and may be related to the fearsome and [[Evil|malevolent]] [[Adaro|adaro]]. The intelligent [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] are often referred to as being like sharks, but whether this is primarily because of their features, their ability to naturally communicate with them, or their predatory nature is hard to gauge. However, [[Feeder in the depths|feeders in the depths]] are sharks infused with malevolent power and intelligence by the sahuagin. One of the most bizarre shark-like creatures is the [[Lusca|lusca]], gargantuan magical monstrosities with three shark heads and the tentacles of an [[Octopus|octopus]]. Much smaller, but still terrifying, are [[Bunyip|bunyips]], who combine the features of both sharks and seals. On land, burrowing [[Bulette|bulettes]] look so similar to sharks that they are commonly known as landsharks.


### Beyond Golarion

> Like with many other creatures of the natural world, [[Extraplanar|extraplanar]] versions of sharks exist in the [[Great Beyond]]. These include [[Fiendish|fiendish]] sharks that inhabit the waters of Tharsekti, the [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]] nation on [[Lamashtu|Lamashtus]] realm of the [[Abyss]]. Other powerful beings have or take on the shapes of shark, such as the [[Nascent demon lord|nascent demon lord]] [[Ovonovo]], who claims all sharks under his areas of concern.


## Sharks in magic

> Both sharks and megalodons can be [[Summoned|summoned]] for short periods using druidic magic, while their fiendish or [[Celestial|celestial]] counterparts can be brought forth using [[Arcane magic|arcane magic]].
