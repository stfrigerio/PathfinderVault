![[Kolyarut.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A [[Kolyarut|kolyarut]] inevitable.
> **Inevitables** are a family of living machine [[Aeon|aeons]] created by [[Axiomite|axiomites]] in the eternal war against [[Protean|proteans]] and the forces of [[Chaos|chaos]].



## Appearance

> Most inevitables resemble [[Humanoid|humanoids]] made of stone, [[Metal|metal]], and [[Jewel|jewels]]. They are forged by axiomites and often look like moving works of [[Art|art]]. They are aware of how they inspire awe, and usually choose to speak in a steely, booming voice to ensure obedience.


## Origins

> In ages past during [[Axis]]'s expansion, its inhabitants entered into agreements with [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] that solidified its [[Great Beyond|multiversal]] neutrality between the two moral extremes of [[Good|good]] and [[Evil|evil]]. Immediately opposing this were two [[Keketar|keketar]] [[Protean|proteans]] and a third, unknown albino type of protean, who called Axis an "infection" and demanded that it cease to exist.
> Although Axis prepared for war, the cataclysm that happened in its stead devastated the city. [[Plane|Planar]] [[Portal|rifts]] tinted blue like the [[Maelstrom]]'s depths rent Axis' walls and spilled hordes of [[Demon|demons]] into the city of cities, causing widespread destruction. In response, Axis devoted some of its axiomites to crafting a defensive force, which led to the first inevitables.
> A council of [[Pleroma aeon|pleroma aeons]] recently revealed that axiomites were prodigal aeons that broke free from the Monad, an aeon [[Demigod|demigod]] that claims to represent the underpinning of all realities, in order to pursue acts of creation. By extension, the council claimed that inevitables had always been agents of aeons in their eternal war against imbalance. Most, but not all, axiomites and inevitables have joined forces with aeons as a result.


## Ecology

> Inevitables are created for the purpose of enforcing the laws of reality and society. Each inevitable's existence is driven by a conceptual jurisdiction to be enforced. They have no ambition and cannot be swayed by bribery, but are sometimes willing to offer light sentences in exchange for aid against greater crimes. They have no gender and little sense of self.
> Although they look like [[Construct|constructs]], inevitables are living [[Outsider|outsiders]] that nonetheless enjoy many benefits of a constructed form: they are never tired, hungry, nor [[Diseases of Golarion|sick]].
> The frames of inevitables are forged in the [[Adamantine Crucible]] of Axis. [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|Petitioners]] in Axis that solve the riddles inscribed on their bodies are granted permission to enter the Adamantine Crucible and bond with one such frame to become inevitables. Most only retain fragmentary memories of their past life, which influence their new personality.


### Unshackled

> Inevitables can become corrupted as the result of [[Chaos|chaos]] suffusion or possession by [[Pelagastr|pelagastrs]], becoming chaotic creatures known as **unshackled**.


## Habitat

> Inevitables are almost always encountered singly on the [[Material Plane]] except when gathered into a force by the commands of their creators. When operating alone, they attempt to correct [[Mortal|mortals]]' chaotic ways and use various methods to push them into making amends. In extreme cases, inevitables back this up with forceâ€”even lethal force. Some inevitables regularly return to Axis to receive new orders, while others are ordered to operate at their own discretion across a large territory.
> Some inevitables remain on Axis, where legions of inevitables regularly battle against the [[Maelstrom]] in an eternal attempt to bring order to the chaotic realm; these inevitables are termed the Bulwark. Others, called Seekers, analyse axiomites' observations and dispatches about the mortal world. Between assignments, they establish homes in Axis or wander the planes to pursue a broader mandate.


## Society

> Inevitables are guided by an unspoken hierarchy: the more powerful an inevitable, the higher its rank. When two cross paths, they also take into account the immediacy and severity of each one's mission to determine primacy; if necessary, a powerful inevitable might defer to a lesser one. Inevitables never clash with each other. Axiomites exist outside this hierarchy, and inevitables respect and are absolutely loyal to their creators, although the two races operate more as partners instead of master and servant.
> Inevitables have little culture or desire to make friends, and their relationships are strictly professional. They often rely on local mortals (like local authorities, [[Adventurer|adventurers]], or followers of lawful [[Deity|deities]]), unless these mortals are part of the problem or informing them could ruin the mission. Inevitables rarely compel service and might even pay those who lie outside the hierarchy of Axis.
> Outside of axiomites, [[Aphorite|aphorites]] and certain deities' servants, most outsiders do not work well with inevitables. [[Angel|Angels]] and [[Agathion|agathions]] are put off by their stoic, strict adherence to the letter of the law, while [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]] find their zeal and interference upsetting. [[Archon|Archons]] and [[Devil|devils]] are willing to work with them but disagree with how inevitables exact punishment. On missions that demand speed, inevitables often ride on mighty aekrakarshis.
> Inevitables regularly teach mortals how best to honour order, but know that mortals are imperfect, and aim to improve behaviour or [[Magic|magically]] compel it, trusting that their students will never meet their standards.


## Primordial inevitables

***Main article: [[Primordial inevitable]]***
> The first inevitables are the [[Demigod|demigods]] known as [[Primordial inevitable|primordial inevitables]]. Most primordial inevitables have been destroyed in cosmic disasters, and the axiomites have lost the ability to build them, so the surviving ones are seen as living treasures by normal inevitables, to be protected at all costs.
