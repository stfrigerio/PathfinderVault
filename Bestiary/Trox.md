> **Trox** are a race of arthropodal [[Monstrous humanoid|monstrous humanoids]] native to the [[Liavara|Liavaran]] [[Moon|moon]] [[Nchak]].



## Appearance

> The original trox on Nchak were eight-legged [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|arachnids]], though the variant found outside Nchak are arthropodal [[Humanoid|humanoids]], their two central sets of limbs atrophied, their muscle allocated to their legs, upper arms and fleshy tail; their natural exoskeletons enhanced and their mandibles expanded into bony scythes.


## History

> The trox were originally a peaceful race of burrowers. Long ago, an incarnation of Nchak's ruling [[Forever Queen]] selected a contingent of trox for the task of interplanetary expansion. The explorers were [[Magic|magically]] altered into their humanoid form, then divided and ensconced in the centre of shepherd moons, which were then ejected out of Liavara's orbit.
> One of these [[Asteroid|asteroid]] [[Spaceship|ships]] reached [[Golarion]] and dug down to the [[Darklands]], near a [[Duergar|duergar]] city. The duergar wasted no time in [[Slavery|enslaving]] the emerging trox, and bred them for strength and brutality. After a few generations, the hulking trox were bound to their masters by fear and pain, and memories of their ancestral home faded. Over time a few isolated groups have escaped captivity, and several clans were able to reach the surface world, whose residents were just as eager to enslave them.


## Society

> Free trox tend to be reclusive and xenophobic and can harbour deep grudges and resentment, but are inquisitive and deeply loyal to those who show them kindness.
