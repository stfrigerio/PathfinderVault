> **Crawling Hunger** is one of the lesser [[Spawn of Rovagug]].


## Appearance

> It is described as the largest [[Purple worm|purple worm]] ever witnessed, standing out due to the crab-like legs that sprout from the length of its body. These legs protrude in all directions, allowing it to grab food from its body to pass up to its ever-hungry mouth.


## History

> It emerged from the [[Pit of Gormuz]] at an unknown point in history. However, unlike its greater brethren, it does not choose to range farther abroad. Instead it dwells in Offal Mountain within the Pit, leaving only when [[Summoned|summoned]].
> A follower of [[Rovagug]] can summon the Crawling Hunger using *[[Planar ally|planar ally]]*. When summoned in such a way, it requires a gift of at least half a dozen sizable creatures to consume to secure its obedience. Alternatively, [[Magical item|magical items]] that create food or remove the need to eat can be an acceptable sacrifice, though its inexhaustible hunger will overwhelm their [[Magic|magic]] and digest them within a few days. If the summoner does not provide such sacrifices, the Crawling Hunger will immediately consume them as a substitute.
