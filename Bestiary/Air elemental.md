> Composed of pure air and as mercurial as a storm's wind, **air elementals** are at home on the [[Plane of Air|Elemental Plane of Air]] but can also be found on [[Golarion]] wherever wind is at its most intense.


## Appearance

> Air elementals are comprised of pure air, and resemble clouds that have coalesced into a stronger, more definable form, with facial details appearing as darker hollows. Air elementals assume a bewildering variety of forms and can appear as a cloud-like version of any mortal creature, although they prefer  forms of creatures that can fly naturallyâ€”from [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]] to [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Level 1/Bat|bats]] to [[Dragon|dragons]]. Some remain in what scholars believe to be their natural form: a whirling vortex of cloud or smoke that resembles a miniature whirlwind. And while an air elemental can look like a creature, such as an eagle, it certainly does not have the creature's complex internal make-up.


## Habitat and ecology

> Air elementals dwell for the most part on the Elemental Plane of Air, where they soar carefree through the endless azure skies. While they are often summoned by [[Wizard|wizards]], [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]], and other [[Magic|magic]] users, most resent the intrusion and long to fly through their home [[Plane|plane]] again. Some, however, relish life on the [[Material Plane]], finding themselves inherently drawn to the wonders of the world: dancing across windswept deserts, and frolicking around the pinnacles of the highest mountains. They are often attracted to strange geographical features where air interacts differently with the land, such as the [[Painted Flutes]] in [[Katapesh]]. Air elementals are somewhat averse to the ground, finding the need to move only in two [[Dimension|dimensions]] stifling and preferring to attack flying foes if given the choice. Interestingly, air elementals can move through water without drowning as they have no need to breathe, but doing so greatly reduces their maneuverability.
