*See also: [[Ape]]*
>  **Monkey** is the name given to any of a number of species of smaller primates who inhabit [[Golarion's]] warmer forests. They are very social [[Animals]] that spend most of the day looking for food.



## Monkey swarms

>  Monkeys sometimes congregate in large groups of hundreds of individuals. In such numbers, they can be quite dangerous if threatened.


## Monkey species

>  A large number of species are classified as monkeys, including the ones listed below:


### Baboon

***Main article: Baboon***
>  Baboons are larger monkeys known for their short tails, large, canine-like teeth, and aggressive nature. They live either in warm-climate forests or plains.


## Monkey-like species

>  Quite a few creatures on Golarion bear some resemblance to monkeys, including the [[Humanoid]] [[vanaras]] of distant [[Vudra]].


## Monkey magic

>  Monkeys are the inspiration of numerous [[magical]] abilities:


### Animal focus

>  [[Hunters]] are known to be able to take on various animal aspects, or apply them to their [[animal companions]], including that of a monkey. Adopting this aspect grants the person or animal increased climbing ability.


### Familiars

>  Monkeys are frequently taken as [[familiars]] by spell-casters. The magical connection between the two increases the master's nimbleness when the monkey is nearby.


### Monks of the Four Winds

>  Certain advanced [[monks]] known as Monks of the Four Winds can take on a monkey aspect. Doing so transfigures the monk's face into that of a monkey, makes her more whimsical and playful, allows her to grow a prehensile tail, and to become a great climber.


## Screaming Jungle

>  Some claim that the [[Mwangi Expanse's]] [[Screaming Jungle]] gets its name from the countless vocal monkeys that inhabit its jungle canopy.
