> When the link between an [[Eidolon|eidolon]] and its [[Summoner|summoner]] is somehow destroyed, or in some cases when an eidolon is crafted from other [[Outsider|outsiders]], the eidolon is free to act and roam the [[Material Plane]] independently. Such an eidolon is known as an **unfettered eidolon**.
> An unfettered eidolon is no longer connected to its home realm, often resulting in madness. The runes that once represented their bonds become burning scars. Despite the severed connection, an unfettered eidolon can continue to evolve on its own.
