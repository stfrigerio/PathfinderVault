> **Stingrays** are a species of [[Ray|ray]] that can be found in both freshwater and marine environments. They are normally passive creatures, and bury themselves in sand, mud, or aquatic vegetation. However, they also possess [[Poison|poisonous]] stingers in their tails, and are prone to lashing out with these when startled or stepped upon.
> Stingrays are sometimes taken as [[Animal companion|animal companions]].
