> **Aeon wyrds**, sometimes called **ioun wyrds**, are wily [[Construct|constructs]] made of small [[Gemstone|gemstones]], lodestones, granite, and [[Alchemical|alchemical]] materials, designed as [[Familiar|familiars]] and conduits for *[[Aeon stone|ioun stones]]*. A typical aeon wyrd resembles an [[Earth elemental|earth elemental]] or [[Paracletus|paracletus]], roughly two feet in diameter and weighs 15â€“20 pounds. It must be constructed with at least one functional *ioun stone*, and its *ioun stones* can be swapped out by any creature it trusts. The aeon wyrd's master benefits from its *ioun stones* (the aeon wyrd itself never does). Wild aeon wyrds that escaped their masters have been seen in [[Nex]] and [[Thuvia]] and seek out pretty stones, which they consider to be related to themselves.
