> An **homunculus** is a [[Cat|cat-sized]] [[Construct|construct]] that looks like a winged [[Devil|devil]]. For the most part, they are created by [[Wizard|wizards]] as [[Familiar|familiars]] and to aid them in their work and research. A homunculus is made from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, spring water and, most importantly, one pint of blood. The person supplying the blood is considered to be the construct's creator (and hence its master), even if other people were responsible for sculpting the body mixture and casting the [[Spell|spells]] required to animate it.



## Ecology

> As artificial creations, homunculi do not require food, water, or air to breathe. They are intimately tied to their masters, and though they cannot speak, they can communicate via a mental link. Because of this close bond, the destruction of a homunculus causes its creator grievous harm. Likewise, the death of its master causes a homunculus to go utterly insane.


## Homunculi in Golarion

> The [[Pathfinder]] [[Wystron Telfyr]] is one of [[Golarion]]'s most prolific creators of homunculi, as are the mages at the [[Golemworks]] in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]].
> The [[University of Lepidstadt]] is one of the world's leading authorities on homunculi, though recently the creation of the Homunculi of Lepidstadt has been banned for ethical reasons. However, some creation may occur in private, and sometimes with the aid of [[Alpon Caromarc|Count Alpon Caromarc]].


## Variant Homunculi

> Methods exist by which more advanced homunculi can be created or basic varieties improved, such as breath weapons and spellcasting capabilities. The University of Lepidstadt has been in the forefront of such research, which involves complex [[Alchemy|alchemical]] procedures.
> Certain high-ranking members of the death-cult known as the [[Whispering Way]] are known to possess [[Undead|undead]] homunculi, but the secrets of their manufacture have not been revealed.
