> **Wisps**, sometimes spelt **wysps**, are five tiny spherical races of [[Elemental|elemental]] beings, each corresponding to an [[Element|element]]: **aether wisp**, **air wisp**, **earth wisp**, **fire wisp**, or **water wisp**.



## History

> The first wisps were aether wisps, spawned by the same convergence that created the [[Aether|aether]] element. These aether wisps roamed the [[Ethereal Plane]] and [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]] freely until the [[Elemental lord|elemental lords]] discovered their value as minions and bred them into new types.


## Abilities

> All wisps share a handful of common abilities, though the nature of the abilities change slightly from element to element. For example, all wisps resonate with the energies of their element, empowering similarly aspected powers and abilities. Wisps that care deeply for those they have resonated with can sacrifice themselves to give their life force to their ally to soften the blow of imminent damage.


## Ecology

> Wisps are curious and intelligent, even in [[Slavery|slavery]]. Free wisps are playful and carefree, with mild differences between the elements: aether wisps are shy and mysterious, air wisps are capricious, earth wisps are wary, fire wisps are impetuous, and water wisps are nurturing. Wisps freely offer their support to creatures who show them kindness. Free wisps quickly become fast friends, especially with wisps of different elements, shunning the hostility normally present between elementals of differing aspects.


## Wisp conductors

> Wisps roam their home [[Plane|planes]] and the [[Material Plane]] in symphonies led by exuberant **wisp conductors**, who are often [[Bard's End|bards]], and playing the otherworldly [[Music|music]] of their resonances. Wisps happily offer services to allies, though generally only [[Elemental|elementals]], [[Kineticist|kineticists]], and [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] can make good use of them. Most wisps do their best to support allies, even willing to give their lives to help them. Some fire wisps view [[Fire elemental|fire elementals]] as masters, even though the elementals barely pay attention to them.
