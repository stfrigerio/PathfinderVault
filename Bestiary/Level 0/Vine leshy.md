 A vine leshy verdivant.
> **Vine leshys** are a species of free-willed, individualistic [[Leshy|leshy]] with a particular connection to [[Mortal|mortals]].



## Appearance

> Vine leshys have bodies made of twisted vines and leaves, and optionally fruits and flowers depending on the species of vine used in their construction. Most have round eyes, a small mouth, no visible nose, and a face framed by a large cluster of leaves.


## Ecology

> Vine leshys grow best in areas with enough [[Sun|sunlight]], and once they sprout, they must be given support (usually a sturdy tree) in order to grow. The nature spirit that inhabits a vine leshy is always one particularly influenced by mortals. Vine leshys made from poison ivy carry natural [[Poison|poison]] in their bodies, while those made from grape vines can produce [[Magic|magically]] infused fruit to [[Healing|heal]] allies.


## Society

> Compared to other leshys, vine leshys more easily relate to non-[[Plant|plants]] and are relatively curious about them and their societies. Being leshys, they have no family structure. They form strong friendships with companions who adventure with them or help them protect natural sites.
> Vine leshys are likely to be nomadic (unlike the other, sedentary leshys), protect multiple wards during their lives, and are usually inclined to seek out their creators, whom they see as friends instead of parents. They love storytelling and focus on the meaning and message rather than the details, which they consider unnecessary and hard to remember. A story transmitted through multiple vine leshys usually retains only the core message, not the details.
> Vine leshys initially judge other races through memories of their past incarnations, but this can change over time. In unfamiliar situations, they usually hide in vegetation and observe before showing themselves.
> Unlike other leshys, vine leshys are not grown to be servants. Some vine leshys consider this servitude [[Slavery|slavery]], while others view it as an honourable tradition; they might either take other leshys as minions or sponsor and guide them like wayward children, protecting them from servitude.
> Vine leshys do not fear death, knowing that their spirits will remain and might find a new body if their current one is destroyed. As a result, they usually take risks, but not particularly excessive ones. Vine leshys do not have a single name, and frequently rename themselves as they age and accumulate experiences. A vine leshy may even have several names at once among which they cycle.

### Religion

> Vine leshys usually follow the [[Green Faith]] but consider religion relatively unimportant. Faithful ones usually worship [[Gozreh]], a [[Green man|green man]], or an [[Eldest]].
