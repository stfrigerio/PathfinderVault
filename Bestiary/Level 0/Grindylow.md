>  **Grindylows** are aquatic creatures resembling a [[Goblin]] from the waist up and an [[Octopus]] from the waist down. Despite the resemblance, they are not considered to be [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Human|humanoids]].



## Appearance


 A grindylow attacks a band of [[adventurers]].
>  Like goblins, a grindylow has a large, grotesque head and many teeth and two arms with fingers. However, its head has a vague [[Shark]]-like resemblance and gills, and instead of legs it has six tentacles resembling those of an octopus. While most grindylows are about four feet tall, there is no limit to their potential growth, and a few rare grindylows have grown to massive sizes.


## Abilities

>  Grindylows can eat almost any living creature, and take pleasure in wreaking pain and chaos. They can wield [[weapons]] in their hands and entangle foes in their tentacles.


## Habitat

>  Grindylows can dwell in many aquatic areas, and they are known to infest regions from the tropical islands of the [[Shackles]] all the way north to the ice-rimmed reaches of the [[Ivory Sea]] fringing the [[Crown of the World]].


## Society

>  Grindylows are indiscriminately violent and rapacious, and will attack settlements of [[Merfolk]] and [[humans]] alike, as well as [[ships]] passing through their territory. While some travel in small groups, others form tribes of several dozen led by [[rangers]], [[clerics]], or [[barbarians]]. Some are known to post skeletal trophies of their prey as "shepherds" near their territory.
>  In much the same ways as goblins hate [[horses]] or [[dogs]] and domesticate [[goblin dogs]], grindylows abhor [[squids]] of all sizes and consider them freaks of nature, while revering [[octopuses]] and [[Devilfish]] as beautiful creatures and befriending them as companions.
