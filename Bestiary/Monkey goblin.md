> The **monkey goblins** of [[Mediogalti]] are a regional variant race of [[Goblin|goblin]], highly adapted to living in the high, jungle canopy of their tropical homeland. They live in the treetop "city" of [[Ganda-Uj]]. Scholars believe that the current site is the fifth lair to bear the name; the other four were accidentally burned down by the fire-loving goblins.
> The goblins delight in attacking travellers, using nets and [[Poison|poisoned]] darts to capture prisoners to be presumably sacrificed to whatever [[Demon|demons]] the goblins worship. Many travellers consider it best to travel through monkey goblin territory in large, well-armed groups.
