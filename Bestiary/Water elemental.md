> Entities of living, homogeneous water, both fresh and marine, **water elementals** originate from the [[Extraplanar|extraplanar]] oceans of the [[Plane of Water]]. Most resemble autonomous waves with vague faces and joined to smaller masses of water resembling arms, but it is not uncommon to see one in the shape of an aquatic [[Animal|animal]] such as a [[Fish|fish]].
