![[Deep_one_hybrid.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A deep one hybrid: the spawn of a deep one and a human.

> **Deep ones** are a race of intelligent ocean-dwelling [[Monstrous humanoid|monstrous humanoids]] with a [[Fish|fishy]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Frog|froggy]] appearance. They regularly mate with surface dwellers, creating societies of [[Deep one hybrid|hybrids]].



## Appearance

> Deep ones are lumbering humanoids with grey-green, glistening hide and a fishlike maw. Deep ones prefer to fight with their claws. A deep one typically stands about seven feet tall, but its hunched gait and lumbering stance can make it look shorter. An average deep one weighs 300 pounds.


## Ecology

> Deep ones are equally at home in remote oceanic trenches and in the shallows alike, but prefer to build their cities in vast submerged canyons unusually close to coastlines. This proximity allows deep ones to breed with surface-dwelling [[Humanoid|humanoids]], which they do as a way to spread their blasphemous religion above the waves.
> Deep ones can use [[Wand|wands]] and [[Staff|staves]], which are often created by those deep ones that pursue [[Magic|magical]] study.
> Deep ones do not age, are [[Immortal|immortal]] unless killed, and are unaffected by magical ageing. A few deep ones never stop growing over the eons and become known as **elder deep ones** or, sometimes, **deep one elders**. Elder deep ones ascend to the status of quasideities, gaining the ability to grant [[Spell|spells]] to followers. Many deep one elders claim the names of monsters or [[Deity|gods]] for their own, with two of the more legendary ones being **Mother Hydra** and **Father Dagon**.


## Society

> Deep ones are fanatically religious and usually worship an [[Outer God]] or [[Great Old One]], most commonly [[Cthulhu]]. Deep one settlements that contain a deep one elder instead typically venerate the elder, who in turn serves an [[Elder Mythos]] deity. Many deep ones become [[Cleric|clerics]], inciting religious fervour and promoting their chosen deity as the greatest among the Elder Mythos. The less devout deep ones, like [[Oracle|oracles]], still worship the Mythos as a whole.
> Some deep ones worship the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Dagon]] in addition to Cthulhu, blending the traditions of both into a singular faith.


## On Golarion

> Rumour has it that deep ones inhabit many of [[Golarion]]'s oceans, especially the [[Arcadian Ocean]]. Individuals corrupted by deep ones are most commonly found in remote communities living near the sea; they also exist in [[Absalom]], [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]], as well as certain [[Cheliax|Chelish]] and [[Nidal|Nidalese]] cities.
