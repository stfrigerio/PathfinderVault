> The term **fiend** or **fiendish** is used to describe creatures, places, or ideas originating or influenced by forces from [[Outer Sphere]] [[Plane|planes]] of [[Evil|evil]] [[Alignment|alignment]], also known as the [[Lower plane|lower planes]]. This includes [[Demon|demons]] of the [[Abyss]], [[Devil|devils]] of [[Hell]], and [[Daemon|daemons]] of [[Abaddon]]. It is also used as a general term to describe anything deemed abhorrent, degenerate, or corrupted.



## Types of fiends

> The term "fiend" most often refers to various races of [[Outsider|outsiders]] devoted to the cause of [[Evil|evil]]. The following categories of creatures are considered fiends.

[[Asura]]
The living blasphemies known as asuras are born from the mistakes of the gods and seek to sow doubt and discord among mortals.
[[Daemon]]
The denizens of [[Abaddon]], daemons want nothing less than the extinction of all life in the multiverse.
[[Demodand]]
Created by the [[Titan|titans]] in mockery of mortals, the demodands do their masters' bidding to tear down the works of the gods.
[[Demon]]
The spawn of the [[Abyss]], demons are born from mortal souls gorged on sin and wish to bring pain and suffering to all mortal life.
[[Devil]]
The devils are the legions of [[Hell]], created by [[Asmodeus]] to bring his vision of ruthless, brutal order to all existence.
[[Div]]
Created from the souls of corrupt [[Genie|genies]], divs exist to bring misery to mortals and despoil all that is beautiful.
[[Velstrac]]
Denizens of the [[Shadow Plane]], velstracs warp flesh and spirit in endless pursuit of perverse "perfection".
[[Oni]]
Spirits of rage and jealousy given physical bodies, oni live only to sate their endless destructive lusts.
[[Qlippoth]]
The primeval denizens of the Abyss, the alien qlippoth seek to destroy the demonic usurpers through the destruction of sin itself—by slaughtering mortals.
[[Rakshasa]]
The rakshasas are "earthbound evils", decadent and debauched souls with the shapes of fiends but bound in mortal bodies.
[[Sahkil]]
Sahkils are former [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]] who rebel against their role as soul shepherds for the [[River of Souls]].
> Other evil outsiders that do not fall into any specific category, such as [[Barghest|barghests]] or [[Dorvae|dorvaes]], may also be considered fiends.
