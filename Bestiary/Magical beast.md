> **Magical beasts** bear much resemblance to normal [[Animal|animals]] but differ from those mundane creatures in at least one of many ways. For instance, magical beasts might have intelligence well beyond that of animals, maybe even beyond that of the average [[Human|human]]. They may be able to speak or, at least, understand [[Languages of Golarion|languages]]. Such creatures may have abilities never experienced in the animal kingdom that are of a supernatural or a [[Magic|magical]] derivation.
