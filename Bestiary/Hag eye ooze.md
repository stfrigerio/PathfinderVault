> [[Hag|Hags]] can perform a [[Ritual|ritual]] to create an [[Ooze|ooze]] that incorporates a *[[Hag eye|hag eye]]*. Known as a **hag eye ooze**, these creatures serve as covert, autonomous surveillers. They are prepared by cooking a putrid mixture of nutrients and reagents for up to two weeks, then adding a *hag eye*, although the period can be shortened considerably by working as a coven.


## Coven ooze


> A **coven ooze** forms when a hag eye ooze combines with multiple *hag eyes*, whether already formed or created by it from the latent [[Magic|magic]] and an eyeball from a dead hag. For instance, coven oozes might form when a hag coven is destroyed while a hag eye ooze remains close by. Coven oozes can also consume hag eye oozes, and consuming new *hag eyes* by any means increases their size to potentially massive proportions.
