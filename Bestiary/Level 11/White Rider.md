> The **White Rider** is one of [[Baba Yaga's Riders|Baba Yagas Riders]], the heralds who proceed the [[Baba Yaga|Witch Queen]] to [[Irrisen]] so they they may judge the inhabitants of that snowy realm. The White Rider performs his duty in the daylight hours of the morning, leaving the afternoon and the night to his companions, the [[Red Rider|Red]] and the [[Black Rider]], respectively. Baba Yaga refers to this rider, mounted on a white destrier, as 'My Bright Morning', while the [[Jadwiga]] call him 'Day'.
