> **Thunderbirds** are enormous [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|avians]] similar to [[Roc|rocs]] that dwell in remote mountains and hills across [[Golarion]]. An adult thunderbird is constantly surrounded by a lightning storm and strong winds, and thunderbirds are venerated as bringers of rain in arid regions but also feared for their destructive potential. When angered, they lay waste to entire villages with hurricanes.
> Thunderbirds lay their eggs near waterfalls and bring their hatchlings to mountain peaks where lightning can strike them. Thunderbirds are capable of seeing through all weather and firing rays of lightning.
