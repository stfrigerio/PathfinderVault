> Dwelling amidst the highest mountains, **cloud giants** make for either serene and gracious neighbours or huge barbaric raiders, depending on their [[Alignment|alignment]].


## History

> Cloud giants were used in [[Thassilon]] as shock troops by their [[Slaver|slavers]], and were found throughout the empire. Their numbers decreased sharply after [[Earthfall]] and the fall of Thassilon; although cloud giant culture recovered after the [[Age of Darkness]], the cloud giant species has never reached the numbers it had before Earthfall. Many cloud giants retreated in isolation to the peaks of the [[Kodar Mountains]] after the fall of Thassilon, although others traveled to more distant ranges such as the [[Mindspin Mountains|Mindspin]] and the [[Menador Mountains]], while others settled ruined Thassilonian outposts and settlements such as [[Xin-Shalast]].
> During the [[Age of Anguish]], the cloud giants began to establish contact with other [[Humanoid|humanoid]] species, which caused their own society to divide into two camps. One camp sought to nurture and guide the development of other societies, both out of a feeling of duty to use what they saw as their inborn gifts to uplift less-advantaged species and a desire to never see the cruelty of Thassilon arise again. The members of the other saw it as their right to rule over other species, and that those who could not defend their property did not deserve to keep it. This disagreement led to a deep rift among the cloud giants, as the divide escalated into bloodshed and the assassination of prominent scholars, and remains unhealed into the present.


## Society

> Cloud giants are divided into two distinct and rival societies. One tradition of cloud giants lives in harmony and peace with nearby humanoid societies, often acting as mentors and guides for other species; these cloud giants tend to prefer inhabiting luxurious and elegant mansions and castles, and are very fond of expensive and expertly [[Spice|spiced]] foods and delicacies. The other believes in the cloud giants' inborn right to take what they wish from other species, living in seclusion in lairs of roughly-hewn rock in the mountains outside of brutal raids on other species' settlements. These latter cloud giants view their kin's preference for luxury and elegance as needless wastes of effort, leading to their preference for rougher, undecorated homes. Regardless of moral alignment, cloud giants are strictly monogamous and tend to enter arranged marriages calculated to join distant communities and mitigate their species' low fertility.
> Cloud giants hold flying creatures in high regard, and keep and train multiple kinds ranging from common [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]] to [[Griffin|griffins]], [[Hippogriff|hippogriffs]], and [[Roc|rocs]] that are sometimes used as enormous flying mounts. Benevolent cloud giants also keep [[Pegasus|pegasi]] and [[Dragon horse|dragon horses]], while their [[Evil|evil]] counterparts are known to ally with [[Harpy|harpies]] and [[Mihstu|mihstus]]. Cloud giant [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] and [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]] who form particular bonds with flying features are known as bird mavens, and hold positions of honor among all cloud giants.
> Many cloud giants worship [[Gozreh|Gozrehs]] male aspect as the [[Deity|god]] of the sky and storms, whom they refer to as Ioz'om the Sky Father and depict as a beautiful, towering cloud giant man. In cloud giant religious belief, Ioz'om brought the first of their kind to [[Golarion]] from the [[Great Beyond]]. Some evil giants worship [[Rovagug]] instead, while [[Magic|magically]] inclined cloud giants are know to worship [[Nethys]].
