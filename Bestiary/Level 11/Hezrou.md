> Prodigiously strong, **hezrous** serve as the brutish muscle for stronger, more cunning [[Demon|demons]], but these reptilian fiends are far from stupid and are considered to be dangerous opponents. They are sometimes known as **toad demons** or **swamp demons**.



## Associated sin

> Poisoning, pollution of the body, pollution of the world.


## Appearance

> The most prominent feature of a hezrou is its build, a veritable bulging wall of muscle that has vastly outgrown its meagre humanoid frame. While its general frame is that of a bipedal [[Humanoid|humanoid]] with two arms and two legs, a hezrou's appearance more resembles a giant, armored toad. Its skin is covered in slimy scales, and its bulging size resembles a giant bullfrog. Its face is its most reptilian feature, looking like a frog's face but with a far larger, more sinister mouth lined with row upon row of sharp teeth. Its body constantly leaks horrid, noxious fluid that severely sickens any who get to close to the monstrous demon.


## Habitat and ecology

> In the [[Abyss]], hezrous inhabit all places where water collects, from swamps and oceans to pockets of the plane filled by the waste of areas of the Abyss more alive than others.  When on the [[Material Plane]], hezrous tend to dwell in swamps, where their mere presence is a blight on the land and causes the plants to become gnarled and sickly while turning the surrounding water thick and brackish. Over time this corruption can even spread to living creatures, the children of nearby, isolated communities becoming deformed and twisted. [[Boggard|Boggards]], being fellow favored children of Gogunta, generally avoid the negative effects of living in close proximity to a hezrou, and the demon hulks are often sent to lead their marshy communities.
> Hezrous do not make the greatest leaders, though, as they are rather unambitious, often wasting their intelligence on base pursuits like torture, destruction, eating, and sleeping. The monstrous and bestial hezrous are formed in the abyss from damned souls of evil mortals who poisoned themselves, their kin, or their surroundings, such as assassins, drug addicts, and careless alchemists who gave no concern for the environmental side-effects of their experiments.


## On Golarion

An armored hezrou.
> Boggards view hezrous as sacred creatures. Boggard conjurers generally lack the power to control such powerful creatures, but are content to simply call them to [[Golarion]] and let them run amok.
> Gogunta also sends hezrous to areas of Golarion populated by boggard tribes, such as the [[Mushfens]] of [[Varisia]], the [[Sodden Lands]], and the [[River Kingdoms]]. A few boggard tribes of the Sodden Lands are ruled by hezrou.


## In the Great Beyond

> Hezrous dwell in the vast swamps, mires and waterways of [[Mephizim]], the realm of their patron [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Gogunta]]. Several hezrous also live in [[Moonbog]], where they compete with [[Jezelda]]'s demonic [[Wolf|wolves]] for control of their territories, and in the oceans and seashores of [[Ishiar]].
