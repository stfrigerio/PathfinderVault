> The **cameroceras** is a giant deep-dwelling nautilus with a long shell.



## Appearance

> The average cameroceras is 25 feet long, the majority of which is its long, hollow shell. Most cameroceras weigh 2,000 pounds. In addition to its grabbing tentacles, a cameroceras has four tentacles that grant it a keen sense of smell. Its shell can tolerate the pressure of up to one mile beneath the surface, though it cannot survive for long at greater depths.


## Ecology

> Cameroceras are ambush predators often found in the mesopelagic zone of the ocean, but occasionally come nearer to the surface to hunt. When a cameroceras catches prey, it can wrap it in its tentacles and pull it into its shell while diving to feed at its leisure.


## In Golarion

> Populations of camerocerases live in the [[Antarkos Ocean]], where they feed on the abundant [[Fish|fish]] and krill found there.
