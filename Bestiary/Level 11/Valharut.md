> **Valharuts** are a specialised type of [[Inevitable|inevitable]] with the purpose of serving as soldiers against [[Chaos|chaos]].


## Appearance

> A valharut resembles a four-armed faceless woman with pale marble flesh and visible blue veins.


## Ecology

> Unlike other inevitables, the valharut is not designed to protect or maintain a specific universal constant or planar [[Law|law]]; instead, they serve as champions of [[Axis]] in its eternal war against the chaos of the [[Maelstrom]]. As such, valharuts are more often seen outside of [[Axis]], fighting [[Protean|proteans]] and other enemies of law under command of [[Axiomite|axiomites]].
