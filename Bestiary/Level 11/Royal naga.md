> **Royal nagas** are colorful, five-headed [[Naga|nagas]] with a stern, commanding air that guard treasures in lost cities.


## Appearance

> Royal nagas are [[Serpent|serpentine]] creatures that can be more than 14 feet long, with lustrous, [[Gemstone|jewel]]-like scales. However, the creatures can assume [[Humanoid|humanoid]] forms to deceive or interrogate intruders.


## Behavior & Ecology

> These creatures are known to be exceptionally long-lived, exceeding 1,400 years of age in some cases. They can naturally cast [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[Spell|spells]], and can blind or mute creatures with their hypnotic gaze.

Although [[Dark naga|dark nagas]] and [[Guardian naga|guardian nagas]] have a deep respect for the them, royal nagas and [[Spirit naga|spirit nagas]] are virulent enemies.
