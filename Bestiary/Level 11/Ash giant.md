> **Ash giants** are [[Giant|giants]] that have been warped by either [[Arcane|arcane]] or extraterrestrial energies and inhabit the most desolate wastelands of the [[Inner Sea region]].



## Appearance

> Ash giants generally have pale skin that is covered in tumours, open sores, and unpleasant-looking scars. They stand a little larger than a typical [[Ogre|ogre]] at around 10 feet tall and normally weigh around 1,200 pounds.


## Habitat & Ecology

> Ash giants are normally found in the most desolate of wastelands, those ravaged by either magical or alien energies that would damage or kill most other inhabitants, yet ash giants thrive in these desolate places. They are a hardy species, completely immune to [[Diseases of Golarion|diseases]] but they still carry and transmit [[Diseases of Golarionash giant leprosy|ash giant leprosy]]. Thanks to their hulking stature, ash giants are able to wield [[Weapon|weapons]] designed for larger giants with relative ease. They also boast a strange empathy with giant [[Vermin|vermin]], using them as guard creatures and sometimes even riding truly enormous examples, such as [[Black scorpion|black scorpions]] and [[Titan centipede|titan centipedes]], into battle.


## Society

> While not truly [[Evil|evil]], ash giant society is harsh and violent. They have a morbid sense of humour, finding pranks that kill or maim their tribe mates just as funny as those that only mildly embarrass them. Due to these dark tendencies, ash giants are often treated with violent hostility by neighbouring tribes and as a result are normally openly hostile to anyone outside their tribe.


## On Golarion

> Ash giants are most commonly found in the [[Mana Wastes]], the most desolate parts of [[Numeria]], and the [[Darklands]]. The Shatter Smile Clan, along with several other nomadic ash giant tribes, dwell in southern [[Qadira]], in a region known as the [[Parchlands]]. The Shatter Smiles are led by the [[Groetus]]-worshipping [[Mother Grim Moon]] and hold the ancient, [[Curses of Golarion|cursed]] city of Neruzavin to be holy ground. In [[Tian Xia]], ash giants can be found in the dangerous areas of [[Shaguang]] nearest to the looming [[Wall of Heaven|Wall of Heaven Mountains]].
