> **Retrievers** are the most famous of the [[Construct|constructs]] fashioned by the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Haagenti]] from [[Abyss|Abyssal]] [[Quintessence|quintessence]].


## Appearance

> A retriever resembles a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spider]] the size of an [[Elephant|elephant]], and its leg-span is nearly 30 feet. It weighs 6,500 pounds. Its eyes shimmer with [[Magic|magical]] energy and are capable of unleashing potent eye beams.


## Ecology

> Retrievers serve to seek out servants who abandon their loyalties or flee from servitude from their demon lord master. Often, a retriever's presence is sufficient to ensure the loyalty of lesser [[Demon|demons]]. Retrievers are just smart enough to excellently track down specific objects and return them to their masters, but not to think of freedom and rebellion. Although a retriever is not an [[Outsider|outsider]], it may nonetheless be [[Magic/Conjuration|conjured]] as if it were one.
