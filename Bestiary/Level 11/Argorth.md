> Argorths are the spawn of the [[Mother of Oblivion|Mothers of Oblivion]], and are among the most fearsome minions of [[Lamashtu]]. They are beasts of raw destructionâ€”walking natural disastersâ€”that follow the quiet whispers of their [[Demon|demon]] goddess. 


## Appearance & Description

> Argorths looks like enormous, unholy worms made of thrashing flesh and gnashing teeth. They lack the segmented appearance of a worm, and are supported by numerous tentacle-like legs. Argorths are nearly thirty feet in length, and don't appear to have any sort of sensory organ. Their faces, if they can be called faces, consist entirely of a gaping chasm-like mouth lined with shark-like teeth the width of their body.
> As a savage creature entirely obsessed with destruction, the argorth does not have a wide array of special powers, and those it does have, all help it in its ruinous quest. It can unleash an unholy, unearthly howl that terrifies any but the most stalwart of souls. Due to its enormous size, it can swallow most creatures whole, or use its tremendous mass to simply crush the life them.


## Habitat & Ecology

> An argorth does not have a set habitat. It wanders the land, carving a trail of destruction wherever it goes. They do not seek the company of other argorths, since their unique method of creation removes the need even to mate. Argorths are not born in any conventional sense of the word. They are created from the severed tentacle of a Mother of Oblivion: their tentacles can become so enraged with blood-thirst that they refuse to stop killing, and attack even when everything left to kill is dead. In this case, the Mother of Oblivion tears off her own tentacle, thus creating a monster known as an argorth.
