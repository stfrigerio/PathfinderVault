> **Wild hunt horses** are [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]]-like [[Fey|fey]] with a grassy mane and tail that serve as the mounts for other members of the [[Wild hunt|wild hunt]]. They stand upon wispy puffs of air, and when not hunting, wild hunt horses enjoy constructing complicated courses through land and air and racing for ever-changing stakes.
