> **Erodaemons** are a race of [[Daemon|daemon]] who seek to break apart the bonds of family, faith, or friendship, whether by death, betrayal, or other loss. Unlike many others of their kind, they prefer achieving this through subtle means that often take quite some time. For instance, an erodaemon can see into a target's mind and identify the target's erotic fantasies; the erodaemon can then polymorph into an incarnation of what the target most desires.
