### Zombie lords

***Main article: [[Zombie lord]]***
> On rare occasions, a zombie will retain intelligence and memories from its former life. Known as **zombie lords**, these creatures do not have their lesser brethrens' sluggish movement, and are generally a much greater threat as well.


### Zyphus zombie

> **Zyphus zombies** are [[Undead|undead]] animated by the necromantic powers of the *[[Zyphus Stone]]*, an ancient [[Azlant|Azlanti]] [[Artifact|artifact]] unearthed in [[4708 AR]] from chambers buried below the [[House of the Immortal Son]] in [[Oppara]], [[Taldor]], and dedicated to [[Zyphus]], the [[Deity|god]] of accidental death. Zyphus zombies carry a [[Disease|disease]] called [[Zyphus rot]] that causes corporeal creatures slain by them to rise as regular zombies within a few minutes. These latter zombies do not carry the disease, and are otherwise like a normal zombie.
