*This article is about the [[Construct|construct]] type. Golems, like [[Robot|robots]] and [[Clockwork|clockworks]], have been generically described as "automatons" but are otherwise dissimilar from the specific [[Automaton|automaton]] construct subtype.*
> A **golem** is a [[Magic|magically]] created [[Construct|construct]] most often animated by infusing a lifeless form with an [[Elemental|elemental]] spirit, generally an [[Earth elemental|earth elemental]]. A golem is mindless and serves at its creator's command; creators of golems are known as **golemwrights**.
