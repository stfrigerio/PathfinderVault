> **Wrath-Blazing Xotani, the Firebleeder**, was a [[Spawn of Rovagug]]. It haunted northeastern [[Garund]] and the portion of [[Nar-Voth]] below. Scholars blame it for the wastes of [[Katapesh]], [[Nex]], and southern [[Osirion]]. It did not cross the [[Inner Sea]] and appears not to have delved into [[Sekamina]].



## Appearance

> Xotani is said to resemble a massive worm with sharp claws and a massive maw. According to some accounts, it has dozens or hundreds of empty eye sockets, though these may simply have been nostrils or open wounds, belching forth wet flame. Churning magma feeds its organs and burns alive those who succeeded in piercing its flesh. Xotani was a land-bound creature, capable of quickly burrowing through even stone.


## Ecology

> Xotani spent most of its time underground, as it was unable to tolerate [[Sun|sunlight]]. Even then, its passage turned crops to ash, huts to tinder, and sand to glass, and in at least one documented case, it destroyed a city high in the [[Brazen Peaks]] at the height of midday, producing plumes of black smoke visible from a hundred miles away.
> Thunder without clouds and electricity crackling from the sands were seen before the arrival of Xotani, and reported across the entirety of Garund as its work.


## Background

> After Xotani emerged from the [[Barrier Wall]] and began to lay waste to Katapesh, its tales spread far and many heroes sought to defeat it, but none were prepared to face a Spawn of Rovagug. Xotani survived numerous attempts to bring it down, including freezing [[Magic|magic]], being dropped from an incredible height, and immersion in the [[Obari Ocean]]. The people of Katapesh fled their cities in fear, becoming nomads that would never dare to settle.
> In around 2100 AR, the Legion of Wandsâ€”comprised of [[Genie binder|genie binders]] from Katapesh, sand mages from Osirion, [[Archmage|archmages]] from Nex, and others from across Garundâ€”formed, and, in [[2104 AR]], the Legion trapped Xotani in the [[Brazen Peaks]] of Katapesh. After a battle lasting "a day and a night", which saw half their ranks burnt away by Xotani, they defeated it. The Firebleeder fell, buried by searing ice and its victims' bones. Xotani's remains lie in the [[Volcanic|volcanic]] caverns beneath [[Pale Mountain]], whose name is said to come from the bones of those who gave their lives to defeat it.


## Legacy

> However, it is impossible to kill a Spawn of Rovagug. A famous legend speaks that Xotani could be brought back to life by a thousand *wishes*, one per wound inflicted by the Legion of Wands, spoken above its corpse.
> In the following centuries, rumour has it that numerous terrible monsters have emerged from Xotani's corpse: clouds of black sand, [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]] [[Zombie|zombies]] with [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spider]] limbs and grey blood, and guttural, unearthly howls.
> In [[4709 AR]], the [[Efreeti|efreeti]] [[Jhavhul]] took over [[Kelmarane]], a village built near Xotani's grave, for his plan to use his own *wishes*, siphoned through others, to absorb and infuse himself with Xotani's essence. His plan was foiled by a band of [[Adventurer|adventurers]], who interrupted Jhavhul's final *wish*, which nonetheless still had enough power to briefly rouse Xotani, resulting in Pale Mountain partially erupting, leaving a massive crater and exposing Xotani's remains. This has given rise to a population of [[Xotanispawn]], [[Beetle|beetles]] corrupted by feeding on the Firebleeder's corpse.
