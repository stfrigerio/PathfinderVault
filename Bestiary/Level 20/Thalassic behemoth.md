> A **thalassic behemoth** is a massive aquatic [[Behemoth|behemoth]] sent by the [[Deity|gods]] to destroy all who live near the coast.


## On Golarion

> The thalassic behemoth Oursmariku appeared near the [[Iblydos|Iblydan archipelago]] at the beginning of the [[Age of Lost Omens]], quickly destroying the navy of the city of [[Liachora]], before turning its wrath on the city itself. The neighboring city of [[Aelyosos]] has escaped this fate only by offering yearly sacrifices of [[Gold|gold]], livestock, incense, and other valuables to the Brobdingnagian creature.
> Another behemoth, named Tankelskel, lives in the heart of the [[Valashmai Sea]]. Nobody knows exactly what purpose has sent the creature to this place or who the target of its wrath will be, but it is certain that, when its attack is eventually unleashed on the coasts of [[Tian Xia]] or [[Sarusan]], the effects will be devastating.
