    desc: "  When a creature is subject to a [[fortune]] effect from a norn and a [[misfortune]] effect from any source other than a norn (or vice versa), the norn's effect automatically counteracts the other effect and then takes place normally, rather than the two effects canceling each other out. If both the [[fortune]] and [[misfortune]] effect are from a norn, then the two cancel each other out as normal. At the GM's discretion, powerful entities related to fate or luck, like Desna, Magdh, or Pharasma, count as a norn for the purpose of this ability."
  - name: "Sever Fate"
    desc: " ([[necromancy]], [[occult]]);  When a norn deals negative damage with a [[Strike]], she regains 10 Hit Points. The target must succeed at a DC 39 Fortitude save or become [[drained|drained 1]] ([[drained|drained 2]] on a critical failure).

If the norn chooses the lower roll, this is a [[misfortune]] effect; if she chooses the higher roll, it's a [[fortune]] effect; if they're the same, she decides which trait to apply."

    desc: "â¬º ([[death]], [[manipulate]], [[necromancy]], [[occult]]); __Frequency__ three times per day  __Effect__  The norn produces a golden thread linked to the fate of a creature within 100 feet of her, then snips it short with her shears. The target takes 100 negative damage (DC 42 basic Fortitude save). If the target is reduced to 0 Hit Points from this damage, the thread is completely severed and the creature dies immediately. A creature slain by Snip Thread can't be restored to life except by miracle, wish, or similarly powerful magic; or by divine intervention. Regardless of the outcome of their saving throw, a creature targeted by Snip Thread then becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours. The norn can't use Snip Thread again for 1d4 (1d4) rounds."

> **Norns** are hooded [[Fey|fey]] women who deliver cryptic prophecies to lost travelers and questing heroes who encounter them along their journeys. These prophecies are often contingent on an inscrutable and subtle test of wisdom and determination imposed by the fey. These tests are mysterious, and those who survive sometimes do not realize that they have been tested.



## Appearance

> A norn resembles an austere woman standing more than 14 feet tall and weighing 800 pounds. Young norns have black hair and eyes; as they age, the former gradually turns blonde and the latter become azure, amber, or violet. Their hair is tied in braids that approach their feet, and they usually wear luxurious, flowing furs.
> On the [[Material Plane]], norns usually travel in groups of three, known as triumvirates. In each triumvirate, there always appear to be one young adult (a Maiden), a middle-aged (Mother) and an old crone (Matriarch), regardless of the norns' actual appearance. A triumvirate appears to act with a singular mind and all three norns speak in perfect unison; the strength of all three seems dependent on the other two. Although a triumvirate is often considered to be a single [[Soul|soul]] split into three bodies, this is incorrect: each member is an individual person.


## Ecology

> In a time beyond history, all norns were born in threes, in a process that no longer happens anymore. Norns in a single triumvirate are bound across all their lives. If a norn dies on the Material Plane, she is reborn on the [[First World]] and seeks out her companions after growing. Reborn norns can recognise their companions and keep some memories but often forget the circumstances of their death or the details of old missions.
> On the Material Plane, norns grow confused and weak. Their ability to interpret fate becomes warped, and they stop serving fate, instead pursuing their own goals, in the process turning either [[Lawful good|good]] or [[Lawful evil|evil]]. For some reason, travelling in triumvirates prevents this from happening and allows norns to keep their powers.
> Due to their size, norns are voracious, prefer raw meat, and always strike their quarry at the right place and time when hunting with their shears. Norns are ageless on their native First World but slowly age on the Material Plane; scholars agree that norns who spend more than 300 years on the Material begin to grow weak and confused, and believe that they can die of old age, but no one knows their exact lifespan.


## Habitat

> Norns usually do not bother to adorn their lairs on the Material Plane, since they are only there when waiting for companions or working long-term plans. Being private creatures, they usually hide their abodes with powerful [[Magic|magic]] or put them in places conventionally inaccessible, and keep them safe with [[Trap|traps]].
> Norns care little about material wealth, but understand economics and keep [[Coins|coins]] and [[Gemstone|jewels]] as incentives or payment for other creatures. Their most famous treasures are [[Gold|gold]] bars and intricate [[Magic item|magical devices]] that they use to produce the golden thread to cut fates short. Gears that are removed from such devices impart a curious effect. Norns are quick to unleash their wrath on would-be thieves in their lairs.


## History

> From myths about norns, historians have extracted some common points that can be accepted as fact. It is agreed that they originated before the [[Deity|gods]] abandoned the First World, considered themselves caretakers of all [[Great Beyond|creation]], and believed that they had failed their mission when the First World was abandoned. Since then, norns have sought to atone for this failure.
> Perhaps due to norns' connections to the [[First World]], the predictions of these hooded figures are strangely accurate even when most prophecies fail in the [[Age of Lost Omens]].


## Society

> Most norns work to maintain the gears of fate, except for a few who serve the [[Eldest]], most often [[Magdh]], who is sometimes believed to be the first norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, and expects her norn servants to follow cryptic commands to help prevent some future cataclysm. These norns often clash with their kin who balk at serving the Eldest and believe that even such powerful beings should not be allowed to meddle with fate.
> While even a weak Eldest could easily destroy an unaffiliated norn, they tend to follow judgements issued by norns. The norns judiciously use their perceived neutrality, knowing that the Eldest could easily grow frustrated if given too many demands, resulting in a tenuous balance of power.
> Norns rarely interact with other fey outside of their triumvirates, instead viewing all creatures as equally key to fate's designs, with the exception of [[Human|humans]]. Norns believe that humans are capable of great deeds, and pay close attention to them (especially [[Adventurer|adventurers]]), interfering when necessary. Norn triumvirates prefer to work by themselves but are willing to ally with powerful creatures if needed.


## Norns as deities

> Each norn is a [[Deity|divine being]] in her own right, and those who worship norns are known as **Followers of Fate**. Norns do little to encourage or discourage their own worship. Regardless of the individual norn(s) they worship, all [[Cleric|clerics]] of the Followers of Fate receive the same power.


## On Golarion

> On [[Golarion]], norns are most often sighted in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], and sometimes in neighboring realms. The reason is speculated to be because they foresee a cataclysm that will take place there, or because the veil between the Material Plane and First World is thin in the wilds of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, particularly the [[Grungir Forest]]. They often shepherd groups of [[Animal|animals]] from the First World to serve as livestock, leading to sightings of impossible creatures in the Grungir Forest. Many make their homes within [[Forestheart]] or near [[Moonwing's Bough|Moonwings Bough]], and are usually mobile, moving when necessary. Norns that are secretive or protective of their treasure usually live in [[Nithveil]].
> Norns' missions often lead them to [[Hagreach]], where they provoke adventurers into harassing the [[Winter witch|winter witches]]; [[Icemark]], where they aid heroes regardless of how they are received; and to the [[Ironbound Island]], whose ruler [[White Estrid]] has working relationships with some triumvirates. They have also been seen in [[Irrisen]], fighting against [[Baba Yaga]].
> Norn worship is most prominent among the [[Varki]] who live in [[Icemark]], where the Followers of Fate are considered a fringe religion by the majority who worship any combination of [[Erastil]], [[Green Faith|nature]], or their ancestors.
> The [[Ulfen]] king [[Ingimundr the Unruly]] of [[Bildt]] has advocated taking up the mantle of his forefathers, and resumed raids against the lands to the south and east. The norns have repeatedly cautioned against this.


## In the Great Beyond

> [[Erecura]], Queen of [[Dis]], has three norns serving her as handmaidens: Felixia, Rowane, and Selieste.


> [[Paizo Inc]] published a major chapter about norns in *[[Fey Revisited]]*.
