> Aside from the [[Demon lord|demon lords]], the dreaded **balors** are the most powerful of the [[Demon|demons]] of the [[Abyss]]. They are sometimes known as **fire demons**.



## Associated sin

![[Balor_fight.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A balor striking down its [[Mortal|mortal]] opponent.
> All sins, taken to an ultimate degree of excess.


## Appearance

> The epitome of demonkind, a balor demon appears as a tall, horned pillar of flesh and fire. A typical specimen is 14 feet in height and weighs 4,500 pounds.


## Habitat and society

> As with most demons, balors are created from [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Soul|souls]]. However, while one [[Evil|evil]] soul can create several lesser demons, it usually takes the souls of several powerful villains to generate a single balor.
> Most balors act as the main generals of the various demon lords, leading vast armies of demons into battle on behalf of their masters. They are content to let their minions fight on their behalf, but relish the prospect of personal combat when challenged directly. They are generally only found singly or in the company of other demons.


## Abilities

> A balors usually fights with a flaming [[Whip|whip]] in one hand and a [[Longsword|longsword]] in the other. It is somehow able to imbue both these weapons with the fearsome quality of a [[Vorpal weapon|vorpal weapon]], enhancing its already formidable melee prowess. The balor can also use its whip to entangle a foe and draw it within the reach of its deadly sword. They can also call upon a powerful suite of [[Spell|spell-like]] abilities that enable them to [[Magic/Conjuration|summon]] demonic allies, rain fiery death down upon their foes, or control others' minds. So great is the infernal heat of the balor that any who come close enough to strike the demon with their bare hands are badly burned.
> If a balor is killed, it poses one last danger: its body explodes into an inferno of fire and unholy energy that engulfs everything within 100 feet.


## Balor Lords 

> Some unusually powerful balors do not have a demon lord for a master. Instead these so-called **Balor Lords** rule in their own right. Only a true demon lord can command an entire [[Abyssal realm]], but the greatest of the Balor Lords rule up to half of a realm.
> Balor Lords are equivalent in might to the [[Demon lordnascent demon lord|nascent demon lords]] and have abilities above and beyond those of ordinary balors. Some can heal themselves by slaying living creatures, others have additional spell-like abilities, and perhaps the most feared of all can inhale the souls of nearby living creatures, killing the victim and transforming its corpse into a [[Babau|babau]], [[Succubus|succubus]], or [[Shadow demon|shadow demon]].


## On Golarion

![[Khorramzadeh.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Khorramzadeh]], the Storm King of [[Iz]].
> Like most demons, balors usually live in the [[Abyss]]. It takes powerful [[Magic|magic]] to summon a balor to the [[Material Plane]], and it is not to be done lightly. A balor views any period of enforced servitude, however short or stress-free, to be a personal affront and goes to any length to avenge itself.
> Balors rule many of the various petty fiefdoms that make up the [[Worldwound]] in northern [[Avistan]]. Arguably the most powerful of these is the balor [[Korramzadeh]], also known as the Storm King, who rules the city of [[Iz]]. Unusually for a balor, his form appears to be bathed in lightning rather than fire. The Storm King seems to be gathering a growing force of demons to his banner, and the forces of [[Mendev]] have launched the [[Fourth Mendevian Crusade]] to check his growing power.



> [[Paizo]] published a sourcebook about demons called *[[Demons Revisited]]*, which includes a chapter about balor demons.
