> **Izfiitars** are the highest caste of [[Protean|proteans]].



## Appearance

> The izfiitar is a six-armed [[Serpent|serpentine]] monster crowned by a halo of ever-changing symbols. Izfiitars are smaller in size than the next-highest protean caste, [[Keketar|keketars]].


## Abilities

> Izfiitars have monstrous physical attacks and stupendous [[Magic|magical]] powers. They wield a more powerful version of lesser proteans' warpwave, as well as abilities that bend reality and alter probability.


## Ecology

> Izfiitars loom above keketars who pay them obeisance, cardinals among the clergy. Aloof and distant even by keketar standards, izfiitars rarely leave the deepest [[Maelstrom]], content to divine the will of the [[Speakers of the Depths]].
> It is speculated that izfiitars are essentially keketars chosen for reasons unknown and elevated either by the Maelstrom itself or by a [[Protean lord|protean lord]]. Like keketars, izfiitars are bound to choruses; not every chorus contains an izfiitar, and the size and influence of any given chorus is entirely independent of the number of izfiitars present.


## Heralds of the Speakers

> **Heralds of the Speakers** are izfiitars that wield greater power and authority than their kin and take a more direct hand in guiding the choruses than the distant protean lords.
