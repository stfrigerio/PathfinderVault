> **Star-spawn of Cthulhu** is the name given by scholars to a race of titanic malevolent alien [[Sorted Traits/creature/aberration|aberrations]] that bear a resemblance to and serve the [[Great Old One]] [[Cthulhu]].



## Appearance

> A star-spawn is [[Humanoid|humanoid]]-shaped, with seething rubbery flesh, [[Dragon|draconic]] wings, taloned hands and a tentacled face. Their form is not fixed, and they can retract or enlarge parts of their body at will, but they rarely deviate far from their general form. The smallest star-spawn stands nearly 30 feet in height.


## Ecology

> Star-spawn do not need food or air and are at home in every environment, but are more often associated with oceans than land, since oceans tend to cover a greater part of a [[Planet|planets]] surface. Their mind is alien, overwhelmingly powerful, and linked to that of dead Cthulhu sleeping and dreaming in his house of [[R'lyeh|Rlyeh]]. Star-spawn can [[Immortal|live forever]] if not killed.


## Society

> Star-spawn hail from a distant [[Star|star]] in the [[Dark Tapestry]], whose light is invisible to conventional telescopes. They seek to expand the Dark Tapestry by invading planets and exterminating their indigenous life, which they view in the same way that [[Human|humans]] view [[Vermin|vermin]]. They do this by sending nightmares to susceptible individuals to seed the growth of apocalypse cults. When the world becomes unstable enough, the star-spawn mobilises the cults, whose 'reward' involves being the last to be eradicated by the star-spawn.
> Star-spawn are patient enough to wait for centuries or millennia for their plans to come to fruition, since all things can only end when the stars are right. Some worlds have thus had enough time to foil the star-spawn's influence or even destroy them, but this is very rare.
