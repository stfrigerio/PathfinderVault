> **Whisperers** are alien [[Evil|evil]] [[Fey|fey]] that lay claim to wilderness areas as their primeval landscapes. In these areas, especially near the whisperer itself, eerie, inexplicable, hazardous events are common; [[Plant|plants]] and [[Animal|animals]] are unusually hostile, as are previous trespassers who were turned into [[Haunt|haunts]]. The only creatures that whisperers allow in their domain are evil fey and the victims of the whisperer turned into [[Undead|undead]] creatures or haunts.



## Appearance

> A whisperer resembles a fifteen-foot-tall, faceless, incorporeal [[Humanoid|humanoid]].


## Abilities

> Wounds caused by a whisperer's mist tendrils resist [[Healing|healing]]. They can [[Curse|curse]] foes to become so obsessed with their primeval landscapes, they refuse to leave. If killed, a whisperer can resurrect itself at the next new [[Moon|moon]], unless its primeval landscape is dispelled or removed.


## On Golarion

> A whisperer haunts the [[Shy Hills]] to the east of the [[Sandpoint Hinterlands]]. The headwaters of the [[Turandarok River]] lie somewhere within the whisperer's hunting domain and the [[Varisian|Varisians]] of the region have long-held legends about this powerful entity.
