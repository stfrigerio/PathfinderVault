> The **iathavos** is the most powerful breed of [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] outside of the [[Qlippoth lord|qlippoth lords]] themselves. Personifying the [[Chaos|chaos]] and [[Evil|evil]] of the [[Abyss]] itself, the breed is so singular and abhorrent that the Abyss only allows one to exist at a time.



## Appearance

> The iathavos is a colossal, spherical creature with four [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bat-like]] wings. Red eyes peer from all sides, and two huge claws dangle below. It is often attended by [[Nyogoth|nyogoth]] qlippoth that squirm over its body or under its bulk, feeding upon the wastes and fragments left behind by the iathavos.


## Abilities

> The iathavos can absorb and remake other creatures into [[Nyogoth|nyogoths]]â€”one of the worst fates that could befall explorers of the deep Abyss; or fire beams of entropic energy that cause its victims to burst into energy, flesh, shadow and smoke. It also possesses a supernaturally disgusting stench and a bewildering array of [[Magic|magical]] powers, including the ability to shift among the various planes of the [[Great Beyond]], as well as immunity to mind-affecting effects. Creatures that succumb to the iathavos' horrific appearance are feebleminded and permanently blinded. Each new incarnation of the iathavos might have slightly different abilities from the previous one.


## Ecology

> The iathavos wages an eternal crusade against the [[Demon|demons]] and mortal sin. It does not limit its attention to demons in the Abyss, and often travels to the [[Material Plane]] to clear worlds of [[Mortal|mortals]], preventing these worlds from supplying the Abyss with sinful souls to create demons. Worlds that fall victim to the iathavos are thoroughly ruined and inhabited by an unusually large population of nyogoths that remain behind to consume every last speck of decay.
> It is possible to call the iathavos to a world with the most powerful [[Spell|spells]], which will draw its attention to that world. Even if banished or forced to flee by the world's defenders, the iathavos remembers its visit and will often wait for centuries or millennia before coming back to pursue its goals on the world.
> When the iathavos is slain, there's a short interval before the Abyss gives birth to a new one to replace it. The newborn iathavos is fully grown, does not undergo a 'childhood', and does not retain the memories or advancements of the previous iathavos, except for its eternal appetite and hatred for demons and mortal sin. As an iathavos continues to hunt and destroy, it grows more powerful. It rarely takes [[Class|class]] levelsâ€”most that do usually become [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]].


## Realm

> [[Akigyiat]], one of the deepest Abyssal realms, is suspected to be the den of the iathavos. It is claimed by no [[Demon lord|demon lord]], who consider contesting the iathavos over the barren realm's little resources not worth the effort.
