*For another meaning of "Oblivion", please see oblivion (drug).*
> **Oblivions** are a race of colossal, intelligent, omnicidal [[Ooze|oozes]] native from the [[Negative Energy Plane]].



## Appearance

> Oblivions typically measure several dozen feet across, but are covered in a cloud of roiling darkness that seem much larger. Tentacles of smoke coil and writhe beneath them. Oblivions are massless and collapse into nothing when destroyed.


## Ecology

> Oblivions form spontaneously among the accumulated entropy in the darkest parts of the Negative Energy Plane, preferentially near [[Sceaduinar|sceaduinars]] crystalline constructs. They hunger to unmake the entire cosmos and themselves. Scholars debate whether oblivions are intrinsic to the Negative Energy Plane or the result of sceaduinar manipulation of the [[Plane|plane]].
> Oblivions unleashed upon [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Planet|worlds]] will lay waste to them until destroyed. They often need decades or centuries to end a single world, and are very thorough in their job: their victims are quickly forgotten by others. Some [[Deity|gods]] claim that oblivions are intended to be released upon the [[Multiverse|multiverse]] to cleanse creation and begin a new cycle of life, while others insist their work is nearly complete, leaving only isolated specks of life in the [[Void|void]].
> Oblivions can recreate victims from their dark substance as puppets. They themselves cannot traverse the planes and depend on servants capable of opening [[Portal|portals]] for them. These puppets know little of their masters' will beyond sharing comfort in the coming apocalypse, and most desperately fill in the gaps with [[Philosophies|philosophies]]. Some of the most powerful servants form doomsday cults to prepare for an oblivion's arrival.
> Oblivions are unaffected by *spheres of annihilation* and can move them easily. It is speculated that these *spheres* are unborn oblivions, as rare survivors recount tales of *spheres* spontaneously birthing them.
> An oblivion is a manifestation of disbelief and decay: any spaces it moves through are left fallow and lifeless, and the forces of compassion and creativity are anathema to it.


## Society

> Oblivions serve no masters or agendas. They believe themselves to be the way all things must end, exhibit neither allegiance nor antipathy toward sceaduinars and rarely communicate with others, making their motives a mystery.
