> This article might have further canon details available on **[[httpsstarfinderwikicomLashunta|StarfinderWiki]]**.


> **Lashuntas** are a species of [[Humanoid|humanoids]] native to the continent of Asana. They are the most influential species on the [[Planet|planet]] [[Castrovel]], and live in an educated, civilized society.



## Culture

*See also: Lashunta city-statesÂ and [[Qabarat]]*
> Lashuntas constantly plot and maneuver for political positions within their scattered city-states, each of which is ruled by an elected or hereditary ruler. These connections are strengthened through trade alliances, interbreeding, and defense pacts, with conflict typically limited to feuds over honor and ceremonial combat. While they occasionally engage in ritual combat or raid each other, lashuntas always band together against external threats.
> Lashuntas have their own language, also called [[Lashunta language|Lashunta]], and rely on [[Telepathic|telepathic]] and [[Magic|magical]] communication between their city-states. They discovered and understood the interplanetary [[Portal|portals]] that link their [[Planet|planet]] to others long ago, and formed a particularly close bond to the inhabitants of [[Akiton]].


### Damaya and korasha lashunta

> The lashuntas are divided into two castes known as *damaya* and *korasha*. Membership is not hereditary, as lashuntas decide at puberty which they develop into. Damaya are taller than korasha and tend towards roles that require strong leadership and communication skills, while korasha are stout and tend towards physically demanding jobs. Both castes share a strong appetite for intellectual matters.


### Fashion

> Due to Castrovel's warmth and humidity, few lashunta wear any more clothing than is necessary to complete a task.


### Connections with shotalashu

***Main article: [[Shotalashu]]***
> Lashunta warriors form close telepathic bonds with their shotalashu mounts, making them incredibly effective mounted combatants. When a bonded shotalashu or rider dies, the surviving party suffers lasting emotional trauma.


## Psychic ability

> All lashuntas see the pursuit of mental perfection as an admirable goal which has, over the generations, developed into keen [[Psychic magic|psionic]] powers in many members of this austere race.
> Such lashuntas have natural [[Telekinetic|telekinetic]] and [[Telepathic|telepathic]] abilities, which are especially prevalent among lashunta warriors who telepathically bond with their telepathically sensitive [[Shotalashu|shotalashu]] mounts. These innate capabilities help make Castrovel the solar system's dominant home of [[Psychic|psychics]].


## On Golarion

> A lashunta tribe known as the Lotus-Eaters was collected by the crew of the strike [[Starship|starship]] *[[Divinity]]* after it entered Golarion's solar system and stopped by Castrovel to collect rainforest-dwelling life to resupply one of its habitat pods. The lashuntas were then placed in stasis, and remained there when the starship crashed into modern [[Numeria]]. Millennia later, a [[Technic League]] captainâ€”a [[Half-elf|half-elf]] named Prosserâ€”discovered and revived them during an expedition into the [[Silver Mount]], establishing a village within the isolated habitat dome with himself as its chieftain.
> [[Altouna|Lady Altouna]], the ruler of the Numerian city of [[Hajoth Hakados]], is a lashunta who arrived in the city while fleeing from the Technic League. However, most of the city's residents believe her to be a half-elf, a cover that she maintains to avoid drawing unwanted attention to herself.
