> **Skvaders** are creatures resembling [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Level 1/Rabbit|rabbits]] with the wings and tails of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|grouse]].



## Ecology

> Skvaders prefer to live in areas where vegetation is abundant. They are found primarily in temperate forests and wooded hills, but are also drawn to tall-grass prairies and to cultivated fields. Skvaders have high metabolisms, and consequently consume large quantities of [[Plant|plant]] matter. This poses a significant threat to farmers, as a group of skvaders can quickly consume their livelihood. If skvaders strip an area of food, they will simply move elsewhere and continue feeding.
> Skvaders live in communal burrows hosting one or more family groups, which they either dig themselves or take over from other [[Animal|animals]]. Distinct families will coexist with one another until one grows too large, at which point the others will simply move out and seek new territory. Skvaders mate for life; if one partner dies, the other will mourn for a period and then seek out a new mate. Females nurse the young, while males dig burrows, patrol the colony's territory, and protect the females while they give birth. [[Wolpertinger|Wolpertingers]] are sometimes found as part of skvader colonies.
> When attacked, skvaders emit a screech that can be heard from a mile away. Other skvaders that hear it will immediately come to the attacked individual's aid, potentially overwhelming its attacker.


## History

> There are a number of theories concerning the origins of skvaders. Some scholars believe them to be a weaker relative of the wolpertinger that never developed the other creature's relatively greater strength. Others hold skvaders to be predecessors to the [[Owlbear|owlbear]], citing their chimeric mix of avian and mammalian traits, and to have been created as an experiment in combining multiple creatures into one.
