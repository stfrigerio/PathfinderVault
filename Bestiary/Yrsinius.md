---Yrsinius
> This ancient knight had the body of a humanoid insect with a multitude of hydra heads and three mouse tails. Yrsinius reigned for several aeons before suddenly disappearing. Some believe he was wandering into the chaotic depths of the [[Maelstrom]] when he fell victim to an ambush and was destroyed by a group of [[Protean|Proteans]] called the [[Chorus of Malignant Symmetry]]. If it still exists, however, the mighty Yrsinius could still return and claim his throne from [[Apollyon]] (a fact on which the current Pestilence knight often mulls over, since his kinship among the Four would be sidelined). From time to time, rumors emerge within [[Abaddon]] which speak of planar explorers who discover entire cities decimated by the plague in the depths of the [[Abyss]], as well as stories of plagues that devour not only the flesh but also the soul, thus suggesting that Yrsinius may still be alive. Some have come up with a horrible concept that Yrsinius may have survived in some twisted, or chimeric, form rebuilt by the corrupt [[Protean|Proteans]] although they are responsible for his fall.
