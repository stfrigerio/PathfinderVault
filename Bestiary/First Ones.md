>  The mysterious entities known as the **First Ones** arrived on the [[Planet]] of [[Aballon]] thousands of years ago, attracted by the planet's rich reserves of metal. They landed their immense [[spaceships]] and built nine cities on Aballon that still stand today, now referred to as the [[Cities of the First Ones]]. The First Ones abandoned the planet ages ago and have never returned.


## History

>  During their time mining Aballon's resources, they created a race of mechanical servants known as the [[Aballonians]]. When the First Ones eventually departed, the Aballonians were left behind. Some Aballonians, known as [[Those Who Wait]], continue with their ancient tasks in the expectation that the First Ones will one day return. The other Aballonian faction, [[Those Who Become]], believe the First Ones will never return, but that they will one day effectively become First Ones themselves.


## Language

>  The First Ones spoke in an information-rich machine language used in certain [[spells]] used on [[constructs]].
