> **Elephants** are large, quadrupedal herbivorous [[Animal|animals]] with thick skin and two tusks flanking a long, dexterous snout called a trunk.



## Ecology and habitat

> Elephants wander the plains of [[Golarion|Golarions]] warmer climates in large herds of close-knit families. All species of elephant are highly social, and herd members form close social bonds with one another. Occasionally, elephants are separated from their herds by accidents or are cast out. These specimens, termed rogue elephants, often become highly aggressive and dangerous creatures.


## Variants


### Anancuses

> **Anancuses** are primordial relatives of elephants. They are distinguished from their modern cousins by their shorter trunks and much longer tusks.


### Deinotheriums

> **[[Deinotherium|Deinotheriums]]** are large, primeval herbivores related to true elephants. Unlike their relatives, however, they have short trunks and downward-curving tusks.


### Mastodons

> The **mastodon** is an ancient form of elephant that can still be occasionally encountered on Golarion. They have truly massive tusks that curve up towards one another, much larger than those of the elephant. They are distinguished from mammoths by their smaller size. They chiefly inhabit temperate forests, where they live in closely knit groups.


### Mammoths

> **Mammoths** are a type of elephant that have long hair and larger tusks, and live in cold environments. They are more aggressive than common elephants due to living alongside more dangerous predators.


### Teraphants

> **[[Teraphant|Teraphants]]** are elephant-like animals native to [[Vudra]]. They lack tusks, instead possessing three tusk-like horns, and can sense the emotions of living creatures.


## In society

> Elephants are domesticated and used as beasts of burden by many cultures. However, their high intelligence means that they must be handled with great care. Elephants are also valued as impressive mounts by [[Orc|orcs]] across Golarion.
> Elephants are also hunted for the ivory of their tusks, which can sell for very high prices. Certain groups perceive elephants as majestic creatures and seek to protect them, creating danger for elephant hunters.
