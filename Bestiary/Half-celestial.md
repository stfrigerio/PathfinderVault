> A **half-celestial** is the direct offspring of a [[Good|good]] [[Outsider|outsider]] and a [[Mortal|mortal]], although they can also be created by powerful [[Holy|holy]] [[Magic|magic]]. The children of a half-celestial might be [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aasimar|aasimars]] or seemingly normal mortals.
> Half-celestials should not be confused with [[Celestial|celestial creatures]], which are outsiders native to the [[Upper plane|upper planes]] but otherwise similar to their mortal counterparts.

## Ecology

> A half-celestial can be born among any type of mortal creatures; half-celestial [[Dragon|dragons]], [[Griffon|griffons]], and [[Unicorn|unicorns]] are all known to occur. However, only [[Humanoid|humanoid]] half-celestials can give birth to aasimar children or have aasimar descendants. Non-humanoid half-celestials are often sterile; those that are not typically give birth to either half-celestial children or normal members of their mortal species.
