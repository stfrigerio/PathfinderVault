> **Apkallus** are a dedicated race of guardians and caretakers of the laws of [[Axis]]. They stand below only the [[Axiomite hierarch|axiomite hierarchs]] and [[Primordial inevitable|primordial inevitables]] as the most powerful residents of Axis. They were initially created by the [[Godmind of Axis]] to be ambassadors for [[Law|law]] and for Axis on the [[Material Plane]].



## Appearance

> Apkallus appear as large, muscular [[Humanoid|humanoids]] with the heads of raptors and powerful [[Hawk|hawk]]-like wings. Their surplices of [[Fish|fish]] scales glitter with a milky iridescence that casts shimmering rainbows across their forms, and they typically carry [[Magic|magical]] bronze [[Spear|spears]]. They can also adopt a [[Human|human]] and [[Merfolk|merfolk]] form in terrestrial and aquatic settlements.


## Ecology

> Apkallus oppose [[Chaos|chaos]] and protect just rulership and the development of culture, laws, lore, or [[Technology|technology]] from those who seek to tear down progress. To this end, apkallus often travel to numerous worlds, spreading [[Law|lawful]] religions, promoting crafts and the [[Art|arts]], and aiding in the development of fundamental discoveries.
> Apkallus prefer to advise [[Mortal|mortals]] over teaching them directly, nudging inventors toward important discoveries, ensuring that their charges do not become dependent on them. Apkallus are particularly fond of creating shared [[Mindscape|mindscapes]] with [[Telepathy|telepathy]] to show visions of possible futures and developments to their charges in an immersive medium.
> Apkallus carefully record the progress of mortal societies so that knowledge and progress can be restored following a societal collapse, and ensure that their [[Extradimensional|extradimensional]] archives remain well-protected, understanding that certain information can undermine progress and self-reliance. Whenever possible, apkallus ensure that their personal archives can be copied to the library vaults within Axis, where they can be analysed to aid the apkallus and allies in advancing the cause of law throughout the Material Plane. While they remain rare sights in the city, their influence is felt every day when lore about Axis is researched or recorded.
> In times of great need, apkallus rise up to defend Axis or mortal cities under their protection.
