> **Tychilarius**, which translates to **They Drown the Gods in Oblivion** (and is commonly mistranslated as **The Drowned God**), is a resident of the [[Dark Tapestry]]. While considered by some to be a [[Deity|deity]], probably of the level of a [[Great Old One]], Tychilarius cannot grant [[Spell|spells]] to cultists; it is instead a tremendous [[Sorted Traits/creature/aberration|aberration]] made of thousands of creatures supposedly fused in the heart of a [[Black hole|black hole]].



## Appearance

> Tychilarius is a massive tooth-ringed maw surrounded by tentacles.


## Abilities

> Tychilarius is capable of [[Space travel|traveling outer space]] at incredible speeds, firing blasts of plasma from its tentacles, and performing any number of mind-warping horrors. It can overstimulate creatures with incredible sensations, fracture their sanity with [[Psychic magic|psychic energy]], consume them in its maw, and absorb their forms to produce aberrations from their matter and energy.


## History

> On [[Golarion]], Tychilarius's influence stretches back to [[Osirion|pre-Osirian]] tribes of ancient [[Garundi (human ethnicity)|Garundi]]. The little information that remains places it among the leadership of the [[Dominion of the Black]], with an origin of anywhere between [[Aucturn]] and an unknown distant [[Galaxy|galaxy]].


### Imprisonment

> Tychilarius is imprisoned, though the nature of its imprisonment is unknown. Numerous cults, including the [[Night Heralds]], have attempted [[Ritual|rituals]] to summon itâ€”all failures.
