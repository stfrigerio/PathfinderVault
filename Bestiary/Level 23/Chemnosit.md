> **Chemnosit**, also called **Great Doom Chemnosit** or the **Monarch Worm**, is one of the [[Spawn of Rovagug]], and is among the four spawn best known on the continent of [[Avistan]]. When it arrived is unknown, except that it escaped the [[Pit of Gormuz]] after the great [[Beetle|beetle]] [[Ulunat]]. After breaking free from its prison, Chemnosit burrowed into the [[Darklands]], where the [[Urdefhan|urdefhan]] in [[Orv]] and certain of the more debased [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Humanoid|humanoids]] there worship it. On occasion the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Drow|drow]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Duergar|duergar]] of [[Sekamina]] have called it up, usually to the ruin of their settlements. [[Svirfneblin]] have also witnessed it, but perhaps not (yet) in their own domiciles. The book *Way of the End-Name* includes a description of the beast, stating that "it rears up like a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake]] about to strike".
> Chemnosit is not known to be deceased.
