> The mighty **Jabberwocks** are part of the group of legendary [[First World]] creatures known as the [[Tane]]. Some consider them to be the most powerful of the Tane. On their rare visits to the [[Material Plane]] they seem to care only for destruction.
> Jabberwocks are typically 35 feet in height, and weigh 8,000 pounds. They pose the same physical threat as would a [[Dragon|dragon]] of the same huge size, but can also project beams of fire from their eyes, and their violent motions naturally create strong winds which hinder their foes. Perhaps their strangest attack is their "burbling" – at irregular intervals a jabberwock will let loose a blast of nonsense sounds which can temporarily addle the minds of those in the vicinity, or even cause physical damage. 
> Fortunately, jabberwocks do not reproduce naturally. They are created as fully grown adults by a secret process known only to the lords of the [[Fey|fey]] known as the [[Eldest]].
> It is said that [[Vorpal weapon|vorpal weapons]] were originally created as a means of killing Jabberwocks; in any event the beasts have a healthy fear of such weapons.


## Lesser Jabberwock


> Lesser versions of the Jabberwock have been encountered, although even a lesser version of this monster is a formidable opponent. The process of their creation, whilst a closely guarded secret, is not limited to the [[Eldest]]. The [[Bestiary/Nymph|nymph]] queen [[Nyrissa]], one of the few beings known to have survived an attack by a Jabberwock, was able to use blood from her attacker to create a lesser jabberwock.
