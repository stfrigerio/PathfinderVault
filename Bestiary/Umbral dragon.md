> Torn between the [[Material Plane]] and the [[Shadow Plane|Plane of Shadows]], **umbral dragons** do not truly belong to either. As fearsome as any [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/dragon|dragon]], they posses a breath that scours the very life force of their opponents, and can also devour [[Incorporeal undead|incorporeal undead]] by tearing at the essence of their [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/undead|undead]] [[Soul|souls]]. They are one example of the [[Extraplanar|extraplanar]] [[True dragon|true dragons]] known as [[Primal dragon|primal dragons]].



## Appearance

> An umbral dragon resembles a lean, feral [[Black dragon|black dragon]]. Its body is a deep black, like the darkest of shadows, and sleek and serpentine in shape without the many fins that a black dragon uses for swimming. Its tail tapers to a point in a far more snake-like manner than the muscular, lizard-like tail of a black dragon. Their faces are smooth and lack the horny nodules that many black dragons gain later in life. An umbral dragon's horns sweep back behind its head, unlike the black dragon's, whose horns sweep forward. The umbral dragon's eyes are distinct pits of deep crimson.


## Habitat and ecology

> Umbral dragons reside on the Plane of Shadows that spawned them. When not on their native [[Plane|plane]], umbral dragons tend to seek areas that mimic its darkened depths. These lairs include dark and overgrown forests, gloomy swamps, storm-shrouded mountaintops, and lightless underground depths.
> Like most dragons, umbral dragons are solitary predators. But unlike most dragons, they have access to a unique prey: incorporeal undead. How much nutrition they actually draw from their ghostly prey is unknown, but they actively seek out haunted ruins to devour undead, which adds to their fearsome reputation. Likewise, their ability to devour ethereal undead and their [[Negative energy|negative energy]] breath makes umbral dragons popular mounts for powerful undead. Despite the risks, powerful [[Vampire|vampires]], liches, and [[Necromancer|necromancers]] have ridden umbral dragons. Still, they are fickle creaturesÂ who have dropped more than one such rider from the sky or torn them apart.


## Abilities

> Umbral dragons can breathe devastating cones of negative energy that strips the life from living creatures and heals those whose unlife is fueled by it. Unlike most creatures, their material bodies can harm incorporeal creatures, and older, more powerful umbral dragons can command undead creatures.
> As long as they are near some source of shadow, umbral dragons can hide within them.


## On Golarion

*See also: [[CategoryUmbral dragonInhabitants]]*
> On [[Golarion]], their favorite places to live include the shadowed lands of [[Nidal]], the [[Midnight Mountains]], and the vaults of [[Orv]].

> - The shadowy trails of the Mendor Mountains between [[Molthune]] and [[Cheliax]] are the lair of the old umbral dragon [[Gandrohal]]. He feeds on the incorporeal undead that haunt this twilight world, and the occasional living creature that loses its way.
> - In their ongoing battle against the undead, [[Nex|Nexian]] [[Cleric|clerics]] of [[Pharasma]] coaxed the young adult umbral dragon [[Ghostmaw]] to leave his home in the [[Shattered Range]] of southern [[Garund]]. After paying him ever-escalating fees, they send him into the [[Mana Wastes]] to hunt their many foes there.
> - In the [[Vale of Shadows]], the umbral dragon [[Kedretitas]] guards a [[Star Tower]].
> - The umbral dragon [[Sicnavier]] terrorizes [[Ustalav]] from its home in [[Virlych]].
> - In a repurposed [[Necromancy|necromancers]] sanctuary below the [[Umbral Basin]], the great wyrm [[Fahrauth]] has set his lair.
