> **Elementals** are creatures from one of the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]] that are made up completely of one of the four [[Element|elements]] of air, earth, fire or water. This means that they do not have anatomies and nervous systems as do most other creatures. As a result they cannot be stunned, poisoned or paralysed, do not breathe, eat, or sleep, and do not have a blind side or vulnerable areas that can be targeted by their enemies.



## Primal elementals

> **Primal elementals**, which are composed entirely of one elemental and look roughly [[Humanoid|humanoid]], are the most famous of all elementals. Many of them are named after natural disasters, and are often found in the wake of these disasters.
> The mixing of elements is seen to occur at the borders between the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]]. At these planar borders elemental creatures may be created from the [[Secondary element|secondary elements]] too.

## Other elementals

*See also: [[CategoryElemental subtype creatures]]Â and [[CategoryElemental creatures]]*
> There are a number of other types of elemental creature, which typically have more defined forms than the primal elementals.


### Elemental creatures

> Some elementals look and behave like [[Animal|animals]] from the [[Material Plane]], despite their lack of animalistic instincts like eating and reproducing. Due to their small size, ease of [[Summon|summoning]] and varied abilities, they tend to be favoured by [[Magic/Conjuration|conjurers]].


### Civilised elementals

> Some elementals have cultures and personalities of their own that distinguish them from their simple cousins. These so-called civilised elementals often live alongside [[Genie|genies]] or in large settlements.


### Monstrous elementals

> More than simple incarnations of the elements, some elementals have complex ecologies and societies, and can often be found on the Material Plane in addition to their native plane.


## On Golarion


### Osirion

> Elementals are associated with the deserts of [[Osirion]]. 
> [[Khemet I|Khemet Is]] alliance with the country's elder elementals was a key factor in his ability to gain the throne of the country by a bloodless coup. His grandson, [[Khemet III]], is often accompanied by his [[Fire elemental|fire elemental]] advisor [[Janhelia]], and some at court fear that the country is on the verge of becoming embroiled in the complex politics of the elemental clans.
