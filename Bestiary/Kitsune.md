## Appearance

> Kitsune are natural shapechangers and possess two different forms. Their natural form is that of an anthropomorphic fox while their alternate form is an attractive humanoid with a slender build and piercing eyes.


## Adventurers

> Kitsune often succeed as [[Rogue|rogues]], [[Investigator|investigators]], and [[Bard's End|bards]]. Kitsune who practise their magical abilities tend more toward [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]] or [[Oracle|oracles]], and those who forge a stronger connection to the spirits may become witches.


## On Golarion

> Small communities of kitsune are known to dwell within the depths of the [[Forest of Spirits]], they are the only humanoids whose settlements the [[Kami|kami]] are willing to tolerate in the heart of the forest itself, all other communities are restricted to only the forest's outskirts.
