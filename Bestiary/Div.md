> **Divs** are a race of fiends native to [[Abaddon]] that exist only to cause harm and destruction. Closely related to [[Daemon|daemons]] and the other [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]] of the [[Outer Sphere]], many planar scholars believe them to be descended from the spirits of the first evil [[Genie|genies]]. These creatures vary in power, yet all have similar traits that link them, such as telepathy, summoning powers, energy immunities and resistances. They generally speak [[Languages of the Great BeyondAbyssal|Abyssal]], [[Languages of the Great BeyondCelestial|Celestial]] and [[Languages of the Great BeyondInfernal|Infernal]].
> [[Ahriman]] is the most powerful div and rules as their supreme lord.


## Types of divs

[[Doru]]
Doru take the form of floating heads with writhing hair, bestial teeth and huge horns and serve their more powerful brethren as messengers and spies.
[[Ghawwas]]
Fearsome menaces of the ocean that have the ability to walk on land as well. Ghawwas are the bane of all sailors.
[[Pairaka]]
The androgynous pairakas, embodiments of corruption and disease, manipulate human sexuality and taboo desires and break down relationships.
[[Shira]]
The fearsome shiras revel in the joy of the hunt, stalking only the most canny of foes, as anything else is a waste of their exceptional talent.
[[Sepid]]
Hulking tyrants that use their physical strength to dominate weaker creatures, Sepids make for truly fearsome opponents.
[[Druj nasu]]
Foul corruptors of the dead, druj nasus are divs that haunt funeral pyres, mausoleums, and burial sites to steal corpses.
