> **Jiang-shis** are a race of [[Vampire|vampires]] who feed on the "chi" or life energy of living creatures by inhaling their breath. They are also known as **hopping vampires** due to their unusual method of locomotion.



## Appearance

> A jiang-shi retains its appearance at the time of reanimation. Each has a short prayer scroll affixed to its brow by stitches, which protects it from [[Magic item|magic items]], and usually wears out-of-date clothing. Because of rigor mortis, the jiang-shi's movement is especially stiff: it moves exclusively by hopping, and can be surprisingly nimble in difficult terrain.


## Ecology

> A jiang-shi is created when a restless spirit stays in its corpse after death, which decays until the jiang-shi rises from its grave to seek living prey. Jiang-shis are terrified by mirrors, the sound of a handbell, and cooked rice (which mocks the jiang-shis by reminding them that they can no longer eat). Although they prefer darkness and try to avoid [[Sun|sunlight]], jiang-shi vampires are not harmed by it like [[Moroi|moroi]] vampires, but they can be destroyed by peach wood, or if they are defeated and crumble into dust, which is then scattered or mixed with cooked rice and vinegar.


## History

> Jiang-shi, like all true vampires, trace their ancestry to the [[Strigoi|strigoi]], an ancient strain of vampires that entered the [[Material Plane]] from the [[Shadow Plane]] in ancient times. These ancient vampires first evolved into the [[Nosferatu|nosferatu]], with the [[Moroi|moroi]] vampires in turn arising from vampires who rejected the bestial lives of their nosferatu forebears. Some moroi went into hibernation for unclear reasons, emerging millennia later starving and half-mad. Driven by their intense desires and hungers, they began to consume the life essence in the very breath of their victims, becoming the first jiang-shis.
