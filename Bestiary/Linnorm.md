> **Linnorms** are a family of gigantic, wingless [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dragon|dragons]] with long [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|serpentine]] bodies, and who live in the far northern reaches of [[Avistan]]. Despite their lack of wings, linnorms are capable of [[Magic|magical]] fight. They were the original draconic race on [[Golarion]], having existed here for eons before the arrival of the "[[True dragon|true dragons]]" millennia ago.
> Like true dragons, linnorms possess a terrible breath weapon. Unlike their cousins, however, they are not innate [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]]. Instead, they have a strange connection to the [[First World]] of the [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/fey|fey]], and are able to pass between [[Material Plane|our world]] and theirs and lay dying [[Curse|curses]] on those who slay them. Linnorms that still reside in the First World claim that they are the ancestors of all modern dragons. Many consider the [[Eldest]] [[Ragadahn]] as the father of the first linnorms.

## Species of linnorm

> A number of species of linnorm are known to exist:
> - [[Cairn linnorm]]
> - [[Crag linnorm]]
> - [[Fjord linnorm]]
> - [[Gare linnorm]]
> - [[Ice linnorm]]
> - [[Taiga linnorm]]
> - [[Tarn linnorm]]
> - [[Tor linnorm]]
> Other species, such as the water, snow, slate, and mire are rumored, but it is not known whether these denote distinct species, or are simply different names for some of those mentioned above.

## Abilities

![[Linnorm_hoard.jpg|right+hmed]]

> Different types of linnorm have a number of abilities in common:
> - Every linnorm type has a particular death curse that affects any creature that slays a linnorm.
> - They have a boon equivalent to a constant *freedom of movement* [[Spell|spell]].
> - They cannot be physically constrained.
> - They are unaffected by mind-affecting magic.
> - They are immune to curses.
> - They see through [[Illusion|illusions]] and magical disguises as though a *true seeing* spell constantly affects them.
> - They can resist most other spells.
> - They resist damage from [[Weapon|weapons]] and are able to regenerate any damage they do suffer.
> - They have venomous bites and breath weapons.
> In keeping with their [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/fey|fey]] connection, [[Cold iron|cold iron]] weapons are also [[Anathema|anathematic]] to them, and they are unable to regenerate wounds caused by such weapons.

## On Golarion

> Linnorms are greatly feared and respected by the populace of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. Like that nation's name suggests, a potential ruler must carry a linnorm's head through the city gate in order to secure a mandate to rule. Within that same nation resides the "Father of all Linnorms": [[Fafnheir]]. In distant [[Vudra]], many linnorms are found in the [[Pardaparbat Mountains]] near the valley of [[Viritash's Tail|Viritashs Tail]]. Here, they fight with each other and other corrupted dragons for control of a powerful, unholy [[Artifact|artifact]] of the Vudran dragon god [[Viritash]].
