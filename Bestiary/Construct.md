> A **construct** is a type of creature so named because it is *constructed* rather than born: it is given the semblance of life using means other than [[Necromancy|necromancy]]. Such animated creatures have no [[Soul|soul]], and do not inherently need to breathe, eat, or sleep. A [[Golem|golem]] is a particular type of construct.
