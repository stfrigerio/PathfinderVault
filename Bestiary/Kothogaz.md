> **Unyielding Kothogaz**, the **Dance of Disharmony**, is one of the [[Spawn of Rovagug]]. It arrived in [[Vudra]] in [[345 AR]] from [[Casmaron]] and proceeded to rampage across the land.



## Appearance

> Surviving parts of the acid-sourged Ezida Scrolls provide a most detailed known description of it: a shell like a horned beetle's: veined wings of broken glass; a torso resembling a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] with a slug-like abdomen and moist, chitinous armor; four arms, two tipped in pincers; a drooling maw that forms most of its head; and dozens of eyes arrayed above its mouth.


## History

> Kothogaz was first spotted near old Ezida, then a city of [[Ninshabur]]. Hathga-Tah the Ninshaburite also described Kothogaz as "pus of raw and bursted wounds" in their list of the Spawn of Rovagug.
> A bite from Kothogaz is blamed for the disfigurement and madness of the [[Gold dragon|gold dragon]] [[Trilochan]] in the [[Narhari Desert]].
> The squabbling mahajanapadas united for the first time but were overwhelmed one after the other in the desperate fight against the beast. The legendary hero [[Khiben-Sald]], whom the current maharajah claims as an ancestor, is said to be a descendent from these rulers. The fighting continued until the legendary psychic [[Vanitapati]] confronted Kothogaz. Psychics, occultists, sorcerers, and countless common people lent Vanitapati their strength through meditation and prayer. Legend claims her psychic avatar stood as tall as a mountain to rip Kothogaz to pieces. It is said that the battle claimed a million [[Vudrani]] lives but ultimately the hero-priests cast it into the ocean and boiled the ocean, weakening it to the point where the creature's heart could be extracted.
> The heart is now in 101 pieces, and the largest is said to lie beneath [[Padiskar]] on Jalmeray.
> Kothogaz is said to have scattered three pieces of the *[[Champion of the Gilded Host]]*, a powerful [[Construct|construct]], when it trampled across Vudra.


## In culture

> Kothogaz is not well-known in [[Avistan]]. Its tales are retold primarily in [[Nex]], and (amongst the reactionaries who revived it) [[Ezida]]. In Vudra, where it is best known, it is a crime to speak of it, nor is it recommended for visitors to inquire after it in Vudra's outpost of [[Jalmeray]].
> Many legends exist detailing methods of Kothogaz's final destruction, and one of them uses part of Kothogaz's heart.
