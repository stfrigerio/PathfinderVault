---> A **moss pig** looks very similar to othe[](PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Level%201/Pig.md)]] from the forest, the only differences are the long strands of fungus and moss hanging from their sides and tusks and a mottled, hairy coat. These pigs live in the swamp, traveling in herds. The moss and fungus on their sides and tusks come from rubbing on the swamp's trees.
