> **Aphorites** are a race of native [[Outsider|outsiders]] created by the [[Axiomite|axiomites]] as [[Mortal|mortal]] proxies to facilitate their interaction with mortals.



## Appearance

> The first aphorites possessed nearly uniform physical appearances, but they have diversified after generations spent on the [[Material Plane]]. Modern aphorites have flickering, coruscating golden skin, sparkling with crystalline dust; and metallic eyes and hair; but can appear as any appropriately sized [[Humanoid|humanoid]]. Bigger and smaller aphorites are rare due to the [[Lawful|lawful]] influence of [[Axis]], but such exceptions have become increasingly more frequent.


## Personality

> Aphorites are smart, strong, but somewhat stiff, and their ordered and structured personalities can conflict with [[Chaotic|chaotic]] races like [[Elf|elves]]. Conversely, aphorites build strong bonds with lawful races, especially [[Dwarf|dwarves]], who enjoy their company and welcome aphorite births due to their intuitive understanding of dwarven craft.
> Aphorites can recognise the difference between [[Good|good]] and [[Evil|evil]], but they find this dichotomy less clear cut and less influential than that between law and chaos.


### Adventurers

> The aphorite's precision leads many to become [[Investigator|investigators]] or [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]]. Similar faculties lead them to become [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemists]], [[Oracle|oracles]], or [[Wizard|wizards]].


## History

> The original aphorites were forged in Axis by axiomites as intermediaries between themselves and mortals. Being creatures of law, the axiomites find it difficult to deal with creatures with the free will to choose their own destinies and to interpret or ignore laws. The aphorites were a fusion of the axiomites' lawful perfection, in the form of Axis's ordered [[Planar essence|essence]], with the unpredictability of mortals.


## Ecology

> Unlike [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aasimar|aasimars]] or [[Tiefling|tieflings]], aphorites are born to aphorite parents and are not the results of unions between outsiders and mortals. If an aphorite interbreeds with a humanoid race, the offspring is either an aphorite or a member of the other parent's race.


## Habitat and society

> Aphorites are rare on most Material Plane worlds. The first aphorites on [[Golarion]] sought to to integrate into established societies to help guide the formation of laws and bolster interactions with Axis. However, being mortals with free will, many aphorites became intrigued by these societies, and some embraced chaos: those who do are considered outcasts by other aphorites. Chaotic aphorites tend to be loners and have little interest in aphorite traditions, preferring to seek out other societies.
> The rare aphorites in Axis tend to be utterly forgettable or legendary, having chosen to live there out of complacency or after incredible exploits.


### Religion

> [[Abadar]] is the most common patron [[Deity|deity]] of religious aphorites, who find his worship resonating with their inherent goals of building a perfect society.


### Language

> Aphorites speak either [[Languages of the Great Beyond|Celestial or Infernal]]. The name of each individual aphorite typically reflects the society they are raised in.
