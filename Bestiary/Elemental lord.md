![[Ymeri.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 The elemental lord of fire, Ymeri.
> An **elemental lord** is a [[Deity|divine]] being birthed from, and made of the substance of one of the four [[Elemental Plane|elemental planes]]. As [[Demigod|demigods]], they have worshipers amongst creatures of their [[Element|element]]. For most of history, there was no balance between [[Good|good]] and [[Evil|evil]] among the elemental lords (unlike elsewhere in the [[Great Beyond]]), as the evil elemental lords defeated and sealed away their good rivals long ago, and the good elemental lords were only recently freed from imprisonment. The evil elemental lords seem to embody the worst qualities of fire, water, wind, and earth, and are fickle and dangerous.



## History

> Many believe that the elemental planes were already ancient when the [[Material Plane]] first came into existence. Ruling these [[Plane|planes]] were eight beings that were masters of elemental creation and destruction: the elemental lords. The four evil lords, [[Ayrzul]], [[Hshurha]], [[Kelizandri]], and [[Ymeri]], were opposed by the four benign powers: [[Sairazul]], [[Ranginori]], [[Lysianassa]], and [[Atreia]]. Their abilities were so evenly matched, however, that none could overcome the other, and they existed in a state of volatile equilibrium. This all changed when the [[Deity|gods]] created the Material Plane and [[Mortality|mortal life]].
> The gods fashioned the Material Plane using the substance of the elemental planes. At first this was a one-sided transaction, but soon the elemental planes began receiving something in return: [[Soul|souls]] passing through them on their way to the [[Outer Planes]]. Where once the elemental planes had been unchanging, if mutable, foundational realms, they began to be imbued with mortal imagination, thought, and motive. Elemental beings began to be moved from their inherent [[Neutral|neutrality]], and none more so than the elemental lords.
> According to the [[Elemental|elementals]], when the Material Plane was young, the good elemental lords combined their powers to create [[Star|stars]], [[Planet|planets]], oceans, and life, while their evil rivals were too disunited to effectively resist. However, as mortals began to use the elements for evil, the good elemental lords started blaming each other, while the evil elemental lord Kelizandri managed to form a temporary pact with the three others, and together they defeated and imprisoned their good rivals in four [[World/Items & Equipment/Artifacts/Artifact|artifacts]]: the *[[Moaning Diamond]]*, the *[[Gasping Pearl]]*, the *[[Untouchable Opal]]* and the *Garnet Brand*.
> In [[4717 AR]], the good elemental lord Ranginori was freed by the [[Pathfinder Society]] and returned to his old realm, leading to conflicts that could escalate to planar wars.
