> Once every century, the [[Baba Yaga|Witch Queen Baba Yaga]] returns to the land of [[Irrisen]] and removes her daughter from the throne and quickly replaces her with another. These transitions are not always easy, as some of the crone's daughters in the past have refused to abdicate peacefully, but they always end with Baba Yaga taking the old queen with her in her *[[Baba Yaga's Dancing Hut|Dancing Hut]]*, never to be seen again. Most presume that they are taken to wherever Baba Yaga dwells beyond [[Golarion]], but the truth is far darker: they are imprisoned within the *Dancing Hut*, where their life force is slowly drained until they become undead mockeries of their former selves: crone queens.
