> **Hell gigas**, also known as **phyriphlegians** by [[Titan|titans]] and some other elder races, are [[Gigas|gigas]], a type of [[Giant|giant]], who dwell in [[Hell]].


## Appearance

> Hell gigas are gargantuan giants of enormous strength and heat who wear a second skin fashioned of bone, muscle, and [[Iron|iron]] that serves as [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]]. These creatures are covered in scars and wounds from innumerable battles. A Hell gigas generally stands about 50 feet high and weighs at least 20 tons.


## Habitat and ecology

> Most Hell gigas dwell in the mountains and wilderness of [[Avernus]], [[Phlegethon]], and outside the city of [[Dis]], in fiery demesnes running with lava in which they can focus on their petty tyrannies over lesser [[Devil|devils]] and lost [[Soul|souls]]. Hell gigas hate [[Fire giant|fire giants]], but delight in [[Slavery|enslaving]] them. Although they live in Hell, Hell gigas avoid devils to avoid entanglements with the infernal hierarchy.
