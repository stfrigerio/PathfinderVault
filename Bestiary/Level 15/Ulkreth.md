> **Ulkreths** are some of the most powerful followers of [[Xoveron]], the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of [[Gargoyle|gargoyles]] and ruins. Their primary goal is to fulfill their master's great ambition: the destruction of civilization itself.


## Appearance

> Ulkreths are [[Demon|demons]] of colossal size, standing upwards of 25 feet in height and weighing roughly 10 tons. They are bestial bipedal creatures with four arms that end in massive hands, skin that looks like rock and crooked metal, and curved, elongated horns sprouting from their head.


## Habitat, Ecology & Society

> Ulkreth demons are formed from the souls of mortals who in life revelled in senseless destruction on a massive scale.
