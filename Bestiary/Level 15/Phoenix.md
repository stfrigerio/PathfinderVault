*For another meaning of "Phoenix", please see Phoenix (horse).*
> A **phoenix** is a near-mythical [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird]] of extraordinary size and intelligence that seems to be composed of pure fire. It is best known for its ability to seemingly resurrect itself from its own dead body. Phoenixes are generally [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|benevolent]] creatures of great wisdom and learning, and are sometimes sought-out by those seeking advice or knowledge.



## Appearance

> Phoenixes resemble gigantic birds wreathed in flames, often with forty-foot wingspans. Although all phoenixes resemble gigantic birds seemingly made of fire, their appearance beyond that can vary a great deal. Many look like raptorial birds such as [[Hawk|hawks]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Eagle|eagles]], but the phoenixes of [[Garund|Garunds]] jungles and savannas resemble local tropical birds, while a rare few look like giant [[Owl|owls]]. Their coloring is also prone to some variety; while most have red to yellow plumage and flames, blue, green, and white phoenixes have also been recorded.


## Ecology

> Phoenixes, despite their benevolent natures, are also active predators. They typically hunt herding mammals such as antelopes, gazelles, deer, and [[Aurochs|aurochs]], which they prefer to consume raw. Although they can subsist on plant matter when they need to, they prefer the taste of meat. While they do not purposefully target intelligent beings, they are known to consume the bodies of slain foes in battle.
> Phoenixes are best known for the miraculous ability to return to life after being slain, although they can only resurrect themselves in this manner once a year. If a phoenix is killed before a full year has passed since its last resurrection, its death will be permanent.
> Phoenixes mate for life, although mated phoenixes spend most of their lives apart from one another, and breed once a century. A female phoenix will lay an egg roughly the size of a [[Wine|wine]] cask after mating, which the parents will incubate for six months. After this period, an infant phoenix already the size of an eagle emerges from the egg, and reaches the intelligence of an adult [[Human|human]] within a few days of its birth.


## Society

![[Phoenix_Warrior.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A Phoenix Warrior named after the fabled bird.
> Phoenixes are largely solitary creatures in regards to their own kind. Mated pairs typically only come together once a century to mate and care for their new offspring, leaving each other and their child after a few years. Phoenixes do not maintain contact with their parents again after leaving their nests, and will not usually interact with other phoenixes again except for their own future mates and chicks. When multiple adult phoenixes gather together, it is usually because a powerful [[Evil|evil]] force has arisen that cannot be confronted by a single phoenix.
> Although largely solitary and reclusive creatures, phoenixes enjoy the occasional company of [[Humanoid|humanoids]], particularly if these are morally upstanding or share the phoenixes' love for scholarship and knowledge. They are also known to form long-lasting friendships and alliances with [[Metallic dragon|metallic]] and [[Imperial dragon|imperial dragons]], with whom they share their long lifespans, love of knowledge, and desire to do good.
> Phoenixes have a strained relationship with [[Tidehawk|tidehawks]], another species of magical avians with a similar relationship with water as phoenixes have with fire. Although phoenixes and tidehawks are kin, their contrasting elemental alignments and moral outlooks make it difficult for them to get along. Phoenixes see tidehawks as flighty, selfish, and unreliable; in turn, tidehawks view phoenixes as self-righteous meddlers overly involved in mortal affairs. The two species only cooperate to respond to significant threats to natural environments caused by particularly evil beings.


## On Golarion

> Phoenixes are known to exist in [[Golarion|Golarions]] warmer climes. They are rarely spotted in the hills of the [[Mwangi Expanse]], the deserts of [[Osirion]], [[Katapesh]], and [[Qadira]], and are especially prevalent in the eastern parts of the latter nation.
> Phoenixes play an important role in [[Sarenrae|Sarenite]] theology. The faithful of Sarenrae believe that seeing a phoenix is a sign of great favor from the [[Deity|goddess]], and therefore treat the creature with great reverence. Further, a passage from *The Birth of Light and Truth*, Sarenrae's holy text, indicates that the first phoenixes were created when the goddess raised a flock of [[Roc|rocs]] to sapience and blessed them with her fires when they pledged to serve her.
> The [[Worldwound]] is home to a corrupted, [[Evil|evil]] phoenix known as [[Pyralisia|Pyralisia the Rain of Embers]]. Pyralisia was a normal member of her species until she was killed while defending a *[[Wardstone|wardstone]]* from an [[Abyss|Abyssal]] rift. Although the rift was successfully closed, the Abyssal energies it emanated corrupted Pyralisia's rebirth and resurrected her as a creature consumed by [[Chaos|chaos]] and evil.
