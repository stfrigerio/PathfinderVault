> Darvakka[[Shadow]][[Undead]]
*For another meaning of "Nightwalker", please see [[Nightwalker]].*
> **Sykevers**, usually called **nightwalkers**, are the most commonly encountered type of [[Darvakka|darvakka]].


## Appearance

![[Deploying_the_tathlum.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Sykevers in action on the field of battle.
> The sykever is a night-black giant with [[Demon|demonic]] features, including a huge pair of [[Sheep|ram-like]] horns and arms that end in massive blades. A sykever is 20 feet tall and weighs 5,000 pounds.


## Ecology

> Sykevers lead armies of [[Undead|undead]] against the living. Unlike [[Mortal|mortal]] generals, sykevers prefer to take part in battles rather than observing them from afar in safety, unless the battles are deemed by the sykever as self-destructive. This does not mean that the sykever never sacrifices its troops to gain a tactical advantage. Sykevers enjoy inflicting despair before death, particularly by destroying valued objects or murdering loved ones before finishing the foe off.
