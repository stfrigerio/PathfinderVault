    desc: "  A jotund troll ordinarily has nine heads, and they can use regeneration to regrow a head that is severed from an effect like a vorpal weapon. After regaining Hit Points from regeneration, the jotund troll attempts a DC 8 flat check. On a success, one missing head is fully restored; on a critical success, two missing heads are fully restored. If a jotund troll loses their last remaining head, they die immediately."
  - name: "Multiple Opportunities"
    desc: "  A jotund troll gains an extra reaction per round for each of their heads beyond the first, which they can use only to make Attacks of Opportunity with their jaws or to Fast Swallow. They can't use more than 1 reaction for the same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares within their reach, and the jotund troll must use a different head for each [[Attack of Opportunity]] they make. Whenever one of the jotund troll's heads is severed, the troll loses 1 of their extra reactions per round."

> **Jotund trolls** are fearsome, nine-headed [[Troll|trolls]] of unclear origins.



## Ecology

> Jotund trolls are solitary, and do not keep each other's company. They are mostly found in isolated moors, marshes, and other wastelands. A jotund troll's heads typically work in unison with one another, but tend to argue and bicker over which one gets to eat the creature's meals.


## Origins

> The origins of jotund trolls are not uniformly agreed upon. Popular wisdom considers them to represent the original form that the troll species had when it first emerged in the world, and to originate from [[Jotungard]], a mythical realm said to be located in a remote part of [[Elysium]], from which they were released as either a punishment or challenge for [[Mortal|mortals]]. Another view notes that jotund trolls are chiefly found in areas of intense [[Magic|magical]] or [[Technological|technological]] pollution, and considers them to have been altered from normal trolls by exposure to life-altering influences in these locations.


## In Golarion

> Jotund trolls are rarely seen in [[Golarion]], but are known to occur with particular frequency in the magically warped [[Mana Wastes]] and the [[Radiation|radiation]]-scoured wastes of [[Numeria]].
