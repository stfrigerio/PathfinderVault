> **Thoughtmaws** are the rare [[Xulgath|xulgaths]] who did not lose the intellect and [[Occult magic|occult power]] that their ancestors once possessed long before the collapse of the ancient xulgath empire. They are the only xulgaths who have managed to remember the name for their own species.



## Appearance

> Most thoughtmaws are nearly six feet tall and weigh 200 pounds. They have strongly reptilian features, including taloned feet and a spiked crest.


## Abilities

> Instead of the foul stench of regular xulgaths, thoughtmaws exude an oily psychogenic secretion that is physically odorless but triggers memories of the foulest stench a creature has ever experienced. This substance also fuels a form of [[Telepathic|telepathic]] communication shared among thoughtmaws.


## Society

> Thoughtmaws are often found leading large xulgath clutches in the [[Darklands]]. In these clutches, [[Xulgath deepmouth|deepmouths]] usually serve thoughtmaws as advisors or tend to lay followers, although some thoughtmaws see no need for [[Demon|demonic]] assistance and ban deepmouths entirely.
> A small population of thoughtmaws lives in [[Deep Tolguth]]. Less savage, but no less vile than their degenerate cousins, these xulgaths use their intelligence to [[Slavery|enslave]] other races and tame beasts as mounts and guards. They view regular xulgaths as weak cast-offs without the blessing of [[Zevgavizeb]] and kill them on sight, though many of these xulgaths still hope for acceptance by their enlightened kin and effectively protect thoughtmaw settlements from invaders, notably [[Orc|orcs]].


## Variants

> A few powerful individuals survived the fall of the xulgath empire and sought refuge in magical stasis. Some have awakened and tried to re-elevate modern xulgaths to rebuild their lost empire, but most despise their savage kin. These so-called xulgath paragons have glowing, emerald eyes and gold-tinged scales, live for 400 years on average, and are extremely paranoid.
