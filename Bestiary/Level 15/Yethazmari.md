> **Yethazmari** is the [[Herald|herald]] of the [[Demon|demon-goddess]] [[Lamashtu]], and appears as a terrible combination of a [[Jackal|jackal]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake]] with wings. At some point in the past, it mated with an abnormally large [[Bulette|bulette]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]; the offspring was a monster known as the [[Juggerloathe]], which still lives in the Hold in the present day.
