> The **Night Monarch** is the divine [[Herald|herald]] of the [[Deity|goddess]] [[Desna]]. While known as a goddess of dreams and travel, her herald is more than capable of defending Desna's faithful when necessary.



## Appearance

> The Night Monarch looks like an enormous winged insectoid with a wingspan of 40 feet. Its wings are brightly colored, and while the exact color and pattern changes with every sighting, they always exude sparkling stardust. Its head looks more like a brightly colored [[Moth|moth]] than a [[Butterfly|butterfly]], and its tail ends in what look like three [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|peacock]] feathers.


## Habitat and ecology

> As a herald, the Night Monarch goes wherever Desna commands and does not have a fixed habitat. Similarly, the [[Star Monarch|star monarchs]] habitat is unknown. As an [[Outsider|outsider]], the Night Monarch is not a part of the natural order, though butterflies and moths seem to be attracted to it and accompany it in flight.

> Believed to be the semi-divine offspring of the Night Monarch, star monarchs are a race of rare butterfly-like creatures. They resemble their progenitor in appearance but lack the Night Monarch's advanced intelligence. Most people on [[Golarion]], and especially followers of Desna, consider seeing a star monarch to be a sign of good luck.
