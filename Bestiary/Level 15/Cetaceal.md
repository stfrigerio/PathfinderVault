> **Cetaceals** are a race of aquatic [[Agathion|agathions]] who protect the waters of [[Nirvana]] from evil interlopers, and occasionally leave their home plane to serve as guardians for lakes, rivers, and oceans on other planes. They appear as giant, humanoid women from the waist up, but with the lower body of [[Orca|orcas]].


## Cetaceals on Nirvana

> Cetaceals have been spotted in a number of Nirvana's bodies of water, including the Lake of Spring-Thawed Ice and the [[Sea of No Shadows]].
