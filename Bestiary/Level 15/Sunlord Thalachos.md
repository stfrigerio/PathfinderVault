> **Sunlord Thalachos** is [[Sarenrae|Sarenraes]] [[Angel|angelic]] [[Herald|herald]], acting as liaison to the mortal world, the hosts of [[Astral deva|astral devas]], and the ranks of superior angels (including the [[Empyreal Lord|Empyreal Lords]]).


## Appearance

> Sunlord Thalachos stands 8 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds, an impressive figure with a strong, deep voice. His metallic skin is as hard as steel to any that wish to do him harm, but as soft as velvet to anyone kind, merciful, and good.  He has four arms in which he wields two flaming scimitars and a holy bow.


## Ecology

> He is the champion of the Dawnflower in [[Golarion]] and her favorite last-resort weapon against the spawn of [[Rovagug]]. Before the death of [[Aroden]] he often delivered prophecies on behalf of the goddess, and several stories in *The Birth of Light and Truth* were penned by oracles whom he personally escorted through Sarenrae's realm. Now the only similar duty he bears is appearing at auspicious births.
