> **Hungerers** are the ancient weapons created by the [[Runelord of Greed]]. Warped in the flesh pits of [[Xin-Shalast]] these monstrous abominations of warped flesh were once [[Harridan|harridans]], favoured servants of the runelord Karzoug. 


## Appearance

> Hungerers are a huge, blubbery masses of flesh. They resemble the harridans they were created from except their frame has been overwhelmed by the massive corpulent weight added by their transformation. Even their flesh seems strained by the transformation as in many cases it is secured by massive iron staples that seem ready to burst under the strain. The hungerer still has its four leonine legs but they too are swollen with flesh and can barely support the hungerers weight and are no longer usable as weapons. Their mouths are one of their most disgusting features as they are huge teeth filled chasms with the bottom jaw resting on the hungerers chest. Due to their fleshy bulk hungerers often weigh well over twenty thousand pounds.


## Habitat & Ecology

> Hungerers are only ever found near the peaks of Xin-Shalast and even then they are only a recent arrival being released from stasis when Karzoug himself was awoken. In the time between the fall of [[Thassilon]] and the reawakening of Karzoug the hungerers were completely unknown, another beast condemned to myth. It is possible that hungerers may still exist in other Thassilon vaults locked in stasis waiting to be re-awakened. As creations of Xin-Shalast's fleshpits hungerers are wholly unnatural creatures. They are named for their insatiable hunger, they can eat almost anything and while they prefer to rend meat from bone they can survive on any organic material and even gnaw on rocks and metal.
