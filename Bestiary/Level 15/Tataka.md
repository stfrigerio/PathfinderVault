> **Tatakas** are a species of unsubtle [[Rakshasa|rakshasa]] [[Philosopher|philosophers]] who fanatically serve the [[Rakshasa immortal|rakshasa immortals]].


## Appearance

> A tataka resembles a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] with backward-facing hands and a feral, [[Animal|animal]]-like visage with exaggerated features. The largest of their kind, a typical tataka is 12 feet tall and weighs 1,300 pounds.


## Ecology

> From a young age, tatakas train in martial arts. They might assault sacred sites or rituals directly to foil good works and kill [[Holy|holy]] people. Outside of rakshasa worship, tatakas have nothing but contempt for religion, and mock and assault any who disagree. Their familiarity with religion makes them excellent corruptors and blasphemers.
