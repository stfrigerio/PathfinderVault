> **Whyrlishes** are giant [[Jellyfish|jellyfish]]-like creatures native to the [[Astral Plane]], where they feed on the [[Metaphysical|metaphysical]] energies of the [[River of Souls]]. This process does no harm to the [[Soul|souls]] in the river, but often puts whyrlishes at odds with would-be harvesters of souls, who often have to deal with them. A typical whyrlish is 30 feet long (including tentacles), and weighs about 2,500 pounds.
