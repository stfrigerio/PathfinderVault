> A **nemhaith**, sometimes termed a **nemhain**, is a powerful type of [[Undead|undead]] that is deliberately created to serve as a guardian of a person, an object, a place, or an ideal to which the living person had devoted their life.



## Appearance

> A nemhaith looks like and ancient and dessicated corpse that is surrounded by a disembodied horde of bound spirits that the nemhaith can direct to attack its enemies.


## Habitat & Ecology

> Nemhaiths are created by ancient, powerful, and profane [[Ritual|rituals]] that have, for the most part, been lost to ancient history. A devotee is willingly sacrificed along with a slew of their friends and family who normally are not so willing. The nemhaith created then serves as a devoted, deathless guardian. Most people who become a nemhaith were [[Evil|evil]] in the first place, most often worshippers of dark, secret [[Deity|gods]] or the guardians of profane secrets. Occasionally a [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|goodly]] individual would undertake this transformation in a misguided attempt to guard something they believed was supremely important. The ritual itself is so steeped in evil that doing so always creates an unholy abomination.
> A nemhaith can grow more powerful by draining the life of living creatures and incorporating their [[Soul|souls]] into itself.


## On Golarion

> Amongst the wilds of the [[Porthmos Gap]] in eastern [[Taldor]] lies the [[House of the Senses Awakened]]. Here, a powerful nemhaith named Origen Sarlu dwells, having turned the former pleasure palace into a trap-laden mausoleum guarded by undead like [[Spectre|spectres]], [[Wight|wights]], and [[Wraith|wraiths]], and even some ancient [[Stone golem|stone golems]]. So strong is Origen's devotion to the deceased [[Cydonus III|Grand Prince Cydonus III]], that none has penetrated the House of the Senses Awakened since Origen turned it into the Grand Prince's tomb in [[4081 AR]].
