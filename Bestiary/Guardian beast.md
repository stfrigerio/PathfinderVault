> **Guardian beasts** (or **foo creatures**) are [[Celestial|celestials]] that resemble types of [[Animal|animals]] on the [[Material Plane]], and sometimes travel to or are [[Summon|summoned]] to it to serve as guardians. They are the most numerous form of ascended [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] in [[Nirvana]], where they enjoy aiding [[Agathion|agathions]] and playing with others of their kindâ€”even those that look like natural predators of their own form.



## Appearance

> Any type of animal can serve as the basis of a guardian beastâ€”indeed, every type of animal has a guardian counterpart somewhere in Nirvana. [[Lion|Lions]] are some of the most common forms taken by guardian beasts, while [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|dogs]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fox|foxes]] are common in [[Minkai]] and in shrines to [[Daikitsu]], respectively. However, with faces that more closely resemble a [[Humanoid|humanoids]], they are rarely confused with their mundane counterparts.
> Artisans carve statues in the guardian beasts' likeness to serve as anchors, allowing them to remain on the Material Plane. By day, they pretend to be normal statues; at night, they either patrol the area, or leave their vessels visit places unreachable by a solid body. During this time, some send dream messages to friendly individuals, but these messages tend to be obscure due to the guardian beasts' personality and strange assumptions.
> Guardian beasts usually appear in bonded pairs with opposing personalities: nurturing and strict, or playful and serious. Sculptors often depict one stone animal with their young, though the latter tend to be less than dependable guardians due to their child-like nature, and need to be controlled by their parents.


## Abilities

> Guardian beasts are significantly smarter than their animal counterparts, with a level of intelligence nearly approaching that of some [[Human|humans]]. They can converse in [[Celestial language|Celestial]] and [[Taldane]], and can understand and follow complicated instructions.
> Guardian beasts can also turn their skin into hard stone and stand perfectly still for indefinite lengths of time. Along with their exaggerated features, guardian beasts can resemble statues so convincingly that they can hide in plain sight.


## Ecology

> Guardian beasts enjoy frolicking in Nirvana but are more serious when encountered on the Material Plane. They freely cooperate with kind, respectful visitors. They faithfully guard a site, regardless of how disused it is, until their own statues become uninhabitable due to wear or damage.
> Guardian beasts can serve as mounts but dislike doing so, and also hate war.


## Imperial guardian beasts

> Each species of guardian beast is led by a powerful **imperial guardian beast**, or **imperial foo creature**, who possesses additional [[Magic|magical]] powers. Only one imperial guardian beast of each type exists at a time. When an imperial guardian beast is killed, the next strongest one of the same species ascends to replace it.
