## Adventurers

> Leshies often become [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] (especially of leaf order) and [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]] due to their exceptional connection to nature. [[Bard's End]] is also a good fit for leshies with a love of storytelling; such leshies often inhabit vine leshy bodies.
