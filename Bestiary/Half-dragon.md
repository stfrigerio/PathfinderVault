> **Half-dragons** are the result of cross-breeding between [[Dragon|dragons]] and other beings. Dragons rarely deign to willingly mate with creatures not of their kind, so most half-dragons are the result of experiments by [[Wizard|wizards]] and cultists. The most common exception to this rule are [[Blue dragon|blue dragons]], who sometimes breed half-dragon offspring to help them control their domains.
> Half-dragons resemble powerful examples of the creatures they are spawned from, with draconic features such as scales and leathery wings. They have a weaker version of their draconic parent's breath weapon.
> Most half-dragons breed true, creating new races of monsters such as the [[Dracolisk|dracolisk]].


## On Golarion

> The [[Crystal dragon|crystal dragon]] [[Messentrel|Messentrel the Purple]] rules an empire of [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and [[Mephit|mephits]] on the [[Plane of Earth]], using his half-dragon offspring as proxy rulers.
