*For a list of known outsider races seen on Golarion, see [[CategoryOutsiders]].*
> While an **outsider** is generally a person not belonging to the group or locality of the speaker, the term is also used on [[Golarion]] to refer a being not native to the world, whether from one of the other [[Planet|planets]] in the [[Solar system|solar system]] or another [[Plane|plane]] of existence in the [[Great Beyond]].
> However, in its most technical sense, an outsider is a being that is at least partially made up of the [[Quintessence|quintessence]] of a plane other than the [[Material Plane]]. Unlike most other living creatures, an outsider does not have a [[Soul|soul]] separate from its body.
> Aside from [[Native Outsiders|native outsiders]], outsiders do not need to eat or sleep.



## Death

> Outsiders do not die of old age in the same way [[Mortal|mortals]] do. Instead, an outsider that grows weary or loses focus eventually melds into its home plane, adding its essence to that realm.


## Outsider types

> There are many different kinds of outsider, but they can be broadly split into three categories: [[Inner Sphere]], [[Outer Sphere]], and native outsiders.


### Inner Sphere

 An [[Earth elemental|earth elemental]] is one of many Inner Sphere outsiders.
> Outsiders from the [[Great BeyondInner Sphere|Inner Sphere]] are typically from one of the [[Elemental Plane|elemental planes]]. [[Elemental|Elementals]] and [[Genie|genies]] are perhaps the most well-known Inner Sphere outsiders on Golarion.

### Outer Sphere

 The [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] [[Ragathiel]] leads an assault on [[Evil|evil]] [[Outer Sphere]] outsiders.
> Outsiders from the [[Great BeyondOuter Sphere|Outer Sphere]] are usually strongly associated with the moral ([[Good|good]] or [[Evil|evil]]) and ethical ([[Law|law]] or [[Chaos|chaos]]) outlook of their home plane. These outsiders include the following broad races.

> - [[Aeon|Aeons]] were strictly neutral with respect to good, evil, law, and chaos
> - [[Agathion|Agathions]] are associated with good
> - [[Angel|Angels]] are associated with good, and may favour law, chaos or neither

> - [[Asura|Asuras]] are associated with evil and law
> - [[PathfinderWiki/Culture/Races/Azata|Azatas]] are associated with chaos and good
> - [[Daemon|Daemons]] are associated with evil
> - [[Demodand|Demodands]] are associated with evil and chaos

### Native outsiders

![[Half-celestial_unicorn.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 This [[Unicorn|unicorn]] is a [[Half-celestial|half-celestial]] creature, which is a type of native outsider.
> All outsiders are native to the plane of their creation. Some outsiders have a strong enough link to the Material Plane to be considered native to it. For example, most native outsiders have mortal ancestors. Unlike other outsiders, these creatures are native to the Material Plane and need to eat and sleep. They can also be brought back from the dead by powerful [[Magic|magic]] in the same way as mortals.

*For a list of native outsider races, see [[CategoryNative subtype creatures]].*
> Broad groupings of native outsiders include:

> - [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aasimar]]
> - [[Kami]]
> - [[Oni]]
> - [[Rakshasa|Rakshasas]]
> - [[Tiefling]]
