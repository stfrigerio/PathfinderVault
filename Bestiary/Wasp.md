> **Wasps** are aggressive flying insects with a painful sting. They range in size from a fraction of an inch to several inches. Individual wasps are generally not dangerous to the average [[Humanoid|humanoid]], but when they mass in huge **wasp swarms** of several thousand, they can become a serious hazard.



## Religion


### Calistria

> The wasp is the sacred animal of [[Calistria]]: the [[Deity|goddess]] of lust, revenge, and trickery. Calistria's [[Herald|herald]], the [[Menotherian]], resembles a gigantic wasp with prehensile hands at the end of its forelegs. Sometimes followers of Calistria acquire a wasp as a [[Familiar|familiar]].



## Giant wasps


> **Giant wasps** are [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse-sized]] varieties of their smaller cousins.
