> **Caligni** is both an ancient umbrella term for the [[Humanoid|humanoids]] that surface-dwellers call **dark folk**, as well as a word that specifically refers to genetic throwbacks among their kind who more closely resemble their [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] ancestors.



## Appearance

> Dark folk, although separated into distinct forms, share certain characteristics. All are dirty [[Humanoid|humanoid]] creatures, although stalkers are taller than both creepers and dancers. Most wear tattered grey or black clothing and hide shiny small treasures within them. They have gaunt builds with pale complexions and white eyes.


## History

> Dark folk are descended from the residents of the [[Azlant|Azlanti]] settlement of Calignos, a trading outpost located in the [[Mindspin Mountains]]. Just a day before [[Earthfall]], the seers in Calignos predicted their city's destruction and led their people into the Darklands for refuge. As Earthfall collapsed the tunnels leading to the surface, the citizens of Calignos were forced deeper underground.
> They found the Darklands to be a terrifying and dangerous place, and relied more and more on the power of [[Magic|magic]] to help in their survival, particularly the magic found in the borders between light and darkness. Their prayers were answered by a mysterious pantheon of [[Demigod|demigods]] known as the [[Forsaken]], who bestowed upon them the *[[Cradle of Night|Cradles of Night]]*. These [[Artifact|artifacts]] infused the citizens of Calignos with shadowy power, transforming them into a distinct race known as the dark folk.
> Unknown to the dark folk, the Forsaken were planning to draw upon their power in a plan to escape the [[Shadow Plane]]. Before this plan could be put in motion, the Forsaken suffered a mysterious calamity, shattering most *Cradles of Night* and leaving the dark folk once again without [[Deity|gods]]. However, after only a few years, the mysterious [[Owb|owbs]] appeared and offered their aid in exchange for devotion. The dark folk switched to worshipping the owbs, who bred them into specialised sub-races. In time, tales of the Forsaken and the surface were forgotten, and their ancestral home became an object of myth and legend to the dark folk.


## Ecology

> Dark folk subsist on rotting meat and [[Fungi|fungi]], supplementing their diet by being able to absorb light in small amounts and somehow converting it into nutrition. Intense light blinds and sickens them, as it overwhelms their ability to absorb it. Upon death, this stored light is released in a single blinding flash. This burst was said to have been part of a deal struck with the [[Forsaken]] [[Demigod|demigods]] that shaped their underground adaptations; in return, a sliver of their [[Soul|souls]] energy would fuel the Forsaken pantheon. However, the Forsaken by all measures disappeared long ago, and caligni soul energy is no longer tithed to them upon death.


### Forms

> During the [[Age of Darkness]], dark folk were split into several morphologically distinct groups, including the intermediary [[Dark dancer|dark dancers]], the more numerous [[Dark creeper|dark creepers]], and the larger and more commanding [[Dark stalker|dark stalkers]].
> Dark folk occasionally give birth to a child with an uncanny similarity to the [[Human|humans]] from Calignos, their home before they escaped into the Darklands to avoid Earthfall and were transformed by [[Owb|owbs]] into specialised subraces. These individuals call themselves *caligni*, after the ancestral home that they have never seen. As they were born to dark folk couples, their children are often also dark folk, typically [[Dark creeper|dark creepers]]. Calignis age at roughly the same rate as [[Half-elf|half-elves]].


## Society

> The birth of a caligni is celebrated by many dark folk, but usually annoys the powers that be in dark folk society (whether owbs or dark stalkers). Because of this, calignis who do not leave their birthplaces tend to suffer an unfortunate accident before adulthood. Calignis who foresee this seek homes elsewhere in the Darklands or in shadowy [[Nidal]], the only surface nation whose environment is friendly to the naturally light-sensitive calignis, where they can integrate easily into the darkness-worshipping society.
> [[New Calignos]], the southwestern district of the Nidalese capital [[Pangolais]], is extensively inhabited by calignis who have put in considerable effort to replicate Calignos from what calignis scholars know about Azlanti cities. It is doubtful that the architecture and traditions of New Calignos are authentic to Azlant, but they have regardless become deeply ingrained into the calignis who grow up there.
> Since calignis do not breed true, they usually prefer to adopt abandoned caligni children or steal them from their families. They revere Calignos, and consider themselves separate and distinct from the dark folk. The [[Shadow Caverns]] in Nidal, which connect to [[Nar-Voth]], are home to a thriving market of caligni infants either given up by or stolen from the dark folk, to be bought and adopted by Nidalese calignis. The children gain families, underground dark folk give up a potential source of trouble, and brokers turn a profit.


### Religion

> In addition to the dark folk's history of worship detailed above, some of the race worship [[Norgorber]] or [[Sivanah]]. Those whose homes lie below the surface-world nation of Nidal might follow that nation's official deity, [[Zon-Kuthon]]. Worship of [[Nocticula]], [[Pharasma]], and even [[Desna]] is not unheard of among those less malign caligni.


### Language

> All dark folk share a [[Darklands languagesCaligni|common language]] also called Caligni.


## On Golarion

> Dark folk live primarily in the caverns of [[Nar-Voth]], including the city of [[Sverspume]], famed for its [[Slavery|slave]] market, and the [[Duergar|duergar]] metropolis of [[Hagegraf]]. Although rarer in the deeper caverns of [[Sekamina]], a small section of the [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] city of [[Dwimovel]] is inhabited by dark folk, while others dwell in the [[Drow|drow]] city of [[Zirnakaynin]]. Even in the [[Orv|Vaults of Orv]], the dark folk are not unknown, as they inhabit the [[Land of Black Blood]]. Nearer to the surface, a sizeable population exists in the [[Shadow Caverns]] beneath [[Nidal|Nidals]] [[Uskwood]], in the abandoned [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[Zolurket Mines]] in [[Katapesh|Katapeshs]] [[Barrier Wall]] mountains, and below the island of [[Antler Rock]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]].


### In Tian Xia

> Although less common than in the [[Inner Sea region]], dark folk are also present in the caverns below the continent of [[Tian Xia]], especially in the underground community known as [[Deepmarket]] below the sprawling metropolis of [[Goka]].


> **Caligni** and **dark folk** were distinct but related creatures in [[Pathfinder First Edition]]. In [[Pathfinder Second Edition]], "dark folk" is instead a synonymous moniker for calignis that calignis find distasteful.
