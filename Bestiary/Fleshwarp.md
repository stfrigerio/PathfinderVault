*This article is about the unique [[Humanoid|humanoid]] fleshwarps. For specific non-humanoid types of fleshwarp, see the navbox below.*
> **Fleshwarp** is an umbrella term referring to people and creatures whose forms were created or greatly transformed by [[Magic|magic]], [[Alchemy|alchemy]], or [[Technology|technology]].



## Appearance

> Fleshwarps come in countless variations. [[Drow]] [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]] transforms victims into predictable, non-[[Humanoid|humanoid]] forms, depending on the species of the subject. For example, every drow becomes a [[Drider|drider]], which is the most common result of this process.
> Humanoid fleshwarps all look different, with the only common point being a mismatched appearance. They can measure from 5 to 7 feet tall and weigh from 100 pounds to more than 300 pounds, and usually have two arms and legs each. Otherwise, even fleshwarps that are siblings or transformed in the same way might look very different.


## Adventurers

> Fleshwarps often live on the margins of society. Effective self-defence skills lead many fleshwarps to become [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]], [[Fighter|fighters]], [[Rogue|rogues]], or [[PathfinderWiki/Ranger|rangers]]. [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Champion|Champions]] and [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] are frequent chosen paths among fleshwarps who seek to defend and better the lot of others of their type.


## Ecology

> Fleshwarps are divided into two categories: those created as a fleshwarp and those transformed into one. The former usually have a difficult upbringing and are likely to accept their own forms; the latter tend to hide themselves and be adept at hiding in their species' society.
> Drow fleshwarpers use deliberately painful, horrific procedures to transform their victims. Some are lucky enough to escape or survive a faulty process, allowing them to keep some of their humanoid features. These fleshwarps tend to be afraid of the dark and underground.
> Cults of [[Evil|evil]] [[Deity|deities]] of [[Transmutation|transmutation]] like [[Haagenti]] or [[Yamasoth]] sometimes transform victims in their vile rites. Only the transformation itself matters; the victim is usually released afterward, sometimes to instil terror among the populace but more often out of indifference.
> [[Fleshforge|Fleshforges]] in [[Nex]] also create fleshwarps, out of a purely academic interest to push magic to its limits. Many such fleshwarps willingly chose the transformation, and tend to have a more uniform appearance than other fleshwarps, since many of the transformation processes are replicable.
> Fleshwarps sometimes originate from the [[Laboratory|laboratories]] of [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] [[Science|scientists]], who usually cast them out or force them to do menial work. A few instead take on their creations as students, teaching them alchemical and scientific knowledge to the detriment of social skills.
> Some fleshwarps are transformed by an environmental accident or catastrophe, most often in the [[Mana Wastes]], where they have carved out a few settlements.
> During the [[Age of Legend]], many [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] [[Wizard|wizards]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemists]] were fleshwarpers who regularly used sigils to imbue magic to flesh and created many creatures from scratch. For many years, this knowledge was believed to be lost, only remaining in the form of [[Sinspawn|sinspawn]] and [[Fleshdreg|fleshdregs]], before the re-emergence of [[New Thassilon]] and the recent discoveries in Thassilonian ruins. Since then, fleshwarping [[Sin magic|sin magic]] has seen a revival.
> In [[Numeria]], the desperate or foolish often drink foul, eldritch fluids that turn them into fleshwarps. They tend to be more hopeful about finding a way to reverse the change, perhaps by drinking more fluids or forcing others to do so, even though this process usually transforms them further or kills them.


## Habitat

> Since fleshwarps are so few in number, they usually live alone, in small family groups, or at the fringes of community, where they follow jobs that do not require contact with many people. Some work in industries where their hardiness is a boon and their uncanny appearance does not matter. Settlements that consist fully of fleshwarps only exist in the Mana Wastes.


## Society

> Fleshwarps are quick to learn and value endurance, and usually share stories when encountering fellow fleshwarps. A fleshwarp's origin is usually a painful and horrifying process and only discussed among close friends or loved ones.
> Since fleshwarps have little to gain from society and need to be adaptable just to survive, they rarely work for society in turn and are seldom [[Law|lawful]]. Despite being stereotyped as monsters, they are no more or less [[Evil|evil]] than the average person, and tend toward [[Neutral|neutrality]]. Their neighbours might come to accept a fleshwarp and call out outsiders who make a big deal out of the 'monster', though strange events can quickly change people's feelings and force a fleshwarp to run away from their home to flee a misguided mob.
> Fleshwarps are usually non-religious (viewing faith as impractical or considering themselves abandoned by the [[Deity|gods]]) or exceptionally devout. Evil ones most often worship [[Lamashtu]]; others often turn to [[Arazni]], [[Calistria]], [[Desna]], or [[Gozreh]].
> The [[Oenopion Fleshforges]] is a guild based in [[Oenopion]] consisting of many of the most talented Nexian fleshforgers. They focus on creating fleshwarp soldiers for the state, who are often highly regarded for their skills.
