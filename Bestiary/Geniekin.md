> [[Genie|Genies]] and other [[Elemental|elemental]] creatures are able to breed with mortals, giving rise to the races collectively known as **geniekin** (sometimes, but more rarely, spelt as **genie kin** or **genie-kin**). [[Ifrit|Ifrits]] are the result of unions with fire creatures such as [[Efreeti|efreet]], [[Oread|oreads]] with earth creatures such as [[Shaitan|shaitan]], [[Sylph|sylphs]] with air creatures such as [[Djinni|djinn]], [[Undine|undines]] with water creatures such as [[Marid|marids]], and [[Suli|suli]] with [[Janni|jann]]. Though usually [[Half-human|half-human]]â€”from a human and genie parentâ€”geniekin may be born from other combinations of [[Humanoid|humanoids]] and elemental beings.


## History

> The earliest known geniekin were not descended from genies at all, but from [[Ancient Osirion|Ancient Osirian]] [[Human|humans]] who performed [[Magic|magical]] rituals to infuse themselves with [[Element|raw elemental essence]], giving rise to the ifrit, oread, sylph, and undine races; these geniekin married back into human families, giving rise to [[Bloodline|elemental bloodlines]] of [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]].
> With the rise of [[Kelesh]] and its genie-binders, many [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshites]] engaged in liaisons with [[Magic/Conjuration|summoned]] genies, bringing many half-blooded hybrids into the world. These "half-genies" were looked down upon in [[Qadira]] for being the bastard children of captives, and many fled to [[Osirion]] to escape persecution. Here they intermarried with [[Garundi human ethnicity|Garundi]] with elemental bloodlines, bringing about a new generation of geniekin. Following the fall of Keleshite power in modern Osirion, these geniekin are respected as a symbol of strength through the blending of cultures.


## On Golarion

> Geniekin (particularly sulis) are most commonly found today on the continent of [[Casmaron]].


> [[Paizo]] published a major work about geniekin called *[[Blood of the Elements]]*.
