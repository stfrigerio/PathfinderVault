> A **protean lord** is the most powerful type of [[Protean|protean]], possessing powers on the level of those of a [[Demon lord|demon lord]]. Most protean lords shift shapes wildly and frequently, so none know their true form. They spend their time reshaping and destroying vast realms within the [[Maelstrom]], watching the gods, and furthering the downfall of the powers of Law.


## Known protean lords

[[Ssila'meshnik|Ssilameshnik]], the Colorless Lord
Appearing as an albino [[Keketar|keketar]] protean with an intertwined trio of crowns, Ssila'meshnik is prone to appearing without warning in the court of [[Pharasma]] to arbitrate certain cases.
[[Il'surrish|Ilsurrish]] the Wanderer
This insubstantial protean lord often appears in the form of a cloud of partially coalescent light. If Il'surrish needs a corporeal body, it can fashion one from the [[Maelstrom]] or possess a nearby creature, causing them to glow with cerulean light.
[[Narriseminek]] the Crownless, The Maker of Kings
Narriseminek usually appears as a protean with a scar or burn mark on his head. He typically appears when a protean is ascending to a higher caste, or when a [[Keketar|keketar]] is about to receive a philosophy-changing vision.
