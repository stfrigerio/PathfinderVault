> **Animals** are living creatures of an intelligence lower than that of any person or other [[Humanoid|humanoid]]. Unlike [[Beast|beasts]], they are incapable of natural speech. There are many different types of animals, including mammals, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]], reptiles, amphibians, and [[Fish|fish]]. There also still exist prehistoric creatures classified as megafauna, such as [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dinosaur|dinosaurs]] or [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]].

> Whether through intense training, [[Magic|magic]], [[Spirit|spiritual]] possession or influence, or other supernatural abilities, intelligent creatures can often take an animal as a companion. 
> In most cases, these animals are trained to perform simple commands or serve as mounts. Among magic users, these animals might also grant their masters certain powers or abilities.


## Intelligent animals

*See also: [[Awaken]]*
> **Awakened** animalsâ€”those granted intelligence whether by [[Spell|spell]] or other forceâ€”have an intelligence that other animals lack, with some rivaling highly intelligent [[Humanoid|humanoids]]. Such animals often take on a personality derived from its natural tendencies; large herd animals prone to stampeding, for instance, act as raging [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]], while stealthy cats behave like [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]] or [[Rogue|rogues]].
