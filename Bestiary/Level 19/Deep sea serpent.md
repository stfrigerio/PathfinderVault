> **Deep sea serpents** are bigger cousins of common [[Sea serpent|sea serpents]] dwelling in the deepest ocean trenches.


## Appearance

> A deep sea serpent has bright, bulging eyes and rounded jaws filled with long, jagged teeth. A typical deep sea serpent measures 50 feet long and weighs 35,000 pounds.


## Ecology

> Deep sea serpents are naturally elusive and rarely leave their deep habitats to come to the surface, sometimes for unclear reasons and other times to hunt for [[Ship|ships]] and eat sailors. It is thought that in the most remote underwater habitats, there exist deep sea serpents with supernatural luminous lures, the ability to unleash electricity, or remarkable intelligence, but such claims are hard to verify.
