> **Tzitzimitls** are immense skeletal manifestations of death that appear on doomed [[Planet|worlds]] to herald events of great suffering. They were created by [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|liches]] of the [[Planet|planet]] [[Eox]] long ago to bring destruction upon living worlds.



## Appearance

> Tzitzimitls resemble gigantic [[Humanoid|humanoid]] [[Skeleton|skeletons]] about 50 feet tall and weigh thousands of pounds. They are constantly surrounded by crackling purple lightning and strange, otherworldly gases.


## Ecology

> Tzitzimitls only arrive upon worlds on the eve of dark times, but it is unknown whether they cause or merely presage these events. On some worlds, they were defeated by heroes and sealed within ancient, forgotten tombs. According to some cultures, tzitzimitls consume entire [[Star|stars]] to shut down worlds and prepare for the end times.


## Abilites

> They can release fiery beams of force from their eyes that cause great devastation, and can summon [[Magic|magical]] darkness that freezes anything caught within.


## On Golarion

> The Shade of Belimarius, which resembles the [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Belimarius]] and represents the upcoming doom of [[Xin-Edasseril]] if it cannot be freed from [[Time|time]]-locked [[Crystilan]], hides within the Eye of Jealousy.
