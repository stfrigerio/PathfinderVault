> **Gallus**, or **warmonger demons**, are the warmongers of the [[Abyss]].



## Appearance

> A gallu has a horned, hairless, [[Wolf|wolf]]-like head, [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bat]] wings, pale flesh, hooves, and [[Lion|lion]]-like tails. They stand eight feet tall and weigh 450 pounds. Gallus can also assume a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] form when seeking to instigate war among those with whom they interact.


## Ecology

> Gallus arise from the [[Soul|souls]] of people who, in life, fomented conflict for the purpose of profit or sadistic pleasure. They are difficult to [[Summon|summon]], and are usually only found on the [[Material Plane]] after travelling there via a [[Portal|portal]].


## Society

> Although they often instigate conflict for its own sake while on the Abyss, gallus are crafty and capable of resisting this natural destructive urge on the Material Plane. They prefer to disguise themselves and spend decades building influence until they reach a position with enough power to incite politicians into waging war. Once both sides have suffered enough, only then will the gallu reveal itself to torment the survivors before moving on.


## On Golarion

> In the [[Worldwound]], many gallus serve as high-ranking officers in [[Demon|demonic]] armies, each controlling a few [[Marilith|marilith]] generals and reporting to the Worldwound's leaders like [[Areelu Vorlesh]] or [[Khorramzadeh]]. A rare few gallus, most often servants of [[Baphomet]], infiltrate the Worldwound's enemies and 'advise' them into launching ill-considered attacks against the demons, and sometimes feed their erstwhile allies legitimate intelligence on the demons, in the hope of encouraging their violent urges.
