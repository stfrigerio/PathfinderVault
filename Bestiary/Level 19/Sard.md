*This article covers the species of [[Tane]]. For the [[Gemstone|gemstone]], see Sard (gemstone).*
> **Sards** are a species of [[Tane]] transformed by the [[Eldest]] from ancient elm, oak, or pine trees into living [[Siege engine|siege engines]] that crush cities under their branches.



## Appearance

> A sard resembles an immense leafless tree with the innate ability to [[Magic|magically]] disguise itself as a mundane tree. Despite their ungainly appearance, sards are surprisingly swift and agile when crawling on their [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spider]]-like roots like a massive arachnid. Their sap is a strange red lightning, and they have a number of potent electrical attacks that manifest with the colored energy.


## History

> The original great sard, also called "**the Witch-tree**" and "**Storm of Insanities**", was a creation of the [[Green Mother]], who combined the rage of sky and earth, before being adopted by other Eldest. It still stands dormant at its birth place, the Sardscar at the edge of the Hanging Bower in the [[First World]], ready to stride out when its mistress demands.


## Ecology

> Sards are nearly as intelligent as the average human, but they rarely show it. Their original purpose was to serve as living siege weapons, and when left to their own devices sards will often seek out settlements to destroy.
