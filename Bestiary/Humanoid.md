> **Humanoid** is a broad classification, or type, of creatures that reasonably closely resemble [[Human|humans]]: they usually have two arms, two legs, and a single head. In size, they vary from small [[Halfling|halflings]] to the size of [[Giant|giants]]. Humanoids tend to lack supernatural and extraordinary abilities. Humanoid [[Languages of Golarion|languages]] are often rich and their societies are well-developed.
