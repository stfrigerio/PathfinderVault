> Shoonies are small, bipedal [[Humanoid|humanoids]] who resemble brachycephalic [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|dogs]]. They are primarily found on the [[Isle of Kortos]] in small farming communities. Shoonies are unwaveringly optimistic and always see the best in others, seeking redemption and forgiveness before violence.



## Appearance

> Typically around 3' 6" tall and weighing 100 pounds, shoonies are squat and furry with flattened canine faces and wet, black noses. Their fur is most commonly fawn or black in color, though patterns are not uncommon, and even the fittest shoony has a pudgy appearance due to their loose skin. Shoonies have short, curly tails that sometimes wag involuntarily when they are particularly overwhelmed with happiness or excitement. Similar to dogs, shoonies  pant to cool off, and a shoony with a lolling tongue is a common sight on a warm day. Sexual dimorphism is practically non-existent, and as they age, both sexes develop gray facial fur, wrinkly skin, and frail joints.


## Adventurers

> Few shoonies willingly choose to leave their homeland and friends in favor of facing the unknown, and the circumstances that lead a shoony to adventure are often dramatic and life-altering, if not tragic. That said, some shoonies do travel to search for riches to bring back to their home or to avenge their kinfolk, and shoony [[Adventurer|adventurers]] who show courage or ingenuity are sure to earn a place in the legends of their people. Many shoony adventurers are [[Fighter|fighters]] who hone their skills to become stalwart defenders of their friends. Some shoonies pursue theology and become [[Cleric|clerics]] or [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Champion|champions]], while others develop their foraging and hunting skills as talented [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Ranger|rangers]].


## Culture

> Shoonies typically live in small farming communities as a way reducing environmental impact and place significant value in improving the ecosystems around them. To the shoony people, nothing is more important than the community around them and the environment that supports them. Pacifism, empathy, loyalty, and generosity are values that are pervasive within shoony society.
> A shoony reaches maturity between the ages of eight to ten years old, and it is rare to find even a village elder over the age of 50. Despite the brevity of their lifespans, shoonies maintain a rosy outlook on life, even in the toughest of times. Shoonies rely on close ties with loved ones, the beauty of the natural world, and the inherent rewards of hard work to lift their spirits in the face of adversity.


### Religion

> Shoony mythology claims that [[Aroden]] created their kind to be his companions shortly after he raised the Isle of Kortos from the sea. As a result, shoonies primarily worshiped Aroden until his death. Since then, many shoonies have adopted [[Erastil]] as their patron [[Deity|deity]] due to the overlap between his edicts on family, community, and responsibility to the natural world and typical shoony values. For the rare warriors among the shoony people, [[Iomedae]] is worshiped as a paragon of diligence and integrity.
