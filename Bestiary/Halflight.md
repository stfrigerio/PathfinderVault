 Halflight is second left.
> The [[Apocalypse horse|apocalypse horse]] **Halflight** is the mount of the [[Trelmarixian|Trelmarixian the Horseman of Famine]]. The advanced [[Nightmare|nightmares]] glossy ebon skin stretches tight over its bones and its form resembles a [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Horse|horse]] in prolonged starvation. Its eyes glow with the eerie radiance of [[Abaddon|Abaddons]] eclipsed sky. Trelmarixian does not ride his steed so much as inhabits it, the nightmare vomiting the Horseman out from its mouth, nose, and eyes once they arrive at their destination.
