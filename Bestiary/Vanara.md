> **Vanaras** are a race of intelligent, simian [[Humanoid|humanoids]] who dwell in the jungles and forests of [[Casmaron]]. They have their own [[Language|language]] called [[Vanaran]].



## Appearance

> Vanaras are normally slightly shorter than the average [[Human|human]]. They are covered in a thin coat of short fur that can be a variety of colours: from ivory to light browns, chestnuts, and even gold. Despite being covered in fur, vanaras still grow lengthy hair on their head and both male and female vanaras take considerable pride in wearing elaborate hairstyles to any social function. All vanaras have long prehensile tails and their feet are almost as dexterous and capable of fine manipulation as their hands are. Vanaras are naturally very dexterous and also have a deep-seated natural wisdom.


## Society

> Vanaras, on the whole, are a boundlessly curious people who also seem to have a natural penchant for pranks which, unfortunately, means they often struggle to ingratiate themselves with people of other races. Vanaras normally dwell in treetop villages with the individual buildings connected by rope bridges and ladders. These communities are normally led by some sort of holy person, normally either a [[Cleric|cleric]], [[Monk|monk]], or [[Oracle|oracle]] of some sort.


## On Golarion

> Vanaras are a comparatively common sight in the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]] and are even incorporated into the country's caste system. Many vanaras have flocked to the fortresses and cities (such as [[Dhalanagar]]) of the [[Open Bridge]] region of Vudra, desperate to reclaim their homelands. Their former island homes became landlocked in [[4606 AR]] when the [[Obari Ocean]] receded exposing a new land bridge that was tragically infested with hordes of ravaging [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aberration|aberrations]]. Vanaras are numerous in the vast [[Crying Jungle]] region of Vudra, one of the densest, most verdant jungles in the entirety of Casmaron. Vanaras are also the second largest demographic in [[Radripal|Radripal the City of Arches]].
> On the continent of [[Tian Xia]] vanara can be found living within the depths of the deadly [[Valashmai Jungle]] in the continent's southern reaches. These vanara are quite different from their Vudran cousins as life within the lethal jungle has caused most of the tribes of vanara to resort to vicious savagery.
