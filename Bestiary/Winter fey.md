> **Winter fey** are [[Evil|evil]] [[Fey|fey]] infused with the primal cold of winter, which grants them thicker natural armor, fast natural healing, improved strength and resiliency, and icy claws. They inhabit the coldest areas in the [[First World]], and rarely come to warmer lands unless ordered by a liege or if they have a particular purpose.
> Winter fey feel no empathy and delight in causing pain, often spending months crafting an evil plan for no more than idle, amusing cruelty; this is also how they gain respect among their kind. Winter fey usually carry a trophy harvested from their newest victim until they claim another.
