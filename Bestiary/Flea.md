> **Fleas** are blood-drinking insects that can be encountered both as diminutive [[Vermin|vermin]] and as giant, powerful creatures.



## Ecology

> Fleas live as parasites on larger [[Animal|animals]], drinking their blood. They occasionally gather in large roving swarms, which drain the blood from any creature that crosses their path. Fleas can transmit [[Diseases of Golarion|disease]] to other creatures.


## Variants

> **Giant fleas** are immense variants of the common insect. They typically feed on and are found alongside large megafauna, such as [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dinosaur|dinosaurs]] and [[Mammoth|mammoths]].


## In society

> Fleas are often used as pets, beasts of burden, or minions by creatures, such as [[Goblin|goblins]] and [[Gremlin|gremlins]], that live in conditions of intense filth or overpopulation. Such creatures are unfazed by the appearance of and diseases transmitted by fleas. [[Ratfolk]] are known to use tamed giant fleas as mounts. Urban [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]], particularly ones who use magic based on blights or disease, are also known to [[Summon|summon]] swarms of fleas.
