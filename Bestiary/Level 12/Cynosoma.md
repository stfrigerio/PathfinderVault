> **Cynosomas**, also known as **moth angels** or **daughters of Desna**, are a race of [[Celestial|celestials]] from the [[Demiplane|demiplane]] of [[Cynosure]].


## Appearance

> A cynosoma appears as a [[Moth|moth]]-winged woman whose features are somewhat masked by shimmering dust. She stands six feet tall and weighs about 120Â pounds.


## Ecology

> Shy and retiring, cynosomas prefer the secluded corners of Cynosure. Cynosomas often wander the vastness of the [[Material Plane]] with [[Desna|Desnas]] blessing: she encourages her children to choose their own path, even when it leads away from herÂ service. They rarely seek battle, but are willing to fight especially if there are innocents to protect or enemies of their faith. Cynosomas are protectors of sleepers and never willingly allow sleeping creatures, no matter whom, to be harmed.
