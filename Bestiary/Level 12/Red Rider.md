> The **Red Rider** is one of [[Baba Yaga's Riders|Baba Yagas Riders]], the heralds who proceed the [[Baba Yaga|Witch Queen]] to [[Irrisen]] so they they may judge the inhabitants of that snowy realm. The Red Rider performs his duty in the daylight of the afternoon, leaving the morning daylight hours and the night to his companions, the [[White Rider|White]] and the [[Black Rider]], respectively. Baba Yaga refers to this rider, mounted on a horse of reddish-gold, as 'My Red Sun',  while the [[Jadwiga]] call him just 'Sun'.
