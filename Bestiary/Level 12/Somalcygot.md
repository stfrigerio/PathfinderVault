> **Somalcygots** are large predatory flat-worms resident on [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Moon Golarion|moon]].



## Appearance

> A somalcygot is a flatworm with multiple eyes and a vertical mouth filled with teeth and surrounded by mandibles. Four long, twitching antennae stretch from its face, and four tentacles emerge from its body. The average somalcygot is 16 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds.


## Ecology

> Somalcygots can digest most organic matter. Due to the desolation of their habitat, somalcygot meals are rare. In order to conserve energy, they spend most of their time burrowing in circles in a trance-like state; when a prey item arrives, somalcygots throw themselves at them, fighting with a relentless frenzy until the prey escapes or dies.


## Habitat

> Each somalcygot claims a mile-radius of ground on the moon as its hunting ground. Somalcygots are territorial creatures, and in order to avoid needless conflict with others, they seldom pursue prey beyond their territory and only enter another's territory to mate.


## On Golarion

> 27 somalcygots are found in the ruins of [[Bilith-Vel]], serving as 'territorial governors' for the [[Lunar dragon|lunar dragon]] Rezallian, who views itself as the city's [[Deity|god]]. Each somalcygot watches over several city blocks and spits acid at intruders, giving Bilith-Vel its signature sickly sweet smell.
