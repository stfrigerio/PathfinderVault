> **Black jinn**, also known as **black ghosts** or **nisnases**, are a [[Curses of Golarion|cursed]] tribe of [[Genie|genies]] nearly forgotten even by their own kin. They are considered bearers of ill will and destruction upon mortals and their own kind alike.



## Appearance

> A black jinni looks like a dark, muscular, [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]], and unnaturally proportioned [[Humanoid|humanoid]] obscured by a perpetual cloud of desert-smelling dust.


## Habitat and society

> Black jinn roam distant wastes of the [[Material Plane]] and [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]] alike, though most hide for ages in lost cities and far-flung strongholds. They destroy any living creatures who approach such sites, which only enhances these locations' reputations as cursed places of great wealth. The few black jinn who wander are drawn to civilization, even challenging mortals to fatal battles of wits or cursing communities into slow decline.
> Their violent behavior and isolation makes study of black jinn difficult, even by other genies. One theory holds that genies can be corrupted into black jinn through forbidden [[Magic|magic]], sacred sites, or provoked misfortune, but such instances are rare and mostly undocumented.


## On Golarion

> Few encounter black jinn on [[Golarion]], and even fewer survive such an event. Black jinn terrorize deserts with sudden and violent electrical sandstorms, and their victims either disappear or are killed, leaving only charred or glass-glazed corpses in their wake.
> The [[Isle of Black Palms]] near [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]] is thought to host a black jinn, as a strange tower amid its ruins still appears to be inhabited. All who approach the island are driven off by unnatural misfortunes, and none who reach it are heard from again.
