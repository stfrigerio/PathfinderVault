> **Exscinder** [[Archon|archons]] serve as the censors of [[Heaven]]. They search the [[Plane|planes]] for texts containing information too [[Evil|evil]] or dangerous to be allowed to exist. Exscinders prefer to focus on protecting [[Mortal|mortalkind]] as a whole, rather than saving individuals from corruption.


## Appearance

> An exscinder appears as a mouthless [[Humanoid|humanoid]] figure with flaming wings that carries a burning [[Sword|sword]] and can adjust its size.


## Abilities

> An exscinder can attempt to [[Magic|magically]] steal or modify any text within 100 feet. A stolen text [[Teleport|teleports]] directly into the exscinder's hand, while a modified text is permanently revised according to its wishes.
