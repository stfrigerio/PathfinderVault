> A **vouivre** is a two-headed, reptilian aquatic creature. While its head and body resemble an elongated, winged green [[Wyvern|wyvern]], its tail resembles the upper body of a beautiful dark-haired [[Humanoid|humanoid]] woman. They spend their time bathing in pools and slow-moving rivers, preferring to prey on humanoid males and other people that come too near.


## Appearance

> A vouivre is 12 feet long from end to end and weighs 500 pounds. Vouivres can breathe fire like a [[Dragon|dragon]], and rattle their scales to produce unnerving [[Magic|magical]] sonic effects.


## Habitat and ecology

> Vouivres reproduce asexually. After death, a vouivre's dragon head expels a [[Ruby|ruby]] that serves as an egg. After growing for several weeks, a juvenile vouivre hatches and spends seven years maturing and hunting [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|waterfowl]] and [[Fish|fish]]. A vouivre can live for 200 years, and needs to feed every two months.
> Vouivres draw [[Serpent|serpents]] of all kinds to them, and occasionally collaborate with [[Evil|evil]] [[Fey|fey]], but otherwise dwell apart from other creatures. Vouivres have a dragon's love of [[Gemstone|gemstones]] and treasure, although they sometimes use their hoards to lure unwary travelers.
