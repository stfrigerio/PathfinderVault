> A **calikang** is a large, blue, six-armed [[Monstrous humanoid|monstrous humanoid]] that can survive in suspended animation, typically tasked to guard treasure vaults, harems, and castles.



## Appearance

> Calikangs generally stand about 14 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds. They can live for up to 200 years, but frequently survive longer due to their suspended animation ability. Calikang skin typically has a blue hue.


## History

> According to legend, when the god [[Vineshvakhi]], a deity of guardians and protector of celestial treasures and harems and one of the thousand deities of [[Vudra]], failed to prevent an [[Asura|asura]] raid, he cut off the six fingers of his hand and threw them down to the earth. The calikangs crawled from the devastated craters where these fingers fell.
> Calikangs feel an innate sense of shame about Vineshvakhi's failing, and expect members of their species to atone for it by offering its service as guardian. Although this service is generally expected to last for a century, many unscrupulous characters manipulate the calikang's unique perspective into securing much longer periods of servitude.


## Habitat and ecology

> Calikangs are very rare, since so many of their members have been taken as guards. Calikang tribes dwell in temperate and tropical Vudrani foothills, or elsewhere in inhospitable jungles, swamps, or deserts.
> Most notable in the [[Inner Sea region]] are the coastal tribes of freed calikangs that once served the mage [[Nex]], but fled into the [[Mana Wastes]] when Nex disappeared. Over the centuries, they have come to see the Wastes as a scar upon reality and now seek to "repair" the ravaged land by periodically traveling out of the desert and into neighboring lands to harvest magic, then releasing the undamaged energy into the Mana Wastes. They hope that eventually the magic will "refill" the emptied container of magic that is the modern Mana Wastes. Although most believe this effort to be futile, the calikangs persist in their task.
> Calikangs grow from infancy to adulthood over a period of a week, in which they undergo nightmares and painful moltings that only half of infants survive. The birth of a calikang child is an occasion of great celebration and vigilance by the entire tribe, which culminates in a great feast of the new member's molted skin and bones. The creatures can survive for 200 years, or much longer through suspended animation, although most young calikangs wander off to seek roles as guardians.
> Calikangs can absorb magical energy for healing and blast opponents with energy rays from their eyes and mouth. During their periods of suspended animation, they are conscious and aware of the passage of time, but do not age or need to breathe or eat.
