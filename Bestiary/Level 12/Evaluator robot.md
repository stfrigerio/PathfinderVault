> **Evaluator robots** are [[Robot|robots]] designed by the [[Human|humans]] of [[Androffa]] to secretly plan direct contact with assess alien cultures, usually pre-[[Space travel|spaceflight]] ones, by asking questions, comparing the answers to profiles of existing cultures, and wiping their memories from the subjects.


## Design

> Most evaluator robots are fashioned into the forms of [[Angel|angels]] slightly taller than the [[Humanoid|humanoids]] they were tasked to interact with so as to appear majestic and pleasing to them. Made from sophisticated lightweight materials, they weigh under 400 pounds.
> Evaluator robots tested their own designs through trial and error by paying close attention to religions: they discovered that the residents of many worlds held respect for angels, so Androffan engineers built the majority of evaluator robots in this form.


## On Golarion

> Nearly every evaluator robot in the [[Inner Sea region]] has been found in [[Silver Mount]]. One of them, designed to resemble a [[Cornugon|cornugon]], was destroyed by a [[Kellid]] tribe in the [[Sellen Hills]], and another reportedly resembling a six-armed, three-faced, bronze-skinned woman was spotted briefly by [[Griffon|griffon]] riders at [[Castle Urion]] before it headed south into the [[River Kingdoms]].
