> **Basilosauruses** are a species of primeval [[Whale|whale]].



## Appearance

> A basilosaurus resembles a greatly elongated whale measuring 60 feet, but with long, toothed [[Alligator|alligator]]-like jaws. Inexperienced observers often confuse a basilosaurus with a [[Sea serpent|sea serpent]] or [[Water orm|water orm]].


## Ecology

> Basilosauruses locate prey with echolocation and vision, but sometimes mistake smaller [[Ship|ships]] for food. Basilosauruses are apex predators: a fully-grown one is only threatened by [[Magical beast|supernatural monsters]] like [[Kraken|krakens]], [[Thalassic behemoth|thalassic behemoths]], and the largest sea serpents.
