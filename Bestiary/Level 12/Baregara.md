> **Baregaras** are horned, crimson-furred, [[Gorilla|gorilla-like]] [[Outsider|outsiders]] crafted by the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Angazhan]] from the [[Soul|souls]] of especially cruel primates, particularly [[Charau-ka|charau-ka]], [[Girallon|girallons]], and [[Awaken|awakened]] [[Ape|apes]].



## Appearance

> Baregaras are 12 feet tall from their feet to their horns, even when walking stooped on their knuckles. They can weigh up to 1,500 pounds.


## Abilities

> Each baregara has a maw in its chest, where the heart of a [[Mortal|mortal]] gorilla would be. This maw can consume and transport souls, turning them into bright purple lights. The baregara then returns these souls to [[Ahvoth-Kor]], where the souls are built into new baregaras.


## Habitat and society

> While crafted by a demon lord, baregaras are not [[Demon|demons]]. Instead, they are a prototypical form of a demon, much like [[Bebilith|bebiliths]] or xacabras.
> Baregaras operate in small groups much like mortal apes, though as outsiders they share no other ecological or societal traits. These groups have complex, inscrutable hierarchies that revolve around trophies from their past kills, though such rivalries are ignored when working on their demon lord's orders or against a common enemy.


### On Golarion

> Soul-bearing baregaras are often mistaken for [[Will-o'-wisp|will-o-wisps]] as they swing through the canopies of the [[Mwangi Jungle]]. [[Quetz couatl|Quetz couatls]] and baregaras are mortal enemies who mercilessly hunt each other when they encounter one another on the [[Material Plane]].
> While baregaras submit to being [[Magic/Conjuration|summoned]] by mortal spellcasters, they always serve Angazhan above all others.


### On distant worlds

> Baregaras inhabit the [[Moonscar]] on [[Somal]], Golarion's [[Moon|moon]].
