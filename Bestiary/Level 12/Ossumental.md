> **Ossumentals** are [[Undead|unliving]] creatures found only in the [[Slave Trenches of Hakotep]] in central [[Osirion]], made up of the corpses of hundreds of [[Slavery|slaves]] used to create the site long ago.



## Appearance

> Standing sixteen feet tall, ossumentals are made of hundreds of [[Sun|sun-bleached]] [[Humanoid|humanoid]] skeletons assembled into a roughly humanoid form, with four arms ending in bone claws. Despite resembling, in shape, the [[Human|humans]] whose bones they comprise, the ossumentals are not mere giant [[Skeleton|skeletons]]: the human bones form the ossument in ways alien to their original use, with skulls serving as knees or shoulders, leg bones used to form fingers and other such aberrant constructions.


## Habitat & Ecology

> Ossumentals have only ever formed in the Slave Trenches of Hakotep, when the [[Elemental|elemental]] [[Spirit|spirits]] escape their imprisonment in the obelisks that line the trenches' walls and infuse the bones of the thousands of slaves that died millennia ago creating the trenches. They now serve as bound guardians and *de-facto* caretakers for the remote Slave Trenches, their presence making this already perilous place even more deadly. Some strange compulsion seems to drive the ossumentals to take care of their erstwhile prison, fighting a never-ending battle to clear the encroaching sand from the trenches. Ossumentals have only ever been seen in the Slave Trenches of Hakotep as only it has the unique combinations of slowly escaping elemental spirit and massed death necessary for their creation. As a result of their unusual animating force, ossumentals posses a powerful breath weapon that releases raw elemental energy which varies depending on the type of elemental that animates it. Ossumentals do not spend all their time in humanoid form and often appear as nothing more than a heap of desert-bleached bones right up until the moment they attack.


## Variants

> There are four known variants of ossumentals: **air ossumentals**, **earth ossumentals**, **fire ossumentals**, and **water ossumentals** each based on the variety of elemental spirit that animates it.
