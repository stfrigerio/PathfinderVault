> **Valkyries** are a race of [[Outsider|outsiders]] from the [[Maelstrom]] who scour the battlefields of the [[Material Plane]] looking for fallen warriors to transform into [[Einherji|einherjar]].



## Appearance

> Valkyries appear as strong and beautiful [[Human|human]], [[Dwarf|dwarven]], or [[Elf|elven]] women clad in a gleaming [[Gold|golden]] [[Nethys/Equipment/Armors/Breastplate|breastplate]] and carrying a shining [[Spear|spear]]. A human valkyrie is six feet tall and weighs close to 200 pounds.


## Ecology

> Valkyries are formed from [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] risen from the [[Soul|souls]] of the greatest of soldiers. With a glance, a valkyrie can distinguish between someone who lives to fight another day and someone who cannot survive, and can either aid the living in the fight or claim the soul of the slain and transform them into einherjar. Valkyries and einherjar are often found in the Maelstrom, aboard [[Ship|ships]] or island realms, wherever the call of battle and conflict rages.
> Valkyries serve a variety of [[Deities|deities]], most often [[Gorum]] and [[Calistria]]. They typically fight mounted on flying steeds such as [[Dragon horse|dragon horses]], [[Pegasus|pegasi]] or [[Sleipnir|sleipnirs]].


## Variants

> A [[Law|lawful]] variety of valkyries can be found in the Shatterhall in the [[Vault of the Onyx Citadel]], transformed from dwarven petitioners from [[Kraggodan]] who got lost and followed the Stone Roads instead of the [[River of Souls]] upon death.
