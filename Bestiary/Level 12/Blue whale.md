> **Blue whales** are among the largest aquatic [[Animal|animals]] on [[Golarion]], and are often hunted for their blubber, which is used to make oil. Also prized are their bones, which are used to make [[Weapon|weapons]] and [[Art|art]] objects using a type of carving called [[Scrimshaw|scrimshaw]]. Blue whales are filter-feeders, and subsist on millions of minuscule invertebrates known as krill. They are not typically aggressive towards [[Humanoid|humanoids]], as they do not see them or their ships are meals, but can be dangerous due to their sheer size and their ability to capsize ships with blows of their tails.


## In Golarion

> Blue whales are widespread, and can be found in every sea and ocean on Golarion. They are among the economically important animals hunted in the [[Shining Sea]], and sometimes pass east from it and enter into the adjoining [[Ivory Sea]].
