> An **id mutant** is a creature warped by [[Magic|magic]] amplifying a person's primal instincts in ways that transform that person's mind and body into a base, [[Animal|animalistic]] form.
> Id mutants can be created through a [[Curses of Golarion|bestial curse]] generated by [[Dream crystal|dream crystals]] that have been polluted by a [[Vespergaunt|vespergaunt]]'s wishcraft. After experiencing restless dreams, headaches, and a quickened temper from exposure to refined dream crystal [[Toxin|toxin]], victims who receive a sufficient dose of the toxin or experience a stressful triggering event might transform into an id mutant.
> Large doses of dream crystal toxin can also cause victims to rapidly increase in size when transforming.


## Restoration

> Some id mutations can be at least partially resisted by victims with especially strong wills.
> Most id mutations can be reversed within 10 days by sufficiently powerful [[Spell|spells]] capable of dispelling enchantments or breaking curses. After that point, only the most powerful magical forces, including resurrection magic, can reverse the curse.
