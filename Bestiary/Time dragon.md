> **Time dragons** are [[Immortal|immortal]], powerful [[Outer dragon|outer dragons]] who guard the [[Universe|universes]] natural [[Time|temporal]] order against interference.



## Appearance

> A time dragon has slender, spiny protrusions sweeping back from its face, a mix of seemingly new and ancient growths. Its scales are cracked and creaky.


## Habitat

> Time dragons can travel the vacuum of [[Space travel|space]] and lair in [[Star|stars]].


## Abilities

> Time dragons are such alien creatures that others are often confused in their presence. A great wyrm time dragon can temporarily stop time, and can also travel with companions to any point in time, but only three total times over its lifespan. Its breath, while typically electrical in nature, can also displace creatures exposed to it into a future point in time. They are immune to extreme cold.
> Time dragons speak at least [[Elven]] and [[Draconic]] in addition to [[Taldane]], and some also speak [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/celestial]], [[Dwarven]], [[Infernal]], and [[Sylvan]].


## On Golarion

> Time dragons visit [[Golarion]] only to prevent the most egregious abuses of time and [[Temporal energy|temporal energy]].


## In the Great Beyond

> Time dragons are one of the few sources of information about the mysterious [[Dimension of Time]]. They are also often at odds with the many forms of [[Shyka]], [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/fey|fey]] [[Deity|deity]] of time, although time dragons and Shyka still speak on occasion.
