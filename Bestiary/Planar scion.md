> **Planar scion** is a blanket term for [[Material Plane]] [[Humanoid|humanoids]] (of any species) infused with the essence of another [[Plane|plane]]. Most planar scions have a distant ancestor who hails from one such plane, with a minority being the result of planar energies, [[Magic|magic]], or [[Deity|divine]] intervention. The characteristic traits of a planar scion often go dormant after the first generation but can manifest again in future generations.


## Types

> Types of planar scion, and the planes they are tied to, include:

> - [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aasimar|Aasimars]] ([[Heaven]], [[Nirvana]] and [[Elysium]])

> - [[Duskwalker|Duskwalkers]] ([[Boneyard]])

> - [[Undine|Undines]] ([[Plane of Water]])
> Aphorites, duskwalkers and ganzis, who all share ties to [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Monitor|monitors]], are sometimes collectively called **urobians**. Planar scions from the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]] are also called [[Geniekin|geniekin]], since the vast majority of them are descended from [[Genie|genies]].
