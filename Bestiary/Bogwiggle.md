> **Bogwiggles**, termed **toadhounds** by some, are stunted and unintelligent creatures created as side-effects of the growth of the young of the priest-king of a [[Boggard|boggard]] tribe.



## Appearance

> Bogwiggles resemble monstrous tadpoles the size of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|dogs]], with bulbous bodies dominated by their large heads, clawed arms, and long tails. They share the coloration of the boggard tribe to which they belong, and like boggards, tend to lose their coloration as they age.


## Ecology

> Bogwiggles originate from the young of a boggard priest-king, whose tadpoles are fed a diet of [[Poison|poisonous]] blue dragonflies. Most of these young die, while some develop enhanced [[Magic|magical]] and mental abilities. Most survivors, however, are physically and mentally stunted by the toxins, never fully developing out of their tadpole stage and becoming little more intelligent than a dog. The resulting creatures, named bogwiggles, are used by their tribes as hunting [[Animal|animals]] and guards, and often severely mistreated. Although bogwiggles may live to be twenty years old, most reach only half that age due to mistreatment from their boggard masters and other dangers in the swamps they inhabit.


## Variants

> Bogwiggles come in at least four different variants:

> - Bogwiggle
> - **Croaking bogwiggle**
> - **Filthy bogwiggle**
> - **Poisonous bogwiggle**
