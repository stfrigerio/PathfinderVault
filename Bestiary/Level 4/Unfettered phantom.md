> **Unfettered phantoms** are the [[Soul|souls]] of the dead who became stuck in the [[Ethereal Plane]], unable to continue on their journey to [[Pharasma]]'s [[Boneyard]] due to a dominant emotion, which also drags them towards the [[Negative Energy Plane]] to become [[Undead|undead]]. An unfettered phantom desperately seeks to escape this fate by searching for a psychically attuned being to merge with. Such a merger creates a [[Spiritualist|spiritualist]], while the unfettered phantom becomes simply a [[Phantom|phantom]]; until then, it is a frantic, shifting, desperate creature of raw emotion and need.
