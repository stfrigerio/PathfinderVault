*See also: [[Tenebrous worm]]*
> **Gloomwings** are a species of purple [[Moth|moth]]-like [[Outsider|outsiders]] with [[Animal|animal]] intelligence and shifting black patterns on their wings that are native to the [[Shadow Plane]]. When on the [[Material Plane]], gloomwings lair in secluded, dark areas and are most active around dawn or dusk, when they seek living hosts for their eggs. When they hatch, their [[Tenebrous worm|tenebrous worm]] larvae will devour the host as their first meal. Each gloomwing can lay eggs in several hosts per day, and their young are much more dangerous than adult gloomwings are.
