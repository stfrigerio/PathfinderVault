![[Scarlet_Gargoyle_PFmini.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 The [[Scarlet Son]]: a [[Fiendish|fiendish]] gargoyle.

> Resembling stony statues of winged monsters, **gargoyles** are airborne menaces in both civilised regions and remote wildernesses. They often worship the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Xoveron]], whose titles include Lord of Gargoyles.



## Appearances

> Gargoyles resemble a stone statue of some hideous, malevolent [[Demon|demon]]. They can remain so unnaturally still that they can pass as statues, and it takes a perceptive eye to distinguish them from normal, inanimate statues. A gargoyle's appearance very slowly shifts over time to adapt to its surroundings, which allows it to match the local [[Architectural|architectural]] style. It even adapts in wilderness regions matching the surrounding stone. The Ashwing gargoyles of the [[Cinderlands]] have smooth, wind-worn bodies with rippling ashen and brick-coloured patterns, while gargoyles of the [[Uwaga Highlands]] are chalky and pale to better resemble the [[Chalk Cliffs]] they call home.


## Habitat and ecology

> Gargoyles can live anywhere there is open sky and a place to perch. Groups of gargoyles are called "wings", and they tend to dwell in more rugged wilderness areas. Lone gargoyles often prefer to hide in densely populated cities where their hunting can go unnoticed.
> Many gargoyles have obsessive behaviours like collecting items from their prey, and their collections can range from books or [[Weapon|weapons]] to grisly trophies. Some gargoyles are willing to ally with other creatures, but these alliances are fleeting at best; gargoyles prove treacherous and vengeful allies, showing terrible wrath at even the smallest imagined slight.
> In rural areas, gargoyles hunt much like any other primitive [[Humanoid|humanoid]] tribe. In civilized areas they tend to hunt on society's outcasts, beggars, drunks, and vagabonds at night, which helps conceal them from their victims.
> [[Elephant]]-sized [[Shantak|shantaks]], which are much more powerful than gargoyles, possess an irrational fear of them.


## Variants

> **Kapoacinths** are an unusual aquatic variety of gargoyle. These strange creatures retain a gargoyle's fearsome appearance, but instead of swooping through the night sky, kapoacinths glide through the depths of the seas, their wings useless for flight. Groups of kapoacinths are far more likely to gather in wings than their land-based cousins since they have no interest in solitary life. They also tend to dwell in coastal shallows rather than the dark depths of the open ocean. Though they are aquatic creatures, they can survive on land and enjoy shambling out of the water to attack isolated coastal communities.
