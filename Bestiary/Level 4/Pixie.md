>  Tiny [[humans]] with gossamer-thin [[Butterfly]] wings, **pixies** are what most folk imagine when they think of [[Fey]].



## Appearance

>  Pixies appear as two-foot-tall, somewhat whimsical-looking, humans with vividly coloured butterfly wings. They make up for their small stature by floating at eye level with any creature they converse with; talking quickly, they tend to get over excited very easily.


## Ecology

>  Pixies are creatures both tied to the natural world and beyond it; as fey, they are inherently tied to the mysterious [[First World]] and possess strange abilities. They are able to generate a [[magical]] dust that they can use to put their enemies to sleep, steal their memories, or even charm them into becoming a temporary friend. They also possess innate magical powers to [[confuse]] the senses, create minor [[illusions]], and generally befuddle the mind.


## Habitat

>  Pixies dwell in the most pristine of forests, mostly across [[Avistan]]. While forests are where they are most at home, the insatiable curiosity of pixies draws them to wander to many strange locales. While pixies normally dwell only in temperate forests, some can be found as far north as the [[Grungir Forest]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]].


## On Golarion

>  Pixies are common inhabitants of the deepest reaches of the Grungir Forest, particularly around [[Sojourner's Rest]] and [[Thornwall Castle]] where they serve as subjects of [[Mad Jan]], the so called 'Pixie King'. They are also known to dwell around the "unstuck" town of [[Uringen]] in the [[River Kingdoms]]. Whilst normally forest dwellers, pixies can even be found in the depths of the [[Darklands]] as part of the [[Court of Ether]] in the [[Endless Gulf]].
