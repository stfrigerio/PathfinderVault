> **Shaes** are inhabitants of the [[Shadow Plane]] composed of insubstantial shadows that resemble [[Humanoid|humanoids]]. Lacking distinct forms, they are known to wear masks and form-fitting clothing when dealing with members of other races, as those with more definite forms often find them difficult to focus on.
