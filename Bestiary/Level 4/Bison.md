Before the beginning of their next turn, they can then charge as a reaction triggered by an adjacent bison beginning its Rolling Thunder charge.

The combined charge deals an additional 3d6 (3d6) bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area, and a creature that fails the Reflex saving throw is also knocked [[prone|prone]]."

> **Bison** are large, horned, wild herd animals similar to the more frequently domesticated [[Aurochs|aurochs]].



## Appearance

> Bison are distinguished by a hump at their shoulders; small, upward-facing horns; and a shaggy, furry coat. A bison can be up to 7 feet tall at its hump and 12 feet long, and weighs an average of 2,200 pounds.


## Abilities

> Like other large herd animals, several bison can stampede together as a group.


## Ecology

> Bison most often travel in herds of up to 30. They are generally more aggressive than aurochs, and male bison are known to kill rivals within a herd during mating seasons.


### On Golarion

> A bison's fur coat makes it more suitable for colder climates than aurochs, and they are known to herd in places like the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], where local [[Kellid|Kellids]] often hunt them or even trigger stampedes against intruders; and in [[Irrisen|Irrisens]] [[Thronehold]], where stilyagi imitate Kellid barbarians and hunt bison. Further south bison can also be found in the [[Algid Wastes]] of [[Smokespur]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]; the [[Whistling Plains]] of [[Taldor]], where herds number in the tens of thousands. They also roam throughout the northern reaches of [[Numeria]] and the [[River Kingdoms]] and near the [[Worldwound]], where [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] powers corrupt them into carnivorous beasts. Further afield bison can be found roaming across the vast steppes of central [[Casmaron]], in particular throughout the [[Grass Sea]] and are a common site across the nation of [[Karazh]].


## Domestication

> Bison are domesticated less frequently than aurochs, though they can be adopted as [[Animal companion|animal companions]] and a few [[Cavalier|cavaliers]] find ways to adopt bison as mounts. Bison can also be [[Magic/Conjuration|summoned]], and summoned bison persist longer when summoned by [[Divine magic|divine magic]] users of the [[Plains domain|plains]].
