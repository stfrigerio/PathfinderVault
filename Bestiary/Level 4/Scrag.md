> **Scrags** are amphibious [[Troll|trolls]] found in both salt and fresh water in any climate.
> Scrags are a distinct species from common trolls, more distantly related to their [[Mountain troll|mountain troll]] forebears. Female scrags give birth to litters of two to six offspring. Scrag broods often include a mutant runt, an *aruk-taii* ("half-scrag") or [[Flood troll|flood troll]], that is raised in its siblings' shadow or simply driven into the wild to fend for itself. The exception is when a brood includes a pair of twin runts, *aruk-taikii*, whom scrags view as an omen of storms and floods to come and are pampered by their mother.
