>  **Tigers** are large, [[feline]] apex predators that inhabit some temperate, tropical, and subtropical forest regions. They kill and eat all kinds of large [[Animals]], even other big cats. The deadliest tigers have developed a taste for [[Humanoid]] flesh and become man-eaters. Tigers thrive in areas that offer fresh water and cover from prey.



## Smilodon

>  **Smilodons**, also known as **dire tigers** and to primitive tribes as the **saber-toothed tiger**, is even bigger and stronger than the common tiger. These huge felines possess fangs the size of [[daggers]] that protrude even when their mouths are shut, and live in forests and grasslands. [[Taiga giants]] sometimes collect smilodon fangs.


## On Golarion

 A flaming tiger.
>  Tigers are among the most common great cats on Golarion.


### Habitats

>  Tigers can be found in many corners of the world, including the [[Mwangi Expanse]], the [[Takalak Hills]] on [[Motaku Isle]] in [[the Shackles]], the [[Tapur Forest]] of [[Qadira]], [[Vudra]], and parts of [[Tian Xia]].
>  Smilodons dwell in the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], the [[Mwangi Expanse]], [[Icemark]] and the [[Thanelands]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], and the [[Forest of Spirits]], among other places.


### As symbols

>  Tigers have been adopted by many nations and religions as symbols.
>  The tiger is one of the national symbols of [[Bachuan]], representing the indigenous people (in opposition to the government, represented by an [[Imperial dragon]]). The [[Tiger Lords]] tribe from the [[Stolen Lands]] of the [[River Kingdoms]] named themselves after the dire tiger, and revere an immense smilodon named Speartooth as their totem.
>  The tiger is sacred to the [[god]] [[Yaezhing]], who is depicted as a tiger-headed man with [[Human]] eyes. The goddess [[Chamidu]] is said to ride a tiger with human hands for paws. Cheu Chem, a servant of the god [[Irori]], is a sentient white tiger from the heavenly realms. White tigers are also among Irori's favored animals.
>  The tiger was the totem of Mahka Abihcara, the [[sorcerer]] who was reincarnated as the first [[Rakshasa]]. To this day, the majority of rakshasas have the heads of tigers, as do the [[rakshasa immortals]] [[Ravana]] and [[Aksha]].
>  The [[Empyreal lord]] [[Jaidz's]] natural form is a black tiger with ghostly white spots, and his [[sacred animal]] and rites of worship feature tigers. The tiger is also the sacred animal of the [[Infernal duke]] [[Ose]] and the [[harbinger]] [[Zelishkar]]. The saber-toothed tiger is the sacred animal of gods [[Zursvaater]] and [[Lanishra]].


### As lycanthropes

***Main article: [[Weretiger]]***
>  [[Lycanthropes]] who can take the form of a tiger are known as [[weretigers]], and are most common in [[Vudra]] and [[Tian Xia]].


## In the Great Beyond

>  Tree tigers with green rather than orange coats live in the canopy of the enormous trees of the [[Enchanted Wood]], in the [[Dreamlands]]. Unlike their more solitary kin on the [[Material Plane]], the Dreamlands' arboreal tigers live and hunt in small groups.
>  Worshippers of Irori who attain enlightenment before their deaths are transformed into tiger-like servitors of their god known as [[pavbaghas]].
