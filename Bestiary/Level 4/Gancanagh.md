> **Gancanaghs**, also known as **passion azatas**, are extraordinarily handsome [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azatas]] best known for open and free sexuality, and their defense of any who are persecuted for their own sexual preferences.



## Appearance

> Most gancanaghs resemble male-presenting [[Humanoid|humanoids]], though they can change their shape freely and revel in challenging [[Mortal|mortal]] interpretations of gender. They dress fashionably and carry accessories such as smoking pipesâ€”which they never use, since they despise smokeâ€”purely for their aesthetic value.


## Ecology

> Gancanaghs are earnest but incorrigible flirts who fixate on one paramour at a time. The gancanagh throws himself into wooing them in a brief fling before moving on to their next lover. Gancanaghs enjoy the beauty of [[Music|music]] and its ability to sway the heart, and cherish their flutes.


## Society

> Gancanaghs despise [[Succubus|succubi]] and [[Incubus|incubi]] over all other creatures: the existence of such [[Demon|demons]] profanes the spirit of romance with seduction and violence, and leads flirtatious [[Good|good]] people to be compared to [[Evil|evil]]. The greatest insult for a gancanagh is to be mistaken as such a demon, and many gancanaghs have challenged misinformed good people over such an offence.
> Gancanaghs are especially protective of [[Mortal|mortals]] who are open-minded about sexuality and gender, especially those who are persecuted for their beliefs. While they prefer to change the beliefs of such narrow-minded persecutors, they will still engage in reluctant combat to protect an ally in danger.
