> 
> A **griffon** is a large [[Magical beast|magical beasts]] with a [[Lion|lions]] body, an [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Eagle|eagles]] head and claws, and feathered wings. They are intelligent creatures, and while unable to speak can understand most [[Language|languages]] spoken by the [[Humanoid|humanoids]] living close to them. The name of this magical beast has a couple of variant spellings, namely **griffin** and **gryphon**.



## Appearance

> Most griffons found in [[Avistan]] are large creatures with the hindquarters of lions and the wing forequarters of brown-and-white eagles, but certain populations are known to resemble different types of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]] and [[Feline|felines]]. Desert-dwelling griffons often resemble tawny or black [[Hawk|hawks]] and [[Mountain lion|mountain lions]], while those found in jungles combine the bodies of [[Tiger|tigers]] and [[Panther|panthers]] with those of colorful parrots.
> In addition, a wingless type of griffon called the **alce** also exists. These are born when griffon eggs are brooded by their father rather than their mother. While flightless, alces are swifter runners than winged griffons.


## Ecology

> Griffons are predators, and are particularly fond of [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]] meat; they also hunt and eat [[Hippogriff|hippogriffs]].
> Male griffons attempt to impress females by bringing them gifts of meat and fruit, and thereafter through a complex aerial dance where the prospective mates engage in difficult aerial acrobatics. Griffons mate for life, and both mates rear the young; females typically brood the eggs while the males hunt to bring back prey to their mate and offspring, but on occasion, males can be the ones to brood the clutch. In these occasions, the chicks hatch as wingless alces instead of winged griffons.


## History

> The first griffons were created by [[Curchanus]], a [[Deity|god]] who ruled over the beasts of the world. Curchanus shaped the griffons in response to prayers from his worshippers by combining the features of two symbolically important and recognizable predators, the lion and the eagle, one representing the land and the other representing the air. These original griffons are believed to have been highly intelligent and to have protected their god's faithful, but they regressed into their current bestial state after Curchanus' murder by the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Lamashtu]].


## On Golarion

> Griffons favor highland areas as their homes, and are known to nest in the [[Storval Plateau]] of [[Varisia]], the [[Shattered Range]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]], and the [[Aspodell Mountains]] of [[Andoran]] and [[Cheliax]], among other mountainous regions. They hunt on the [[Nesmian Plains]] of southern [[Nirmathas]].
> A [[Half-fiend|half-fiend]] griffon named [[Karadoon]] lives in the [[Five Kings Mountains]]. A servant of the [[Demon|demon]] [[Treerazer]] who somehow escaped his imprisonment in [[Tanglebriar]], the fiendish griffon's brutal depredations on both [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and his fellow griffons have earned him a fearsome reputation in his new home.
> Griffons can also serve as mounts for [[Knight|knights]].
