> **Thognoroks** are a race of sentient symbiotes that are considered [[Divine servitor|divine servitors]] of [[Rovagug]], as they once lived off the Rough Beast's skin.


## Appearance

> A thognorok resembles an obscene [[Ooze|ooze]] that constantly lashes out with its [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spider]]-like, hairy, wriggling legs. A common thognorok measures about five feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds.


## Ecology

> Thognoroks are amphibious and endlessly hunger for [[Deity|divine]] flesh, whether Rovagug's or another deity's, consuming any foreign material on their way. While they obey all commands of Rovagug or his powerful priests, due to their tainted connection with him, thognoroks are usually left to rampage on their own. The exception is when they accumulate near [[Plane|planar]] [[Portal|portals]] on the [[Material Plane]], where Rovagug left behind some part of himself; in such cases, the thognoroks seek to fulfil the goal Rovagug was pursuing when he passed through that place.
