> **Arboreal wardens** are intelligent, sentient [[Arboreal|arboreals]] who serve as rangers and scouts for groves of arboreals.



## Appearance

> Arboreal wardens resemble [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Humanoid|humanoid]]-shaped trees and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Plant|plants]].


## Habitat

> Arboreal wardens are unusually struck by wanderlust for their kind, and as such are more likely to be found away from their forest homes. However, they typically report any dangers back to [[Arboreal regent|arboreal regents]], or attack in groups known as a "copse".


## Society

> Wardens have little interest in [[Mortal|mortals]] outside of their interest in a warden's forest.
