## Giant stag beetle

> A **giant stag beetle** is a [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]]-sized stag beetle. Like their smaller versions, they can fly, if clumsily. They often reside in marshes, caverns, and forests, where they occasionally come into conflict with logging camps.
> **Chapel beetles** are giant stag beetles trained to serve as [[Holy|holy]] mounts for [[Droskar]]-worshiping [[Duergar|duergar]] in the [[Darklands]]. These beetles carry priests of Droskar and are often inscribed with the [[Deity|deity]]'s symbol, allowing the priest to use them as living [[Holy symbol|holy symbols]] for channeling their god's power.
