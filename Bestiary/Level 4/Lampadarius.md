> **Lampadariuses** are the [[Divine servitor|divine servitor]] race of the [[Deity|god]] [[Zon-Kuthon]], and dwell with him on the [[Shadow Plane]]. A species of [[Velstrac|velstrac]], a lampadarius seeks to slowly transform its body by cutting out its flesh and replacing it with pieces of burning shadow from the [[Plane|plane]] itself.


## Appearance

> A lampadarius resembles an [[Evangelist|evangelist]] without any chains; instead, part of its face and several limbs have been replaced with shifting shadows. All lampadariuses have to keep the flesh-to-shadow ratio roughly equal, as too little shadow is insufficient to grant power and too much can turn them into shadow creatures. Lampadariuses stand just under sixÂ feet tall and weigh about 80 pounds.


## Ecology

> Lampadariuses indulge both their flesh's pleasures and their shadow body parts' pain in a careful balance. They seek a perfectly shadowy body, but miss their flesh and lost sensations.
