> On rare occasions, a [[Zombie|zombie]] retains intelligence and memories from its former life. Known as **zombie lords**, these [[Undead|undead]] creatures do not have their lesser brethrens' sluggish movement, and are generally a much greater threat as well. Some zombie lords are [[Consummate undead|consummate undead]] who pursued their fates.



## Variants


### Magus zombie


> **Magus zombies** are zombie lords animated from minor [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] who also retain their [[Spellcasting|spellcasting]] abilities. While similar to [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|liches]] in this regard, they are far less powerful. Some magus zombies pursued conscious life after death but lacked the power or resources to become a lich. Unlike zombie lords, they are also not necessarily limited to [[Evil|evil]] [[Alignment|alignments]].


#### Known magus zombies

> - [[Esme Verisi]], a unique example of an [[Alchemy|alchemically]] animated, intelligent, non-evil zombie
> - Leylani Marakhoum, a vain [[Geb's Rest|Gebbite]] aristocrat who failed to become a lich
