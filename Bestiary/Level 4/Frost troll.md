> A variant of the more common [[Troll|troll]], blue-skinned **ice trolls**, also known as **frost trolls**, dwell in the coldest reaches of the world, particular in the northernmost reaches of [[Golarion]].



## Appearance

> Ice trolls resemble their common relatives, but have pale blue skin and ice-like claws and teeth. They are somewhat slighter in frame than other trolls, and typically stand eleven feet tall when upright and weigh up to 900 pounds.


## Habitat and ecology

> Ice trolls dwell in the coldest reaches of the world and are particularly prominent in [[Irrisen]], where they serve the [[White Witches]] as merciless enforcers of their cruel rule from the frontier border region of [[Verge|the Verge]] to the capital of [[Whitethrone]], where ice trolls have been granted control of an entire district. While ice trolls live predominantly in northern latitudes, they have been reported increasingly often in temperate areas as well.
> Ice trolls might be smaller than normal trolls, but they are also much more intelligent, even using [[Weapon|weapons]] and [[Armour|armour]]. They typically hunt in packs of three, with one troll openly attacking the group's target while the other two study their prey's weaknesses before joining the fight. In the heat of battle, however, they are quite likely to abandon their weapons for the sheer joy of tearing an opponent to pieces with their own claws. Their intelligence also makes ice trolls tougher opponents, as rather than giving in to bestial rage, they instead employ cunning tactics to subdue those who use fire to bypass their natural regeneration. Ice trolls favor the taste of [[Human|human]] meat, and adjust their hunting grounds seasonally to remain close to their prey.  They sometimes capture humans and fatten them up to eat later.


## Society

> Ice troll society is based around small family groupings. Ice trolls are known to sometimes keep [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]] as much-abused pets, relying on their immunity to cold and trollish regeneration to survive the wolves' sharp fangs and freezing breath. Ice trolls often find themselves working alongside [[Frost giant|frost giants]].
