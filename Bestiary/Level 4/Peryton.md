With their shadow so transformed, the peryton gains a +2 status bonus to attack and damage rolls against that creature. In addition, each time the peryton successfully [[Strike|Strikes]] that creature, the creature must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or become [[frightened|frightened 1]], or increase its [[frightened|frightened]] condition by 1 if it's already [[frightened|frightened]]. This is an [[emotion]] and [[fear]] effect. The shadow remains transformed for 1 hour or until the peryton Mimics a Shadow again, whichever comes first."

> The peryton combines the body and forelegs of a stag with the wings and hind legs of a giant bird of prey and the head of a monstrous wolf with large antlers.


## Ecology

> Perytons have an insatiable hunger for warm hearts, which they tear from the bodies of their prey. They especially prefer humanoid hearts. Peryton mating is often fatal for the male. A fledgling peryton hatches from a foot-tall black egg after seven months.
