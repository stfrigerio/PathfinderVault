*See also: [[Half-janni]]Â and [[Suli|suli]]*
> **Jann** (singular **janni**) are the weakest members of [[Genie|geniekind]]. Composed of all four [[Element|elements]], they are most frequently found on the [[Material Plane]].



## Appearance

> Jann appear almost [[Human|human]], but have a definite mystical air to them, something that makes them both admired and distrusted by actual humans. Jann stand at least six feet tall and carry themselves with an unnatural grace. The only other giveaway to their nature is their eyes, which sparkle with an unnatural brightness.


## Habitat and ecology

> Jann favour the quiet isolation of the deepest desert and the most remote oases. Unlike other genies, the jann have no home [[Elemental Plane|elemental plane]]; instead they roam across the [[Material Plane]]. They keep their distance from humans, whom they distrust. They are drawn to places of natural beauty like the [[Painted Flutes]] and other natural wonders. Jann are unique amongst genies in that rather than being composed of a single element, they are instead made of a combination of all four. Despite their human appearance (which, if pointed out, would quickly offend), they are much stronger than they initially appear.
> Should a janni overcome its distrust of humans and procreate with one, the resulting child is a [[Half-janni|half-janni]], whose offspring with humans are called [[Suli|sulis]].
> Janni nobles are called **amirs**, and are the only genie nobles unable to grant *wishes*.

*For other meanings of "**Amir**", please see [[Amir disambiguation]].*

## On Golarion

> Clans of nomadic jann roam the deserts of [[Kelesh]]. They encourage their suli kinsmen to brag about their achievements and interact with humans, in the hope of making good impressions and softening the Keleshite government's stance on genie [[Slavery|slavery]].
