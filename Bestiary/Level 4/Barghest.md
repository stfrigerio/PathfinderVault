*See also: [[Greater barghest]]*
> The fiendish **barghest** is said to be related to the [[Goblinoid|goblinoid]] races of [[Golarion]]. It resembles a cross between a [[Wolf|wolf]] and a [[Goblin|goblin]] and comes to this world to feed on the flesh and [[Soul|souls]] of [[Mortal|mortals]].



## Appearance

> Being shapechangers, barghests can take on the form of a wolf or a goblin. Their natural shape is a [[Worg|worg-sized]] hybrid of the two. They generally walk on all fours, although their feet bear a greater resemblance to clawed hands than paws. Like goblins, they have oversized, pointed ears, a snub and nearly non-existent nose, and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth. Their powerful bite can tear through flesh and bone, and they can consume an entire [[Human|human-sized]] creature in under six seconds. Their bodies are covered with dark, matted hair, and they posses of wolf-like tail.
> Barghests possess a keen intelligence easily equal to that of most [[Humanoid|humanoids]], and possess innate [[Magic|magical]] abilities that allow them to charm prey, levitate, [[Teleportation|teleport]] across short distances, and avoid detection through [[Magic/Divination|divination]] magic. They can also insinuate themselves into the minds of their prey and flood them with thoughts of utterly hopeless despair.


## On Golarion

> Barghests come to Golarion to feed on humanoid flesh out of more than just hunger (which they certainly do not lack). They can become [[Greater barghest|greater barghests]] by consuming enough and returning to the [[Abyss]], although their lack of innate [[Planar travel|planar travel]] means such a return can take years for them to achieve.
> Being creatures of the [[Great Beyond]], barghests can be found in many parts of Golarion. They have been spotted in the hills around [[Bloodsworn Vale]], in the environs of the old [[Cheliax|Chelish]] capital of [[Westcrown]], in the [[Greenbelt]] region of the [[Stolen Lands]], near [[Canterwall]] in [[Ustalav]], roaming the [[Mana Wastes]], and leading goblin tribes in the [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Lambreth]].


### Connection to Lamashtu

> Although barghests are disciplined, cunning hunters who generally wish to have no part in the unbridled chaos of [[Demon|demons]], they share a special connection with the demon [[God|goddess]] [[Lamashtu]]. Scholars claim that in the time before time, the goddess freed a group of barghests kept in a kennel by the god [[Asmodeus]]. She elevated them to [[Demigod|demigod]] status and created small realms within her [[Abyssal realm]] for them. Goblins believe that the four strongest of theseâ€”[[Hadregash]], [[Venkelvore]], [[Zarongel]], and [[Zogmugot]]â€”founded their species. Worshipers of the Goddess of Monsters have been known to be able to [[Summon|summon]] these creatures as well.
