> The **sarcovalt** is a [[Divine servitor|divine servitor]] race of the [[Deity|goddess]] of [[Undeath|undeath]] and [[Disease|disease]], [[Urgathoa]]. They appear as tiny creatures that resemble an enormous fly with the neck and head of a fleshless-vulture. Sarcovalts serve Urgathoa and her faithful as scouts or guards, and help spread disease.
