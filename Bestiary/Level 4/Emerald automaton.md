> **Emerald automatons** are mindless [[Construct|constructs]] made from an [[Iron|iron]] frame and copper wiring, and [[Magic|magically]] powered by a fist-sized shard of the [[Emerald Spire]]. Emerald automatons can wield most kinds of [[Weapon|weapons]], are most often outfitted with [[Polearm|polearms]], and can also strike foes with a powerful slam. A damaged emerald automaton emits hazardous green energy from its cracked battery.
