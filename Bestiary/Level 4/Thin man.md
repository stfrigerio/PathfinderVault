> According to legend, **thin men** are a race of spirits that haunt the cane fields of the [[Rahadoum|Rahadoumi]] island of [[Nuat]]. The [[Pure Legion]] tolerates superstitious belief in the thin men, but some scholars speculate that they may in fact be an ancient race that claimed the island as home before the arrival of the Rahadoumi.
