> A **xocothian** is an intelligent, dualistic [[Outsider|outsider]] that resembles a combination of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|seabird]] and flying fish. They are closely linked with [[Gozreh]], the [[Deity|deity]] of sea and air.



## Appearance

> Xocothians have [[Serpent|serpentine]] bodies that are 8 feet long, with bird-like wings and beak and fish-like scales. They can also temporarily split into separate [[Air elemental|air]] and [[Water elemental|water elementals]].


## Abilities

> Xocothians can fly and swim with considerable speed, including extremely rapid bursts where they can span 200 feet of distance in a matter of seconds. They enjoy playing in and with clouds, and can also envelop themselves in mist to avoid being seen.


## Habitat and society

> While capable of communication, xocothians come across as curt and impatient with mortals and avoid most social nuance. They avoid pollution and despise polluters, even as minor as the effects of foul-smelling [[Spell|spells]] or burned garbage, and enjoy harrying [[Ship|ships]] at sea by flying past at great speed.
> When not summoned individually, they congregate in groups of up to five.
