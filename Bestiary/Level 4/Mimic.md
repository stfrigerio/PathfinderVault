A weapon that hits the mimic is stuck to the mimic and can be removed with a successful DC 23 [[Athletics]] check (made as a single action). A mimic can have any number of objects or creatures stuck to it at a time. The mimic can release a stuck creature or object by using a single action, and the adhesive dissolves 1 minute after the mimic dies, releasing all stuck objects and creatures."

![[Mimic.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A larval mimic.
> **Mimics**, or **multispothol**, are shapeshifters who get their name from their ability to mimic mundane objects, luring creatures into approaching them with their guard down.


## Appearance

> A mimic can have almost any dimensions, but usually is not more than 10 feet long. A typical mimic has a volume of 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet) and weighs about 900 pounds.


## Ecology

> Mimics are asexual, and reproduce via spores. When a mimic controls enough food and territory, it undergoes an involuntary internal change called spatter-spawning, laying out a large, thick glue-carpet of spore-rich protoplasm 30 or more feet in diameter. Having marked the walls and floor of a particular cavern or ruin with this stinking graffiti, it departs, never to return. Immature mimics bud out of the whitish glue-carpet, forming multi-hued, chitin-plated plasmoids the size of housecats; immediately ambulatory and capable of camouflage, these miniature mimics feed upon the glue-carpet, each other, and those helpless scavengers attracted by the stench and subsequently trapped by the glue.
