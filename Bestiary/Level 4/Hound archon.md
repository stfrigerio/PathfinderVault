> **Hound archons** are [[Outsider|outsiders]] of [[Heaven]] who often appear in muscular [[Humanoid|humanoid]]-like forms with [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|canine]] heads and features. They are skilled soldiers who lead Heavenly troops into frontline war and covert incursions alike, and are trained to use [[Greatsword|greatswords]] as well as their claws and teeth. Many take the form of [[Mortal|mortal]] [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|dogs]] when dispatched by [[Good|good]] [[Deity|deities]] to secretly guard certain people or sites.
> While typically highly disciplined and loathe to harm mortals, they mercilessly pursue [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]], particularly those that take canine forms such as [[Barghest|barghests]], [[Glabrezu|glabrezus]], and [[Yeth hound|yeth hounds]].
> When [[Summoned|summoned]], a hound archon prefers its summoner to find a permanent, safe home for a well-fed stray dog as an offering.
