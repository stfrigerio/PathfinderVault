> **Pavbaghas** are a race of [[Divine servitor|divine servitors]] who serve the [[Deity|god]] [[Irori]], and resemble white [[Tiger|tigers]] with blue stripes. They are formed from the [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] of the faithful who have lived enlightened lives of calm, patience, and wisdom.


## Ecology

> Pavbaghas are created from the souls of enlightened worshippers of Irori and, as such, are patient, wise, and self-controlled creatures, although they do not hesitate to leap into battle when necessary. They are devoted to serving their god and his followers by patrolling the borders of Irori's realm and watching over sacred sites and important [[Mortal|mortal]] worshippers on the [[Material Plane]]. They also enjoy training students and tracking and hunting prey. Like other [[Outsider|outsiders]], they have no need to eat, so pavbaghas do not kill their quarries; instead, they lay a single paw on them to signify their victory and then allow them to escape.
