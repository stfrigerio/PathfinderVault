> A **schir** is a [[Goat|goat-headed]] humanoid-shaped [[Demon|demon]] that is covered in a mangy grey hide that only partly covers its gaunt but muscled frame. They are also known as **spite demons**.



## Appearance

> A schir resembles a tall, muscular humanoid with the head and hooves of a [[Demon|demonic]] goat. A ragged hide covers patches of a schir's body, usually around the forearms and lower legs, with a crestlike patch running down from the creature's crown to the nape of its neck. Schir demons are seven feet tall, though they usually stoop and so appear shorter, and weigh 300 pounds.


## Ecology

> Schirs are among the most violent and vile-tempered inhabitants of the [[Abyss]]. Schirs are formed from the souls of mortals who either committed or framed others for heinous crimesâ€”acts committed for the sole purpose of petty retribution. Despite such origins, schirs occupy one of the lowest orders in the demonic hierarchy, often serving as front-line infantry in demonic armies or as guards for minor demonic commanders.
> Although not especially intelligent, schirs are cunning warriors and able sentries. Although they prefer to charge into combat, a schir's natural jumping ability makes it a nimble enemy, capable of using its surroundings astutely. A schir will often jump on top of rocks, crumbling walls, or any other high place to hack with its disease-ridden halberd. For all of schirs' capabilities, their spitefulness makes them distrustful of any creature that has not proven its greater power and strength numerous times.
> A schir set loose upon the [[Material Plane]] quickly seeks to set itself up as a leader of its own armyâ€”often, schirs seek out tribes of savage humanoids and attempt to replace the current leaders. They are particularly fond of infiltrating [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]] tribes.


## Grey pox

> A schir is forever gnawing at the ends of its halberd. This coats the blades with a distinctive [[Diseases of Golarion|disease]] from the demon's filthy spittle: grey pox. This disease is passed on by any halberd wound to another creature. Grey pox is an horrific disease that first weakens the victim and covers the body with grey markings on the skin; eventually comes catatonia.


## Rowdrosh

> The [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] [[Rowdrosh]], the Divine Herdsman, has a passionate hatred for schir demons and his followers target schirs for destruction.
