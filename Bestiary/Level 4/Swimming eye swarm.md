> **Swimming eyes** are a species of indescribable deep-dwelling, [[Jellyfish|jellyfish]]-like swarms.


## Appearance

> A swimming eye resembles a jellyfish with an uncannily [[Human|human]]-like eyeball suspended within the mesoglea.


## Ecology

> Swimming eyes are incredibly [[Venom|venomous]], with the eye being both a poison sac and sensory organ. This eye is remarkably fragile but can regenerate within less than a week.
