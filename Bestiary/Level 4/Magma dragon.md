> **Magma dragons** are a type of [[Primal dragon|primal dragon]] native to the Elemental [[Plane of Fire]].



## Appearance

> Magma dragons have black scales covered in rivulets of glowing lava.


## Habitat and Society

> Magma dragons are solitary creatures. They are temperamental creatures given to lashing out violently. Other dragons view them as dangerously unbalanced, with a great deal of justification. Magma dragons rarely feel the urge to explain their actions to others.
> An exception to the magma dragons' normally solitary lifestyles exists in the form of the Emberen Recess, a volcanic region in the Plane of Fire ruled by a collection of ancient magma dragons who govern their younger kin, and who are themselves led by the ancient dragon Caliniaya. The dragons of the Emberen Recess are served by [[Salamander|salamander]] slaves who guard their borders and mine gems for their hoards.


## Abilities

> As with all [[True dragon|true dragons]], Magma Dragons gain in power as they age. They have formidable physical abilities, and as they age they gain spell-like abilities and [[Sorcerer|sorcerous]] spellcasting.
> The bite of all but the youngest of magma dragons causes fire damage to those it bites, in addition to the normal bite damage. 
> Magma dragons' breath weapon is a cone of fire. Older magma dragons can instead breath a cone of clinging lava which continues to burn its victims after the initial inferno. The very oldest can spit a glob of fiery lava which cools rapidly and can trap a victim who somehow manages to survive the lava itself.
