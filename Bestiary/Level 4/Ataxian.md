> **Ataxians** are a [[Divine servitor|divine servitor]] race of the god [[Cayden Cailean]]. Small, [[Fey|faerie-like]] creatures with wings and amber skin. They have the remarkable ability to be able to track down bars and taverns, no matter what plane they are on, and someone always offers to buy them a drink. As such, they are the embodiment of Cayden's most positive stereotypes: the happy drunk.
