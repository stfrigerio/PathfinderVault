> **Horned archons**, also known as **stag archons**, are the [[Divine servitor|divine servitor]] race of the [[Deity|god]] [[Erastil]]. These [[Archon|archons]] resemble powerful [[Human|humans]] with the horned head and cloven feet of stags or [[Elk|elk]].


## Society and culture

> Horned archons serve [[Heaven]] as scouts and trackers, patrol the wildernesses of the [[Outer Sphere]], hunt [[Evil|evil]] beings, and keep smaller communities safe from harm. They perform a similar role when called to the [[Material Plane]], something typically done at the request of the patron Erastil, where they patrol dangerous frontiers, help [[Mortal|mortals]] in need, and drive off dangerous monsters.
> Because horned archons often patrol the wildernesses of [[Nirvana]] and [[Elysium]], they tend to be better at understanding the perspectives of other [[Celestial|celestials]] than other archons.
