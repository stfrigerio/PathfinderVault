> **Caligni stalkers**, also known by non-caligni as **dark stalkers**, are the sibling race to the smaller [[Caligni creeper|caligni creepers]] who dwell in [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Darklands]]. Caligni stalkers and caligni creepers form a physically dimorphic society that is part of the wider [[Caligni|caligni]] population. Caligni stalkers are often leaders of caligni communities. They typically pair up with a [[Dark caller|dark caller]] to help guide their clan, and use the caligni creepers to do the grunt work.

## Appearance

> Caligni stalkers typically stand tall at six feet, but are exceptionally thin, weighing only 100 pounds. Their pale skin is covered with remarkably clean wrappings over black [[Leather Armor|leather armor]].


## Abilities

> In melee combat, caligni stalkers often wield two [[Shortsword|shortswords]] and can coordinate attacks with caligni creepers under their command.


## Death

> As with all dying caligni, caligni stalkers blast energy which, in their case, is a burning white-hot flame.


## Environment


### Extraplanar

> In [[4712 AR]], [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] found evidence of caligni stalkers and [[Caligni slayer|caligni slayers]] worshipping the [[Evil|evil]] [[Tian Xia]] [[God|goddess]] [[Lao Shu Po]] in the *[[Hao Jin Tapestry]]*.
