> **Zhyen** are a minor type of [[Genie|genie]] native to the [[Elemental Plane|elemental planes]]. Curious beings, they can most often be found freely wandering their home [[Plane|plane]], but occasionally act as servants or messengers to more powerful beings. The [[Qadira|Qadiran]] arcanists known as [[Daivrat|daivrat]] occasionally choose these creatures as [[Familiar|familiars]].



## Appearance

> Zhyen appear as muscular [[Humanoid|humanoids]] from the waist up, similar to a miniature [[Djinni|djinni]], and dissipate into their favored element from the waist down.


## Jocta

***Main article: [[Jocta]]***
> A jocta is a zhyen [[Slavery|enslaved]] or bound to a cruel master who undergoes a physical transformation into a more humanoid form and sullen existence.


## On Golarion

> Planar scholars disagree on the nature and origins of zhyen. Some theorize that they are planar material that has separated and grown self-aware, others believe them to be a lesser form of genie, and still others postulate that zhyen are the wholesale creation of more powerful genies similar to the role a [[Homunculus|homunculus]] plays to a [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]].
