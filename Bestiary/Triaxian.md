> **Triaxians** are the most populous species on the [[Planet|planet]] [[Triaxus]], the seventh planet in [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Solar system|solar system]]. Triaxus' orbit causes centuries-long winters and summers; as their average lifespan is about 80 years, most Triaxians who remain on their home world experience nothing but one long winter or summer. They resemble other [[Humanoid|humanoids]] from [[Golarion]], [[Human|humans]] and [[Elves|elves]] in particular, but Triaxians develop certain adaptations to their strange world's environment that mark them as unquestionably alien.



## Appearance

> Like the varying cultures that make up the human race on Golarion, Triaxian populations vary in size, height, weight, and other strong physical characteristics depending on the regions they call home. Most Triaxians are around six feet tall, but are more lean compared to humans of equal height. It is rare to see a Triaxian who weighs over 200 pounds. They have elongated ears akin to elves and [[Halflings|halflings]], but unlike elves these appendages are notched in a comblike or vaguely feathered pattern. These notches create small flaps in a Triaxian's ears that seem to constantly move or adjust to listen to sounds, allowing them to focus on specific sounds much like [[Animal|animals]] with similar ears.


### Seasonal variation

> Like the many creatures that make up their world, the hardy Triaxians have evolved to shift with their environment. This adaptation creates many differences in generations within the same family line that would be seen as strange to Golarion humanoids.
> Triaxians differ significantly depending on the season in which they are born, owing to the length of Triaxus' seasons. The dark-skinned, wide-eyed Triaxians born in the summer phase are called **Summerborn,** while those born in the winter have white fur and light-shielding narrow eyes and are called **Winterborn**. Even those born away from Triaxus, regardless of the environment of their birthplace, take on the adaptations of their ancestral world's current season.
> Triaxians born during the relatively brief intermission between long seasons are **Transitional Triaxians.** They lack any of their kindred's adaptations, but many are particularly well-attuned to weather patterns, even when on worlds other than Triaxus.


### Other variants

> Owing to the large population of draconic creatures on the planet, there are known to be **dragon-blooded Triaxians**.


## Society and culture

> Along with their biological adaptations, Triaxian society changes with and adapts to the seasons. Their lifespans mean few Summerborn are alive for winter, and vice versa, and they know each other primarily through folklore. Summerborn are cavalier and restless, while Winterborn treasure honor and trust.
> Triaxian [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] known as season keepers use their homeworld's intense seasons to help their communities prepare for the coming change in seasons.


## Language

> Triaxians speak their own language, also called [[Languages of the Great BeyondTriaxian or Triaxian Common|Triaxian or Triaxian Common]]. It is a trade language spoken by many more creatures than just the Triaxian [[Humanoid|humanoids]]. Only [[Draconic language|draconic]] is as widely spoken and understood on the planet.
