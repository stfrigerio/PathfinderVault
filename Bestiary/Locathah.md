> A **locathah** is a [[Fish|fish-like]] bipedal [[Humanoid|humanoid]]. They have large eyes, ochre scales, and fins. They give off a fishy smell that many land dwellers find unpleasant, though they find their smell to be a key part of their race. Locathahs enjoy talking with the surface races, even hailing passing [[Ship|ships]] to trade and pass along information. This leads to sailors trusting them far more than the average surface dweller. An average specimen stands as tall as a [[Human|human]] and weighs 160 pounds. They move very slowly on land, but are swift and accomplished swimmers.


## Habitat and society

> Locathahs view community as very important, and go to great lengths not to abandon their fellows. They live a simple lifestyle, making crude tools out of stone, coral, and bone. They try to trade their knowledge of the local sea conditions with surface dwellers in return for ceramic and [[Metal|metal]] items.
> They eat mainly undersea [[Plant|plants]] and shellfish, supplementing this with occasional fish. They also enjoy eating tubers, when they can obtain them.
> Each tribe is led by a matriarch, who also serves as the main egg layer. Every adult then raises one of the young as their own. They often tame moray eels, and [[Warrior|warriors]] may use giant eels as mounts. They speak [[Languages of the Great BeyondAquan|Aquan]].


## On Golarion

> There are communities of locathahs in the [[Shackles]]. They can also be found in the [[Tian Xia]] nation of [[Kwanlai]]. Locathahs are the primary residents and rulers of the nation of [[Xidao]].
