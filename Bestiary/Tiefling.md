> **Tieflings** are [[Planar scion|planar scions]] native to [[Golarion]] who are mostly [[Human|human]], yet with the blood of [[Demon|demons]], [[Devil|devils]], or other [[Evil|evil]] [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] [[Outsider|outsiders]] in their veins. Also known colloquially (and somewhat pejoratively) as **hellspawn** or **devilblooded**, they are often distrusted and feared for this evil lineage. Even in infernal [[Cheliax]] where some tieflings serve as middlemen between the people and the denizens of [[Hell]], they are second-class citizens at best.



## Appearance

> Tieflings vary greatly in individual appearance from one another, depending not only on the ethnicity of the human parent but also the type of the [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] parent. They can have horns, greatly varying skin colors, hooves for feet, tails, unusual eyes, and so on. Tieflings descended from demons, for instance, often develop asymmetrical markings or growths, while tieflings descended from [[Div|divs]] tend to manifest various abnormalities related to their skin and those descended from [[Rakshasa|rakshasas]] typically develop animalistic appearances. These variances mean that two tieflings born from two different fiends might have vast differences in appearance.


## Adventurers

> For many tieflings, the life of an [[Adventurer|adventurer]] is a natural progression. A self-sufficient tiefling already relies on just a few chosen comrades, lives a traveller's existence to avoid trouble, and tends to have very developed opinions on good and evil and the necessity of intervening on one side or the other. Many tieflings become [[Rogue|rogues]] or [[Bard's End|bards]] as a means of survival, while others access the powers of their blood to become [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]]. Some become [[Wizard|wizards]], [[Monk|monks]], or [[Cleric|clerics]] in an effort to gain mastery over their fiendish corruption.


## Origins

> Though tieflings have the blood of fiendish beings, their ancestry is at least one step removed from the original introduction of that blood; the child of a union of a [[Mortal|mortal]] with a fiendish being is a [[Half-fiend|half-fiend]], not a tiefling. Tieflings might, but not necessarily, then be born from the union of the half-fiend with another mortal being. The possibility of a tiefling birth continues to many generations after that union, even when two mortals have children, so long as one of the mortals is a direct descendant of the half-fiend. Half-fiend creatures can be of many types, but it is found that tieflings are only possibly born from [[Humanoid|humanoids]].
> Tieflings are fertile in their own right, and it is common for them to have children and for those children to be tieflings in turn. However, a chance also exists for the child of a tiefling couple to be an outwardly normal member of her parents' species.


### Lineages

> Although the source of most tieflings' fiendish blood is unknown, there are some who can trace their tainted blood back to a specific type of fiend and their very personalities may be warped in a way echoing this ancestry. These tiefling lineages are as follows:















> - [[Asura-spawn]] (Faultspawn)
> - [[Daemon-spawn]] (Grimspawn)
> - [[Demodand-spawn]] (Foulspawn)
> - [[Demon-spawn]] (Pitborn)
> - [[Devil-spawn]] (Hellspawn)


> - [[Div-spawn]] (Spitespawn)
> - [[Velstrac-spawn]] (Shackleborn)
> - [[Oni-spawn]] (Hungerseed)
> - [[Qlippoth-spawn]] (Riftmarked, or the Motherless)
> - [[Rakshasa-spawn]] (Beastbrood)






## Society and culture

> Tieflings are rarely welcomed in humanoid society due to their fiendish descent and outwardly fiendish appearances. As such, many tieflings live in ghettos and other undesirable areas of their settlements. Some tieflings attempt to counteract this stigma by amassing personal wealth or power, while others seek to form communities with other tieflings where they can live without needing to hide their natures. Occasionally, tieflings may associate with other marginalized or distrusted species, such as [[Half-orc|half-orcs]].
> Some tieflings choose to ease their solitude by adopting pets. While many [[Animal|animals]] are instinctively put off by the scent of fiendish blood, this can be overcome with sufficient training. Additionally, tieflings are known to develop affinities for specific types of animals if they are descended from a fiend associated with specific creatures. A tiefling descended from a [[Vrock|vrock]] may share a bond with vultures, for example, while one descended from a [[Tiger|tiger]]-like rakshasa may have one with [[Cat|cats]].
> Tieflings are rarely religious, although some seek faith to find the acceptance and affection that their lives often lack. Many tieflings who tend towards religion are driven off from [[Good|good]] faiths by both their persecutions of tiefling-kind and by the thought of sharing an afterlife with people who despise them, leading them to the worship of [[Evil|evil]] [[Deities|deities]] or of powerful fiends. However, many revere [[Neutral|neutral]] deities such as [[Gorum]] or [[Nethys]], who value a worshipper's abilities and actions more than their race or appearance, or more open-minded good deities such as [[Desna]]. Many religious tieflings become [[Inquisitor|inquisitors]], distancing themselves from their persecuted past by themselves becoming the ones seeking out impurities and heresies.


## On Golarion

> Tieflings often face discrimination in the nations of the [[Inner Sea region]]. Chelish tieflings form an oppressed underclass despite their association with the devils that the empire often works with, as the nobility of Cheliax views devils as servants to be [[Binding outsiders|bound]] and controlled and dislikes the thought of uniting mortal and infernal blood. Tieflings of demonic blood or otherwise non-infernal fiendish heritages face even greater prejudice, and are rarely tolerated within Cheliax's borders. Chelish tieflings fleeing discrimination often head to Cheliax's neighbor and rival, [[Andoran]], but can find themselves facing prejudice there as well due to their association with fiends and Cheliax's infernal regime.
> Tieflings face greater discrimination in [[Jalmeray]], where they are considered unclean and relegated to jobs such as sewage and garbage collection and life in crowded ghettos. Most Jalmeri tieflings are beastbroods descended from rakshasas.
> Likewise, tieflings are rarely welcomed in [[Mendev]] and other lands affected by the demons of the [[Worldwound]], where they are seen as agents of their demonic progenitors. Mendevian tieflings are often killed as soon as they are discovered, forcing them to live in hiding or head south to less hostile lands. Tieflings born within the Worldwound itself find little acceptance from either their mortal parents, who see them as unwelcome reminders of their fates, or their demonic ones, who see them as either [[Slave|slaves]] or mortal victims like all others.
> In [[Tian Xia]], the nation of [[Chu Ye]] is home to numerous hungerseed tieflings descended from the nation's [[Oni|oni]] rulers, who use their descendants as agents and spies. Tieflings are also found in [[Shenmen]], where the difficulty of day-to-day life allows them to find acceptance among villagers more concerned with whether they can aid in their towns' survival than in their heritage.
