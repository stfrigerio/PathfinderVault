*This article is about the [[Construct|construct]] subtype. For creatures that have been described generically as robots, see [[Automaton|automaton]] and [[Clockwork|clockwork]]. For the construct-like race sometimes confused with robots, see [[Android|android]].*
> **Robots**, sometimes also known as **metal men**, are [[Construct|constructs]] of otherworldly design and manufacture that first came to [[Golarion]] long ago in [[Ship|ships]] that crashed on the plains of [[Numeria]]. They emerged, or were recovered, from its scattered ruins, but seemed to resist all methods of control, obeying a logic or programming all their own. The only exception to this were the [[Gearsman|gearsmen]], [[Humanoid|humanoid]] robots found in great numbers by the [[Technic League]] in the ruins of [[Silver Mount]] in [[Starfall]].

> Some ingenious Numerian [[Orc|orcs]] have mastered 'taming' robots to serve as intimidating metallic mounts. Their control of these so-called 'mounts' is far from complete as orcs struggle with even basic comprehension of the strange, alien [[Technology|technology]] that underpins their robotic steeds.
