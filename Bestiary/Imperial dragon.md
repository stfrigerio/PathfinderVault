> **Imperial dragons**, sometimes termed **dragons of the celestial host**, are a type of [[Dragon|dragon]] and [[Serpent|serpentine]] agents of cosmic balance native to [[Tian Xia]]. Like other [[True dragon|true dragons]], they grow in power as they age.



## Appearance

> Although they are true dragons, imperial dragons differ in appearance from other true dragons, possessing a long serpentine body. They lack wings but can fly gracefully through supernatural means. All imperial dragons have large horns with which they can gore prey and foes.


## Abilities

> Like all dragons, imperial dragons can breathe potent torrents of [[Element|elemental]] force, cast [[Spell|spells]], and perform other supernatural feats. Additionally, all can [[Magic|magically]] transform themselves into a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] shape. Indeed, imperial dragons are generally considered to be the most likely of the true dragons to use this shape changing ability. Imperial dragons abilities are defined by the cycles of elements that underpin their magic. Two cycles exist. In the first, each element feeds the successive element (wood, fire, earth, metal, water, wood), and in the second, each element counters its successive element (wood, earth, water, fire, metal, wood). For example, the abilities of the [[Underworld dragon|underworld dragon]], closely associated with fire, correspond to feeding earth, being fed by wood, countering metal, and being countered by water.


## Habitat and society

> Imperial dragons are defenders of ancient lands and protectors of cosmic balance. They take a much more active role in humanoid societies than their [[Metallic dragon|metallic]] or [[Chromatic dragon|chromatic]] kin, to such a degree that the kingdoms of Tian Xia are often known as the Dragon Empires. Imperial dragons are seen by humanoids as either benevolent guardians or vile threats depending on their type.


### Religion

> More than any other dragons, imperial dragons are closely tied to the religious beliefs of their native lands. Several [[Deity|deities]] of the Dragon Empires are often depicted in the form of a dragon, including [[General Susumu]], [[Lady Nanbyo]], and [[Shizuru]].


## On Golarion

> Imperial dragons inhabited Tian Xia in the [[Age of Dragons]], long before other races arose there, and were charged by the gods to safeguard the land in anticipation of [[Human|humanity]]'s arrival. Imperial dragons are deeply tied to the [[Human|human]] cultures of [[Tian Xia]], and many of the eastern gods may in fact be incredibly powerful dragons. The five imperial families of [[Minkai]] were blessed by the goddess [[Shizuru]] in her guise as a dragon, the nation of [[Quain]] relies on the powerful [[Celestial Dragon]] for guidance, and the empire of [[Xa Hoi]] is directly ruled by a dynasty of [[Sovereign dragon|sovereign dragons]]. Imperial dragons are active in times of social upheaval; though they have been slow to react to the fall of [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]], they are beginning to exert sweeping influence on the chaotic Dragon Empires.
> The [[Tian human ethnicity|Tian]] people believe that imperial dragons are guardians of the [[Zodiac|zodiac]], and each of the five species of imperial dragon is represented as a [[Constellation|constellation]].
