> **Ether frogs** look like nothing more so than an oversized, four-legged blister with nostrils and a mouth. With an undifferentiated body and head, these ghost-white amphibians hide a single overdeveloped parietal eye beneath their bulbous backs, which grants them the ability to see in the pitch black depths of [[Orv]] despite their lack of normal eyes. Most creatures avoid the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Frog|frogs]], knowing of their natural [[Poisons of Golarion|poison]]. In all other ways, however, they are simply largish frogs. Even though ether frogs are found primarily in the vaults of Orv, they can also occasionally be discovered in [[Sekamina]], and even [[Nar-Voth]].
