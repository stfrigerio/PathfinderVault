> Whether born naturally or afflicted with the [[Curse|curse]] of [[Lycanthropy|lycanthropy]], **wereboars** are [[Lycanthrope|lycanthropes]] who can switch between [[Humanoid|humanoid]] and [[Boar|boar]] form. They are one of the most feared types of lycanthrope.


## Appearance

> Like all lycanthropes, wereboars have three formsâ€”a humanoid form, a boar form, and a hybrid form. 
> A wereboar in boar form looks like a normal [[Animal|animal]], although often a particularly strong and tough specimen. Perceptive observers might also identify that the creature has more than animal intelligence.
> Afflicted wereboars in humanoid form keep their previous appearance (although they often become more bad-tempered). Natural wereboars tend to be stout, with bristly hair and a noticeable overbite. Hair is often red, brown, or black, and while chin whiskers are common in males, they often cannot grow full beards.
> Wereboars can also take on a hybrid form which combines their humanoid form with boar-like features. In this form they resemble a hairy humanoid with a boar-like head complete with sharp tusks.


## Habitat and ecology

> Wereboars are often stubborn, aggressive and bad-tempered. They gather together in their own communities, and tend to have large families. Other creatures prefer to avoid them as they are quick to anger.
> They are slow to make decisions, and equally slow (and stubborn) about changing their minds. They dislike other races, and are often embarrassed by what they consider to be their grotesque and graceless other forms. Thus they often avoid appearing in their bestial forms unless they intend to kill.
