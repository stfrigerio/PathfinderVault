> **Typhilipedes**, or **eye biters**, originated from gnats trapped inside the [[Wax Tower]] that were corrupted by [[Hell]]. Though usually found in [[Erebus]], small colonies are sometimes made in the [[Darklands]]. These infernal pests hunt [[Soul|souls]] and other creatures in large swarms. Typhilipedes prefer to devour the raw energy of light, which makes traversing Erebus even more dangerous for outsiders as even a single candle can be spotted from miles away and cause one to be descended upon by an entire swarm.
