> **Leopards** are large, spotted [[Cat|cats]] roughly four feet in length, with golden sides, backs and heads, and white undersides. Numerous similar creatures are found in [[Golarion]], including some adapted for environments other than tropical forests, such as **jaguars**, **panthers** or **black panthers**, **snow leopards**, and **cougars**.



## Ecology

> Leopards are ambush predators, perching on top of high branches or rocks and waiting to pounce on prey passing beneath. They typically hunt a range of prey from small arthropods to large herbivores, although they generally favor quarry between these extremes. They usually never threaten [[Humanoid|humanoids]], but those that live near settled areas have the potential to become significant threats.


## In religion

> Leopards are the [[Sacred animal|sacred animals]] of the [[Osirian pantheon|Osirian]] [[Deity|goddess]] [[Maat]] and of the [[Malebranche|malebranche]] [[Barbariccia]].
