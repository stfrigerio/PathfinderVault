 Guttugger, an [[Intelligent animal|awakened]] deinonychus.
> A **deinonychus** is a bipedal, medium-sized [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaur]] that often hunts in packs of up to 12. It has brightly coloured scales, and despite being a comparatively small dinosaur is known for its ferocity.
> They move faster than [[Tiger|tigers]], and are every bit as adept at pouncing on their prey. In a fight they are agile enough to use their powerful hind claws as well as their smaller front claws, and can also use their sharp teeth.
> Several closely related types of dinosaurs are known to exist, such as the smaller [[Velociraptor|velociraptor]] and the larger **megaraptor**.
