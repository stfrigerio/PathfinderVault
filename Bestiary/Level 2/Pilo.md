> **Pilos**, also called **tumblespikes**, are an alien species of carnivorous, [[Poisons of Golarion|venomous]], marsupial [[Animal|animals]] from the distant desert [[Planet|planet]] [[Kasath]]. They were brought to [[Golarion]] on the [[Spaceship|spaceship]] *[[Destiny]]*, and while most of the specimens on the ship died in its [[Rain of Stars|crash]] thousands of years ago, a few survived and have established a small colony in [[Numeria]].


## Appearance

> A pilo has six legs, thick yellow quills, and a long, jagged snout. They are three feet long, and weigh about 80 pounds due to their dense musculature and heavy spikes.


## Ecology

> Despite their small size, pilos are aggressive and sometimes attack even larger predators, which often leave pilos alone. Pilos are also venomous, transferring their poison through their quills.
> When threatened, pilos can defensively curl up into a ball while retaining their ability to move, albeit more slowly. Pilo mothers also roll up into a ball to protect their young, which they carry in a pouch.
> Despite their aggression, pilos can be trained.
