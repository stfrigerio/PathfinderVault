> **Crocodiles** are large, carnivorous reptiles that can be found along the banks of [[Golarion|Golarions]] tropical and sub-tropical rivers and marshes. They are part of the [[Crocodilian|crocodilian]] family of reptiles. They prefer to hide partially submerged at the edges of streams and swamps and wait for prey to approach, whereupon they burst from the water with astonishing speed, grasp their victims in their powerful jaws and drag them underwater. They typically grow to about 14 feet in length, and weigh upwards of 1,400 pounds.



## Variants


### Dire crocodiles

> The **dire crocodile** (or **sarcosuchus**) is a monstrously large cousin of the common crocodile, found near the banks of [[Golarion|Golarions]] rivers and swamps. They have been spotted in such diverse climes as the banks of [[Lake Encarthan]] in central [[Avistan]], and the island of [[Jalmeray]] in the [[Obari Ocean]] (where locals call them *Mukara* and believe them to be the mounts of an unnamed goddess of rivers). Dire crocodiles are among the many animals that can be summoned by powerful [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] and other magic-users.


### Hetkoshu

> **Hetkoshu** are black-scaled dire crocodiles native to the rivers of [[Osirion]] (the [[Sphinx River|Sphinx]], the [[Crook River|Crook]], and the [[Asp River|Asp]]), in addition to the [[Golden Oasis Osirion|Golden Oasis]] at the edge of the city of [[Shiman-Sekh]]. Averaging 30 feet in length and weighing up to 45,000 pounds, hetkoshu pose a significant threat to the people who live in close proximity to their hunting grounds, and are considered to be one of the most dangerous [[Animal|animals]] in all [[Garund]]. Hetkoshus prefer to attack from surprise, rushing their prey with incredible speed and devouring one or more of their victims whole before they even realize that they are in danger. Any who survive this initial onslaught are quickly dragged into the dreaded "death roll", in which the hetkoshu tucks in its legs and rolls, wrenching its victims back and forth.


 

Sajan wrestles a crocodile, albeit a small one.
### Marine and saltwater crocodiles

> **Marine and saltwater crocodiles** are sea or ocean variants of the standard crocodile with the latter variant the larger of the two at about twice the size of a land-based crocodile.

## Alligators

> **Alligators** are in the same family as and are very similar to crocodiles, with most of their differences being in their snout, teeth, and preference for freshwater habitats over salt water. However, they are considered a distinct species.
