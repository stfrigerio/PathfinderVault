> **Tritons** are a benevolent aquatic race found in oceans across the world. Though they originated on the [[Plane of Water]], they long ago migrated to [[Golarion]] and are now a native race.



## Appearance

> Tritons are comparable in appearance to [[Merfolk|merfolk]], but with two scaly finned legs instead of a [[Fish|fish]] tail. They are athletic in build and covered in silvery scales that shimmer blue and green in the light. Older tritons may have parasites like barnacles or coral growing on their bodies, but they wear them as a mark of pride. Their hair is white, blue, or green. Most tritons are the same size as [[Human|humans]], but a handful grow twice as tall; such giant tritons are regarded as heroes of their people.


## Habitat and society

> Tritons are capable of walking on land, but they are slow and clumsy, vastly preferring the mobility granted by their native salt-water environments. They are self-appointed watchers of the sea, patrolling the waves with the help of [[Dolphin|dolphins]] and other aquatic beasts. Tritons hate evil sea monsters like [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]], [[Kraken|krakens]], [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]], and [[Skum|skum]], and have waged many wars against such creatures.
> Tritons live in underwater cities, usually built around [[Volcano|volcanic]] vents for the heat and abundant food. Their homes are sculpted from stone or grown from living coral. They are distrustful of outsiders, especially surface-dwellers, but usually have a few dry, airtight buildings set aside for visitors.
> A militant race, tritons gather into strong aquatic cavalry units to patrol against their enemies. They build relationships with other aquatic races (such as [[Tidepool dragon|tidepool dragons]], and aquatic [[Storm giant|storm giants]]) for the mutual defense of the sea. Though they regard surface-dwellers as trespassers beneath the waves, tritons are quick to change their opinions if they witness an air-breather performing acts of courage and welcome such heroes with open arms. They are known to manufacture specialized magical items (such as the powerful [[Horn of the tritons|horn of the tritons]]) to assist them in the defense of their territories.


## On Golarion

> Although tritons can be found in nearly all of Golarion's oceans, they are particularly common in the [[Arcadian Ocean|Arcadian]], [[Embaral Ocean|Embaral]], and [[Okaiyo Ocean|Okaiyo]], as well as the [[Inner Sea|Inner]], [[Shining Sea|Shining]], and [[Songil Sea|Songil]] seas. They are also minority populations in the unusual [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Outsea]] (where they were staunch allies of the merfolk against the sahuagin), as well as the aquatic nation of [[Xidao]] between [[Minkai]] and mainland [[Tian Xia]]. They prefer to live near shorelines and in the shallows of these waters, disliking the dark depths. Triton communities often form alliances with local [[Locathah|locathah]] and merfolk populations, but remain bitter rivals of alghollthus and their former servants, the [[Skum|skum]], [[Kraken|krakens]], and sahuagin.
> Though most of their kind migrated to the [[Material Plane]], small kingdoms of tritons still exist on the [[Plane of Water]].
