> The **pteranodon** is a species of [[Pterosaur|pterosaur]] that can be identified by its backward-sweeping head crest. It can fly fairly swiftlyâ€”at the same speed a [[Tiger|tiger]] can runâ€”but is clumsy in the air. It attacks with its long beak, and will sometimes land to attack prey too large for it to carry off. A typical specimen has a 20-foot wingspan but weighs only 40 pounds. Pteranodons are typically found in flocks of up to 12, usually near where [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaurs]] live.
