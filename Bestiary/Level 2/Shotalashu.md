> **Shotalashu**, also known as **shota**, are large reptilian [[Magical beast|magical beasts]] native to [[Castrovel]]. They can form [[Telepathic|telepathic]] connections much like the [[Lashunta|lashunta]] of Castrovel, and as such often serve them as enthusiastic mounts.



## Appearance

> A shotalashu, which averages more than 10 feet in length and 1,000 pounds in weight, has reptilian features with a long neck and thick, whip-like tail. Its body is built for speed and power, with muscular hind quarters and shoulders.


## Abilities

> Shotalashu are at home in dense jungles and move easily through them. Their innate telepathic sensitivity make them adept mounts for telepaths with a minimum of training, but also deepens the loss and pain when a shotalashu or its rider dies while bonded.


## On Castrovel

> While the telepathic bond between a lashunta rider and her shota mount is effortless, few lashunta form lifelong bonds with a single mount. However, the death of a bonded mount can cause [[Psychic magic|psychic]] damage that heals slowly, while a bonded rider's death can make a shota difficult to communicate with and resistant to bonding with a new rider.
