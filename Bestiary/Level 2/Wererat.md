> Whether born naturally or afflicted with the curse of [[Lycanthropy|lycanthropy]], **wererats** are [[Lycanthrope|lycanthropes]] who can switch between [[Human|human]] and [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Rat|rat]] form and are common in crowded and dirty cities. They are one of the two most common forms of [[Lycanthrope|lycanthrope]] (the other is the [[Werewolf|werewolf]]) and one of the most feared. They are also among the physically weakest, so rely on stealth and cunning to survive.


## Appearance

> Like all lycanthropes, wererats have multiple forms, the most mundane forms they take are either as regular humans or rats. Whilst an infected wererat human form looks like they did before they were [[Curses of Golarion|cursed]] (although sometimes taking on rat-like mannerisms) natural wererats tend to be short and wiry, often with a nervous disposition and darting rodent-like eyes. Wererats can also take on a hybrid from which combines their [[Humanoid|humanoid]] form with rat features. In this form they gain a long, twitchy tail, fur covers their whole body and their head becomes that of a rat giving them a nasty bite.


## Habitat & Ecology

> Wererats almost always dwell in cities for it is there where rats and humans most commonly co-habit and so it is where a wererat can most easily blend in. Many cities have wererat infestations from lawless slums like [[Riddleport]] to well-run cities like [[Korvosa]]. Because of their ability to blend in as rats and the mobility this grants them, wererats often find work in a thieves' guild. The most dangerous thing about a wererat is its ability to spread the curse of lycanthropy; anyone bitten risks contracting the curse, and while those born as wererats can control their shapeshifting, those cursed with it are not so lucky.
> They are extremely conscious of the need for secrecyâ€”a city that feels itself to be infested with wererats is likely to erupt into violence and paranoia, which is bad for all concerned. As a result, the head of the guild usually controls who can be infected by lycanthropy, and will ensure all necessary measures are taken to maintain their secrecy.
