> **Aurochs** are large migrating herd mammals, standing over 7 feet tall at the shoulder, which are closely related to domesticated [[Cattle|cattle]]. They resemble large, razor-horned [[Bison|bison]].



## Ecology

> Aurochs travel in herds, following the grass that quickly crops up in these volatile climates. They travel in this way to protect each other, adult males forming a ring around those less able to defend themselves when threats arise. Aurochs are most often used by people as a source of meat, wool, and leather.


### On Golarion

> There are various breeds, ranging from those found in the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] to [[Hold of Belkzen|Belkzens]] southern floodplains. Large herds of aurochs are also found on the [[Nesmian Plains]] of southern [[Nirmathas]]. An especially large and aggressive breed, the **Storval aurochs**, wanders through the [[Storval Plateau]] and the [[Cinderlands]] of [[Varisia]].
