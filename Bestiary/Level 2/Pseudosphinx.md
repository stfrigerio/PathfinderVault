> **Pseudosphinxes** are diminutive relatives of true [[Sphinx|sphinxes]] with the bodies of [[Cat|housecats]], the wings of [[Falcon|falcons]], and the heads of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Monkey|monkeys]]. They possess the ability to tap into their greater kin's knowledge in order to answer a single question for another creature.
> The pseudosphinxes' precise origins are not known. They may be descended from lesser sphinxes or be the result of [[Magic|magical]] experimentation.
> Pseudosphinxes are solitary creatures, but are sometimes taken as [[Familiar|familiars]].
