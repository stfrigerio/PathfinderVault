> **Vargouilles** (pronounced var-GWEEL) are grotesque flying heads with [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bat]]-like wings originally from the [[Lower Planes]]. Despite their otherworldly origins, they can be found throughout the [[Material Plane]], especially near old battlefields, graveyards, or other locations that have seen much death. Their putrid kiss can transform their victims into vargouilles.
