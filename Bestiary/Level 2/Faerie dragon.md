> **Faerie dragons** are mischievous [[Dragon|dragon]]-kin with colorful [[Butterfly|butterfly]] wings that are related to [[Pseudodragon|pseudodragons]]. They are mischievous and fun-loving creatures, and spend a good deal of their time preparing for, or playing, elaborate pranks and jokes. They often ally with [[Fey|fey]], but they also partner with [[Adventurer|adventurers]] that they deem as suitably interesting or entertaining.


## Ecology

> Faerie dragons do not change in size as they age, unlike [[True dragon|true dragons]], but rather change in color. Their scales, red at birth, shift through the colors of the rainbow as the dragon ages, settling into a deep violet in old age.


## In Golarion

> Bands of faerie dragons live on the shores of [[Lake Silverstep]], in the [[Stolen Lands]], alongside several fey. They are also among the creatures found in the [[First World]].
