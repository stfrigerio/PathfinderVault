> **Pipefoxes** are infinitely curious and hold themselves aloof from the 'lesser minded.' They prefer to observe from afar, though they may choose to interact with those they find curious or who share a common interest in acquiring knowledge. They seek out all knowledge, including the obscure, but rarely share what they know without a "payment" of knowledge in return. In rare cases, after observing a particularly interesting individual for a time, they may approach that person and offer to join them for a time as their confidant or [[Familiar|familiar]].


## Appearance

> A pipefox is a furry, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fox|fox]]-headed [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake]].


## Ecology

> These secretive creatures can be found coiled around trees or skulking around places of knowledge.
