> **Paracletus** [[Aeon|aeons]] serve as agents who study the influence of emotions upon [[Mortal|mortal]] behaviour.


## Appearance

> A paracletus resembles a small cluster of shimmering lights floating in the air, orbited by multiple vibrant crystals and [[Gem|gemstones]]. The crystals are solidified aspects of logic, while the swirling vapours and lights that make up its central mass are manifestations of raw emotion. Although the central mass of a paracletus appears to be made of light and energy, it is solid and feels like electrified flesh to the touch. They look very similar to [[Aeon wyrd|aeon wyrds]] but are different creatures.


## Ecology

> Paracletuses wander the [[Plane|planes]] seeking mortals with particularly strong emotional or logical capabilities and study their relationship with emotional and logical input and choices. Often, a paracletus will use its emotion aura on the target in order to study how they can be affected by outside influences. Whether or not the paracletus uses a helpful or harmful effect is unpredictable and completely random from the view of the target, even though to the paracletus' complex reasoning, nothing is left to actual random chance.
> Paracletuses prefer influencing situations with their emotion auras to fighting. If forced to fight, the paracletus slams at foes and discharges energy in addition to buffeting with its crystalline components. When a paracletus is slain, the entire creature fades away into nothingness.
> A paracletus [[Familiar|familiar]] does not abandon its mission to observe emotions and logic at play, but it does follow its master's orders, and in this situation the application of its emotion aura is less random.
