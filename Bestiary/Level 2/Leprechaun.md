> **Leprechauns** look like small [[Humanoid|humanoids]] with pointed ears, green eyes, and a wicked grin. They carry a bottle in one hand and a [[Club|club]] in the other.
> Leprechauns are small, fun-loving tricksters. They are most commonly found in forests and share the close connection with nature that is possessed by most [[Fey|fey]] creatures. Leprechauns love playing tricks on unknowing passers-byâ€”almost as much as they love a fine bottle of [[Alcoholic beverages|wine]] and a plateful of hot food in their bellies. They often steal something of worth from [[Adventurer|adventurers]] just to provoke a chase. Using their ability to disappear at will to its full potential, they wait until their victims appear to be about to give up the chase before reappearing once more to let the chase resume. They are not greedy creatures, and eventually drop what they stole, slipping away while their angry pursuers claim the lost property. The exception is [[Gold|gold]]â€”leprechauns love gold and often hoard it in secret, hidden places. It is rumoured that a person who finds a [[Gold coin|gold coin]] in the forest and returns it to the leprechaun that dropped it will be granted a wish as a reward. Unfortunately, these rumours are falseâ€”likely perpetuated by the leprechauns themselves in order to trick others into bringing them gold.
> Leprechauns prefer not to kill other creatures unless the ones attacking them are malicious or known enemies of the forest or fey. They often use their powers to befuddle and annoy [[Evil|evil]] folk, tricking creatures such as [[Goblin|goblins]] and [[Orc|orcs]] into thinking a forest is haunted.


## Gnomes

> Leprechauns are most closely related to [[Gnome|gnomes]], although the extent of the migration of gnomes to the [[Material Plane]] means gnomes are no longer classified as fey. Leprechauns' dalliance with the [[Plane of Shadow]] is still not as strong as their core tie to the [[First World]] and so they do remain classified as fey.
