> **Werecrocodiles** are a type of [[Werecreature|werecreature]].


## Appearance

> In their [[Humanoid|humanoid]] form, werecrocodiles are typically tall and powerfully built. Their skin may appear slightly rigid,  and some have a green tinge to their lips or vertically slitted pupils.


## Ecology and Habitat

> Werecrocodiles usually have their lairs in warm swamps, rivers, and coastal areas. They prefer to eat humanoids, but will subsist on [[Fish|fish]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|waterfowl]] if necessary. They sometimes pose as guides in order to lure their victims away from safety. They prefer to drown their prey, and it is rare for them to deliberately inflict their [[Curses of Golarion|curse]] on others.
