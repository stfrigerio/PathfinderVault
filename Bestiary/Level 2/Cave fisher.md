    desc: "â¬»  The cave fisher pulls a creature [[grabbed|grabbed]] by its filament toward itself, even suspending the target vertically if necessary. The cave fisher attempts an [[Athletics]] check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the cave fisher pulls the creature 15 feet closer to it (30 feet closer on a critical success)."
  - name: "Sticky Filament"
    desc: "  Any creature hit by the cave fisher's sticky filament is [[grabbed|grabbed]]. The cave fisher can move while it has a creature [[grabbed|grabbed]] with its filament, but it automatically releases the creature if the cave fisher moves beyond the filament's 60-foot length. The cave fisher can use only one filament at a time, and it can sever the filament and release any creature [[grabbed|grabbed]] by it as a free action. The filament can be severed by a [[Strike]] that deals at least 10 slashing damage to it. This doesn't deal any damage to the cave fisher itself. The filament has AC 17, and its [[Escape]] DC is 19."

> A **cave fisher** is an unintelligent subterranean predator that catches its victims by attaching a long, sticky filament to them, which it then reels in.  They generally wait on the high walls or ceilings of caverns, often near sources of water or other locations of increased traffic.

## Cave fishers in Golarion

> Cave fishers can be found in nearly any underground environment, preferring the upper reaches of [[Nar-Voth]], where easy prey is more common.  Sightings have occurred in the maze of tunnels beneath the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]], in the [[Endless Gulf]], far below the [[Aspodell Mountains]] of [[Andoran]], and in the salt caverns below the [[Collapsed Halls]] in central [[Cheliax]]. In [[Garund]], cave fishers are known to lurk in the cave passage of [[Lubber's Lurk|Lubbers Lurk]] preying upon those entering [[Port Peril]] overland.
