> En masse, the ooze-insect hybrid creatures known as [[Torble|torbles]] can form swarms of hundreds of individuals. Swarms of a certain size can form a hivemind, although individual torbles are vulnerable to telepathic control. Although lone torbles are scavengers, in swarms they hunt, and there are some indications that swarms are territorial.
