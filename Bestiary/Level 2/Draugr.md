> **Draugr** are [[Undead|undead]] formed of those who died at sea or in another aquatic environment suffused with [[Necromancy|necromantic]] energy or haunted by [[Evil|evil]] [[Spirit|spirits]].



## Appearance

> Draugr appear quite similar to the more common [[Zombie|zombies]] except their flesh is normally encrusted in barnacles and other nautical debris. They also constantly drip water and have a distinctive smell combining rot and the strong scent of the sea.


## Habitat and ecology

> Draugr normally rise in seas and aquatic areas that are either infused with necromantic energy or haunted by restless evil spirits. Most often these draugr remain near the place of their death and reanimation. Sometimes, entire crew that drowned with their [[Ship|ship]] reanimate crewing fearsome ghost ships, such draugr are a known menace in [[Shackles|the Shackles]] but can be found as far north as the freezing [[Ivory Sea]].


## Draugr captains

> Some draugr seem to possess additional powers, for instance, the ability to generate mists to conceal themselves and empower their [[Weapon|weapons]] to drain the life force of those they hit. These advanced draugr are called **draugr captains**. They can be distinguished from normal draugr by their burning red eyes and finer, though still tattered, clothes. Particularly powerful and experienced draugr are capable of enhancing their capabilities even further, often becoming [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]], [[Fighter|fighters]], and [[Rogue|rogues]].
