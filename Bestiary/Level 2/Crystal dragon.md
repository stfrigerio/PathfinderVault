> **Crystal dragons** are native to the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental]] [[Plane of Earth]]. They are one example of the [[Extraplanar|extraplanar]] [[True dragon|true dragons]] known as [[Primal dragon|primal dragons]].



## Appearance

> Crystal dragons sometimes appear as if they are scaled in precious [[Gems|gems]]. In other cases, they appear to have been carved from living crystal.


## Habitat and society

> Crystal dragons are solitary creatures. They are basically benevolent but are incredibly vain about their appearance, quick to take offence at slights both real and imagined.
> They prefer to establish their lairs next to deposits of precious minerals, and enjoy trading gems and [[Metal|metals]] for crafted items, especially [[Magic|magical]] ones. They often serve as self-appointed kings to nearby populations, who gain in security what they lose in freedom. Occasionally, a crystal dragon will challenge a nearby rival, but the resulting conflicts are usually fought by the two dragons personallyâ€”their vassals are not expected to get involved.
> Crystal dragons' domains often form into multiracial confederations comprised of several individual kingdoms, which are often home to races such as [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[Jann|jann]], [[Mephit|mephits]], [[Oread|oreads]], and exiled [[Shaitan|shaitans]]. Crystal dragons are fiercely protective of their domains, and provide the people living within them with freedom from the [[Slavery|slavery]] common within shaitan society.
> Relations with the Peerless Empire, the large shaitan empire on the Plane of Earth, are generally peaceful, as the shaitan are too busy with their war with the [[Efreeti|efreet]] to wish to antagonize the [[Dragon|dragons]].


## Abilities

> As with all true dragons, crystal dragons gain in power as they age. They have formidable physical abilities, and as they age they gain [[Spell|spell]]-like abilities and [[Sorcerer|sorcerous]] spellcasting.
> The crystalline scales of older dragons can potentially reflect magical rays back upon the [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]]. The very oldest dragons have scales of such scintillating colour that they can stun those who see them.
> A crystal dragon's breath creates a cone of sonic energy that is less physically damaging than those of other dragons.
