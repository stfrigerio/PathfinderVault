> A **hippogriff** is a generally aggressive flying creature with the hindquarters of a [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]] and the clawed forelegs, wings, and head of a large raptor [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird]].



## Description

> Most hippogriffs' feathers have the coloration of [[Hawk|hawks]] or [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Eagle|eagles]], while others have been bred to be all white or black. Their hindquarters are generally bay, chestnut, or gray, although palamino or pinto hippogriffs are not uncommon. Hippogriffs tend to be around 11 feet in length and weigh upwards of 1,500 pounds.


## Ecology

> Horses are ironically (because they are part-horse themselves) among hippogriff's preferred foods, which has led to speculation that they were intentionally designed this way via [[Magic|magic]].


## On Golarion

 
 A hippogriff-mounted [[Sable Company]] marine.
> The hippogriff is the mascot of [[Korvosa]] and they are employed as mounts for the city's [[Sable Company]], where they are stabled in an aerie located on the top three floors of [[Castle Korvosa]]'s [[Great Tower]]. The [[Galloping Ghost]] shop in Korvosa, and its leathersmith Patch, crafts and sells hippogriff tack and [[Barding|barding]].
> Wild hippogriffs, some of them escaped or stolen from the Sable Company's stables, also roost in parts of the city. Wild hippogriffs also live in and near the [[Kortos Mounts]] of the [[Isle of Kortos]].
> The [[Shriikirri-Quah]] [[Shoanti]] venerate hippogriffs as one of their totems.
> The [[Blakros Museum]]'s Hall of Legendary Beasts exhibit includes a taxidermied hippogriff.


## In the Great Beyond

> The [[Celestial creature|celestial]] hippogriff [[Cobblehoof]] serves [[Abadar]]. Priests of Abadar can also [[Summon|summon]] hippogriffs.
