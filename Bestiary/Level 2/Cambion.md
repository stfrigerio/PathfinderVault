> **Cambions** are the result of the unholy union between an [[Incubus|incubus]] and a [[Humanoid|humanoid]], [[Demon|non-demonic]] woman, but only if she spends her entire pregnancy in the [[Abyss]]. The energies of that [[Plane|plane]] infuse the foetus and cause her to always give birth to a male cambion instead of a [[Half-fiend|half-fiend]]. This causes them to be inherently different from all other demons: they are born on the Abyss as infants, rather than being created fully formed from evil [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]].
