> **Wargs**, sometimes spelt **worg**, are a large, intelligent and [[Evil|evil]] species of [[Wolf|wolf]]. Like their smaller cousins, they hunt in packs and can often be found in the company of other evil creatures.


## Society

> [[Winter wolf|Winter wolves]] are known to sometimes admit wargs into their packs, though only when food is plentiful, and even when they do, they still think of wargs as stupid and weak. Wargs always sit below winter wolves in the pack's pecking order, though if the pack also includes normal [[Wolf|wolves]] they are considered higher than them. Such mixed packs utilize wargs greater stealthiness by using them as scouts.


## On Golarion

> Violent [[Knight|knights]], who are comfortable with natural beasts, may be able to attract a warg as a mount.
> Wargs are known to roam across the [[Whistling Plains]] that lie east of [[Taldor]] and [[Galt]] and north of [[Qadira]].
