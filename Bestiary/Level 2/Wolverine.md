> **Wolverines** are aggressive, [[Weasel|weasel]]-like predators the size of [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Badger|badgers]]. They are solitary [[Animal|animals]] and preferentially forest-dwellers, and despite their size are able to successfully contend for food with larger hunters such as [[Bear|black bears]]. They are sacred to the [[Orc|orc]] deity [[Nulgreth]].



## Dire wolverines

> **Dire wolverines** are known to reach twelve feet in length, and are even more territorial and dangerous than the smaller kind. This often results in violent conflict when dire wolverines and [[Humanoid|humanoids]] settle in the same areas.


## On Golarion

> [[Fey]] wolverines are known to live in the [[Hoarwood Forest]] of [[Irrisen]].
