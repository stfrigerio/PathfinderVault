> **Psyche serpents** are [[Magical beast|magical beasts]] resembling purple-blue cobras with spiraling patterns on the undersides of their hoods. Keenly intelligent creatures, psyche  serpents find themselves irresistibly lured to cities, as urban life is often rife with the complex plots and intrigue which the sapient [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]] delight in taking part in and manipulating from behind the scenes with their [[Psychic|psychic]] abilities.
