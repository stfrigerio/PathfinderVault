  - name: "Head Bowl"
    desc: "  The depression atop a kappa's head is filled with water. Spilling, evaporating, or otherwise removing all of the water from the top of a kappa's head reduces all their Speeds to 5 feet until the basin is again filled with water. A kappa who becomes [[prone|prone]] must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or spill their water, and a kappa who becomes [[unconscious|unconscious]] automatically spills their water. If a kappa is grappled, [[restrained|restrained]], or [[stunned|stunned]], another creature can attempt to spill the water from their bowl by spending a single action, which has the [[attack]] and [[manipulate]] traits, to attempt an [[Athletics]] check against the kappa's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature spills the kappa's water."
abilities_bot:
  - name: "Pull Arm"
    desc: "⬻  The kappa pulls one of their arms, gaining 10-foot reach with that arm. The opposing arm shrinks to little more than a hand extending from their shell. The kappa can still use their shortened hand to hold things, but they can't use that hand to wield a shield or weapon. By spending a single action to pull their opposing arm, the kappa can return their arms to their original length."
