The choker must move the creature into a space adjacent to itself.

> **Chokers** are small, fast predators common in underground areas. In recent years, they have proven themselves to be quite adaptableâ€”despite their limited intelligenceâ€”by becoming an increasing nuisance in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]].



## Appearance

> Chokers are small [[Halfling|halfling]]-sized creatures, averaging 35 pounds (though larger man-sized specimens have been reported). Despite their size, they have extraordinarily long arms and legs. These limbs are boneless, and each ends in five tentacular fingers with an array of spines on the anterior. Chokers travel on their legs, or all-fours as the situation dictates, and have a gait that humanoids find disturbing and unnatural, due to their boneless limbs. Their wobbly locomotion has led to some commoners to question if the creatures have any skeleton at all.


## Habitat and ecology



> Chokers are found throughout the [[Inner Sea region]], both in [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]], and have also been reported in the far southern parts of Garund. They generally live underground, from the periphery of surface ruins to the secluded depths of [[Sekamina]]. From time to time, though, a choker will become curious about the world above, and make its way to the dark alleys and abandoned buildings of surface cities. Korvosa's [[Shingles]] areas are particularly notable for their large choker populations.
> Chokers are opportunistic hunters that wait in the darknessâ€”often perched up highâ€”for prey to happen by, and then strike with astonishing speed. In urban areas, they have been known to take prey from top-floor balconies and to reach down chimneys to ensnare unaware prey. Smaller prey and individuals tend to be their preferred target.


## Society

> Chokers are of limited intelligence and have little society of their own. Despite this, they are often fascinated by the products of more advanced cultures, and have been known to collect small tokens from their prey with which to festoon their lairs. Chokers are socially advanced enough to identify themselves and others with names, and occasionally form rudimentary friendships or alliances with less savory humans. Most chokers speak [[Darklands languagesUndercommon|Undercommon]], though some that have been born and raised in urban areas speak [[CommonCommon 28Taldane29|Taldane]].
> Their patron is the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Shivaska]], but they also worship the demon lord [[Shax]].
