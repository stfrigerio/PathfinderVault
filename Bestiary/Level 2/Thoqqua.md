> **Thoqquas** are semi-intelligent worm-like creatures native to the [[Plane of Fire|Elemental Plane of Fire]], specifically where it borders the [[Plane of Earth]].



## Appearance

> Thoqquas are thick worm-like creatures protected by red-hot, dense horny plates. Their body generates incredible heat, which constantly and visibly hisses from their joints, and allows them to melt most surfaces. Adult thoqquas are five feet long and weigh 200 pounds.


## Ecology

> Despite being [[Outsider|outsiders]] (and having no need to eat), thoqquas seek out ores and minerals to consume, smelt, and form into the thick plates of natural armor covering their bodies. Thoqquas are cantankerous, and will attack without warning if frustrated or startled. [[Humanoid]] settlements inside their territory are either chased away, or become regarded as property and guarded by the thoqquas.
> According to the [[Mephit|mephits]] (who seem to understand thoqquas' thought processes), thoqquas are descended from mountain-sized progenitors, servants of the [[Elemental lord|elemental lords]], who dug the first [[Volcano|volcanoes]] on young [[Planet|planets]], then retired there, and still heat those planets to this day.


## Relationships

> On the Plane of Fire, thoqquas are fierce enemies of the [[Magmin|magmins]] for reasons not fully understood.


## On the Material Plane

> Thoqquas are known to occasionally cross over to the [[Material Plane]], especially near areas of intense [[Volcano|volcanic]] activity, such as the [[Flume Warrens]] in the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Sekamina]].
