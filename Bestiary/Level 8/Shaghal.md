> **Shaghals** are beasts from [[Abaddon]] that serve as guards and sentries for [[Daemon|daemons]].



## Appearance

> A shaghal resembles a dark red-and-grey brawny [[Jackal|jackal]]. Ash and dust fall from their fur as they move, and they can cough forth clouds of this debris.


## Ecology

> Shaghals are less intelligent than [[Human|humans]], but enough to understand complex commands and work with others to hunt prey. They cannot speak, but understand [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] speech, and those that communicate with them via [[Telepathy|telepathy]] receive morose, fatalistic responses. Shaghals spread [[Diseases of Golarion|disease]], hunger, death and savagery wherever they go, and only wish to partake in ruin.


## Habitat

> Shaghals are most commonly found roaming in packs across the wastelands of Abaddon. They are sometimes [[Summon|summoned]] to [[Material Plane]] deserts, where they intimidate jackal packs into submission. Under command of a shaghal, jackals become significantly more confident, enough to take over settlements and oases to terrorise [[Humanoid|humanoids]]. Shaghals falsely believe that the [[Soul|souls]] of their victims are directly sent to Abaddon.
