> **Arboreal regents**, also known as **treants**, are massive, intelligent, sentient [[Arboreal|arboreals]] who tend to and protect an individual forest from the intrusions of the smaller races.



## Appearance

> Arboreal regents resemble [[Humanoid|humanoid]]-shaped trees and plants. They can grow to 30 feet in height and 2 feet in trunk diameter, weigh 4,500 pounds, and move slowly and deliberately.


## Ecology

> Arboreal regents are grown from a single green acorn about the size of a [[Human|human]] head. If planted, the seed will grow into a young arboreal regent after five years of careful tending.


## Habitat

> Arboreal regents live in and maintain a forest.


## Society

> Arboreals are long-lived creatures who take a long view of life and history, and rarely meddle in the affairs of short-lived [[Mortal|mortals]]. They tend to act only to protect themselves and the forests under their care from harm. Likewise, many are solitary outside of times of crisis, or meet in communal groups known as "groves" to share knowledge. The largest meetings occur only under the most serious of circumstances, when a region's groves meet for months at a time to plan action against an especially large threat. One such moot is believed to be taking place at the [[Century Root]] in [[Kyonin|Kyonins]] [[Fierani Forest]].
> Arboreal regents have the ability to imbue normal trees with a semblance of life, allowing them to uproot themselves, move about, and fight in the forest's defense. A normal arboreal regent can control only two such [[Awakened tree|awakened trees]] at a time, and the animated trees immediately return to their natural state if they move outside the arboreal regent's range of control, or if the controlling arboreal regent becomes incapacitated or dies. Arboreal regents can also cause great damage to inanimate objects or structures, a trait that is handy when they must destroy buildings that encroach upon their forests. Although they prefer to communicate in their own [[Arboreal language|slow long-winded language]], they generally can also speak [[Sylvan]], [[Common]], and can also communicate with any intelligent plant creature.
> Older regents and powerful arboreals have access to the [[Fungus|fungi]] that connect trees within a forest, and can use this connection to sense danger far from their current location.


### Nodrim

> Arboreal regents of the [[Verduran Forest]] brew a special beverage known as **nodrim** from fermented apples, wood chips, and clean water. Drinking an excess of the brew causes them to become intoxicated.


## On Golarion

> Arboreal regents can be found in the larger forests throughout Golarion, although the jungles of [[Garund]] are home to a related species known as the [[Tobongo|tobongo]]. Arboreal regents are known to be most prevalent in the Fierani Forest of Kyonin (where they are simply referred to as the **Fierani**), the [[Fangwood Forest]] of [[Nirmathas]], and the enormous Verduran Forest of central [[Avistan]]. The forests on the [[Isle of Terror]] in [[Lake Encarthan]] are home to a thoroughly [[Evil|evil]] species of arboreal regent warped by prolonged exposure the the foul energies of the [[Negative Energy Plane]].
> The [[Frost fir|frost firs]] are speculated by some scholars to be descended from arboreal regents that preferred evergreens and colder climates, although if so there is very little affection between the two species of sapient plants left in the present day.


### Tobongo

***Main article: [[Tobongo]]***
> The [[Mwangi Expanse]] is home to a variant arboreal regent known as a [[Tobongo|tobongo]]. Their [[Curse|curse]] can turn a victim into a tree. The hunched tobongo [[Dimari-Diji]] is possibly Golarion's oldest living creature.
