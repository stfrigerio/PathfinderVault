It can make up to four claw [[Strike|Strikes]] at any point during this movement, each against a different target within reach, and it deals an extra 1d6 (1d6) electricity damage with each [[Strike]]. These attacks count toward the behir's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after the behir makes all of its attacks. If the behir moves half its Speed or less during a Claw Storm, that movement doesn't trigger reactions. The behir can't use Claw Storm if it has a creature wrapped in its coils. At the end of Claw Storm, it drifts downward up to 60 feet to the ground, landing softly and taking no damage from the fall. If it descends further than 60 feet, it takes damage normally from the remaining fall."

> **Behirs** are enormous, multi-limbed [[Dragon|dragon-like]] creatures that inhabit dry mountain regions and fiercely defend their territories from all who dare intrude upon them.



## Appearance

> Behirs look like huge, sinewy, sleek reptiles covered in scales of various blue hues. These creatures can easily reach 40 feet in length and weigh up to 4,000 pounds, but are surprisingly agileâ€”easily able to outpace a [[Human|human]], they are even graceful climbers that can almost slither across the dry cliffs of their desert homes. A behir's six pairs of legs provide for fast and dexterous movement; when not in use, the behir curls its legs in against its body. The behir's head also sports an impressive set of curved horns.


## On Golarion


### Habitat and ecology

> Behirs inhabit the deserts of [[Golarion]] with a noticeable preference for lairing on mountains, cliffs, and hills surrounding or within the desert. Many behirs prefer high-elevation lairs with expansive views as they consider everything they can see from their lair to be their territory. Behirs are incredibly territorial, defending their hunting grounds with bestial force and their potent lightning breath.
> Despite their savage tendencies, behirs are more than simple animals. They are proud, powerful sentient creatures, though admittedly quite dim. It is possible to negotiate with a behir to enter or pass through its territory, but they tend to attack first and ask questions later. Anyone seeking to deal with a behir needs to make their offer quickly and impress the behir enough that it does not immediately attack.
> Much like the dragons they resemble, behirs are covetous and greedy. Some research suggests that due to their similar appearance, behirs may be somehow related to the conniving [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]]. True dragons are quick to dismiss this, citing the behir's relative lack of intelligence as clear proof that they are not related. This has created a great deal of enmity between behirs and dragons, and most behirs will attack a dragon with a level of ferocity impressive even for such an angry creature.
> The presence of a large number of behirs deters dragons from settling in an area. Many who live in places like the [[Brazen Peaks]] of northern [[Katapesh]] believe the many local behirs are responsible for the relatively small number of dragons within the mountain range.


### Behir caviar

> Behir caviar is considered a delicacy by Golarion's gourmands. The caviar is prepared by washing unfertilized serpentine behir eggs and soaking them in spiced vinegar to dissolve the shells. Afterwards, they are preserved in salt, chilled, and immediately served to the table. It usually plays the role of garnish or spread.
> There are rumors that those who import behir eggs into Absalom have some sort of arrangement with the creatures, paying some unknown price in exchange for their eggs. A clutch of raw behir eggs is worth around 25 gp, but once prepared its price increases to 100 gp or more to buy enough caviar to garnish six meals.


## On other worlds 


### Akiton

> Behirs are nearly as prevalent on the desert world of [[Akiton]] as they are on Golarion.


### Triaxus

> A stronger, silvery-white scaled, frost-resistant relative of the behir, the **frostcrawler** inhabits the world of [[Triaxus]].
