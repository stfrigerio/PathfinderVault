> **Marrowstone golems** are magical constructs built of a dangerous, radiant stone known as [[Lazurite|lazurite]] or marrowstone. They are thought to only be created by the intelligent [[Ghoul|ghouls]] who dwell in the [[Sekamina|Sekaminan]] city of [[Nemret Noktoria]], deep below the sands of northern [[Garund]].
