> The sinister **nabasu** is a roughly [[Human|human-sized]] [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bat-winged]] [[Demon|demon]] that can create [[Ghoul|ghouls]] out of those it kills. It is sometimes known as a **death demon** or a **glutton demon**.



## Associated sin

> Nabasus are associated with the sin of gluttony (particularly cannibalism).


## Appearance

> A nabasu resembles a lanky, scaled [[Humanoid|humanoid]] with large, bat-like wings. It has prominent teeth and claws.


## Habitat and society

> Nabasus are formed from the [[Soul|souls]] of [[Evil|evil]] gluttons, especially cannibals and those who eat [[Undead|undead]] flesh. Unusually for a demon, it is birthed on the [[Material Plane]] rather than the [[Abyss]]. It lives a solitary life, and its goal is to transform as many living humanoids into [[Ghoul|ghouls]] as it can. It gains in power for each ghoul it creates, and when it has created enough ghouls (the number required varies for each individual, but is never more than 20) it grows in size and is transported back to the Abyss. There they continue to grow, ultimately becoming fearsome [[Vrolikai|vrolikai]] demons.
> Nabasus worship the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Xoveron]] as their patron.


## Abilities

> A nabasu has a number of magical abilities for weakening or immobilising foes, and is capable of dealing nasty wounds with its teeth and clawsâ€”especially against targets that have let down their guard. Its most potent ability, however, is its deadly gaze, which drains the life force from living creatures and can kill weaker victims. Any living humanoid killed by the gaze immediately transforms into a ghoul that the nabasu that created them can command.


## Environment

> Lesser nabasus are found on [[Golarion]], while the successful ones return to the Abyss.
> They are popular minions for those who think they can control them, as they can grow in power and provide further ghoul minions.


> [[Paizo]] published a sourcebook about demons called *[[Demons Revisited]]* which includes a full chapter about nabasu demons.
