> When a powerful [[Mortal|mortal]] dreamer wakes from a particularly vivid dream, part of their consciousness sometimes escapes from its [[Dreamscape|dreamscape]] and lingers on the [[Ethereal Plane]] as an **animate dream**. Independent creatures in their own right, these animate dreams come to [[Golarion]] to feed on the strong emotions of mortals. If the mortals are asleep and dreaming while they are experiencing these emotions, the animate dream's nourishment increases.


## Appearance

> As animate dreams are the product of their dreamer's sleeping mind, their appearances vary wildly. Some animate dreams are known to appear as:

> - A brightly colored creature resembling an amalgamation of [[Goat|goat]] and [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]] standing upright, with a long forked tongue, a [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Rat|rat]]-like tail, and unnaturally colored fur.
> - A purple-skinned [[Humanoid|humanoid]] whose lipless, fang-filled grin stretches from ear to ear beneath its blazing red eyes, with long black hair that floats as if it were underwater and writhing tentacles in place of fingers.
> - A gaunt man in gray robes with long black hair and a beard, unusual only in that the edges of his robes fray into smoke upon close inspection.
