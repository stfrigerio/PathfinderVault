> Of all the beasts that populate the wilderness, few are as feared as the **bulette**. Known sometimes as **landsharks**, bulettes are sleek predators who move as fluidly through earth as those primeval eating machines move through water.



## Ecology and habitat

> Bulettes possess insatiable hunger and view anything that moves as food. They hunt constantly, and when their attention turns to new hunting grounds they feed until nothing remains. They are the stuff of nightmares, the bane of the wildernessâ€”a brutal, savage monster whose ferocious majesty was not evolved, but intentionally crafted.
> They claim territories of up to 500 square miles and prey freely on anything within it during its patrols, to such a point that entire settlements might be destroyed to sate their hunger. They are solitary creatures who avoid other bulettes unless seeking a mate, with which they bond for life, and raise any offspring they produce only until they have taught it to hunt, at which point they drive their kin away.


### Origins

> The first bulettes were designed as guardians for a [[Wizard|wizard]] whose identity is lost in time, but is theorized to have been an [[Elf|elf]] because bulettes dislike the taste of their flesh. Many wizards have staked a claim to inventing the beasts, but the means of creating them and their purpose are unknown.


## On Golarion

![[Dungeon_Denizens_Revisited_cover.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Amiri]], [[Harsk]], and [[Sajan]] evade a rampaging bulette.
> Bulettes can be found throughout the [[Inner Sea region]] as far north as the [[Worldwound]], where they eat both humans and [[Demon|demons]]. Their range also extends east into [[Tian Xia]] where they are particularly prevalent in the remotest reaches of the [[Shaguang|Shaguang Desert]]. They are most common in [[Rahadoum]], [[Thuvia]], [[Katapesh]], [[Nex]], [[Geb's Rest]], and [[Varisia|Varisias]] [[Storval Plateau]]. Bulettes are also found to the east of the Inner Sea region across the vast [[Whistling Plains]] that lie to the east of [[Taldor]] and [[Galt]] and to the north of [[Qadira]].
> Bulettes are not found in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] for reasons unknown, especially since the area is sparsely populated and bulettes are known to hunt in swamps and marshlands. They are also less-commonly found along the heavily populated areas of the north and eastern shores of the [[Inner Sea]].
> The [[Hold of Belkzen]] is home to the [[Juggerloathe]], a monstrous bulette sired by [[Yethazmari]], the herald of [[Lamashtu]], from a normal, if freakishly large, bulette. The creature resembles a towering, red-skinned bulette with a cobra's body for a tail.
> Bulettes are often tamed by [[Kobold|kobolds]] to aid in tunneling and mining, as well as to serve as powerful attack creatures in raids on enemy settlements. These bulettes are primarily controlled through [[Magic|magic]], although some are raised from the egg and trained to serve the kobold tribe.
