> The gigantic marine predators known as **tylosauruses** are not true [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaurs]], but have several similarities to them. They are adapted to life in the ocean, with flippers instead of legs and a long, [[Fish|fish-like]] tail. However, they are able to move clumsily on land if necessary.
> They hunt sea creatures, swallowing smaller prey whole and relying on their powerful teeth to incapacitate larger creatures. They can threaten shipping as they sometimes assume passing [[Ship|ships]] are some new type of [[Whale|whale]].
> A typical specimen is 50 feet long and weighs 30,000 pounds.


## On Golarion

> Tylosauruses live in the vast central band of the [[Okaiyo Ocean]] along with other huge sea predators. Tylosauruses prowl the surface layers of the ocean and are, as above, a threat to shipping in this ocean.
