Each brain controls one of the troll's arms, but both can move the legs. Any ability that would sever a two-headed troll's head (such as the vorpal weapon property) doesn't cause the two-headed troll to die if they still have their other head, but does cause them to lose the turns, actions, and reactions of the severed head.

> **Two-headed trolls** are a savage breed of [[Troll|troll]] known for its dual heads and minds. They are descended from [[Ettin|ettins]].



## Appearance

> A two-headed troll's most notable difference from other trolls is that it possesses two heads instead of one. Two-headed trolls also walk upright instead of adopting the hunched-over posture of other troll breeds, a holdover from their ettin ancestors.


## Ecology

> A two-headed troll's heads possess independent minds and personalities. Each head has control of the arm on its side, and the two share control of the legs. Two-headed trolls are carnivores, and enjoy eating creatures small enough to consume in one bite, which they refer to as "nibbles".


## In culture

> The ravenous appetites of two-headed trolls have a fearsome reputation in the [[Inner Sea region]]. In particular, parents often invoke the creatures to cow misbehaving children, warning that if they do not obey instructions or do their chores a two-headed troll will come and devour them.
