> **Brain collectors**, or **neh-thalggus** as they call themselves, are an alien race engineered to serve as scouts by the [[Dominion of the Black]], a malevolent coalition of aliens from outside [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Solar system|solar system]].



## Appearance

> A brain collector is shaped like a tailless [[Scorpion|scorpion]] covered in transparent pulsing blisters filled with the brains they have collected. Their eyes peer forth from the joints of their legs.


## Ecology

> A brain collector collects the brains of intelligent creatures it killsâ€”typically [[Humanoid|humanoids]]â€”and stores them in reddish blisters on its back. Although they are carnivorous, brain collectors do not eat brains; they prefer to collect them to increase their intellect, or for analysis and [[Occult magic|occult]] vessels. These collected brains increase cognitive and [[Magic|magical]] abilities. After having collected enough brains and absorbed a critical mass of thoughts and memories from them, a brain collector undergoes a metamorphosis into a [[Yah-thelgaad|yah-thelgaad]].


## Habitat

> On planets, brain collectors take over caves or abandoned buildings and line them with a network of flesh, allowing them to control devices from anywhere within the lair.


## Society

> Brain collectors view other lifeforms as harvestable resources, even when those lifeforms worship them as [[Deity|gods]]. They also do not worship any named divinities, instead venerating the primordial forces of space itself.
> They communicate [[Telepathy|telepathically]], speak many languages, and practice [[Occult magic|occult magic]].


### Technology

> Brain collectors have comparable [[Technology|technology]] to other starfaring races, but theirs differs by being primarily organic and using little [[Metal|metal]]. Sometimes, components for their technology are whole bioengineered creatures, but more often than not they come from creatures that are bred simply to be butchered for their organs. For this reason, brain collector technology often retains the semblance of life, throbbing with biological sounds, reacting when used properly or not, and being healed by [[Positive energy|positive energy]].
> The few manually controlled brain collector devices are done so by poking and massaging certain pressure points. More often, they directly attach to the user's nervous system through the skin, allowing them to draw power from the user, who can control them as easily as if they were part of their body.
> Brain collectors' [[Spaceship|spaceships]] are living, tentacled creatures supported by a skeleton made out of both metallic and organic bones whose living processes produce fuel and serve as life support. Within each ship is a self-contained ecosystem that provides food and experimental material. When brain collectors need to land on a [[Planet|planet]], their ship produces drop pods via budding, which decompose once they are on the surface.
> While brain collectors rarely need equipment for themselves due to their natural [[Weapon|weapons]] and magic, they still produce it for their minions. Although made out of flesh and bone, these items are functionally similar to more conventional counterparts.


## On other worlds

> Brain collectors can be found on any of the [[Planet|worlds]] of the solar system populated by humanoids.
