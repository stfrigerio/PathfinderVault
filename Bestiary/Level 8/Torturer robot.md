## Appearance

> A torturer robot is a hovering metallic sphere studded with spinning blades, long needles and crystal-tipped rods, surrounded by a protective force field.


## Ecology

> Torturer robots administer pain with their [[Nanite|nanites]] and [[Laser|laser]] while repeating questions, their heuristic programming analysing the truth and completeness of responses. As their job requires knowledge of [[Human|human]] [[Anatomy|anatomy]] and the capacity to revive a dying patient, they are also used as [[Medicine|field medics]] and [[Surgery|surgeons]].
