> The **destrachan** is an aberrant subterranean predator. Despite its bestial appearance, it is both intelligent and cruel.



## Appearance

> A destrachan is a bipedal reptilian creature. Its tube-shaped head has no eyes, complex frilled ears, and a great circular mouth ringed with numerous rows of teeth like a lamprey's.


## Abilities

> Lacking eyes, a destrachan is completely blind, but thanks to its incredibly sensitive ears it can effectively "see" everything within a hundred feet. Destrachans can emit powerful waves of sound from their mouths that can destroy objects and inflict agonizing pain on living creatures. Destrachans themselves are resistant to sonic attacks, including those of other destrachans.


## Habitat & Society

> Destrachans live underground in caves, where they hunt in packs of up to five and feed on both live prey and carrion. Though they cannot speak humanoid tongues, they are quite intelligent and can understand spoken language; they communicate amongst themselves with clicks, shrieks, and whistles. Destrachans are cruel and sadistic, taking pleasure from their victims' suffering.
> Destrachans and [[Xill|xills]] are mortal enemies.


## Destrachans on Golarion

> Destrachans have been encountered in [[Varisia]] in the environs of [[Guiltspur]] and in the [[Forest of Spirits]] in [[Tian Xia]].


## Destrachans on Other Worlds

> Destrachans exist on the planet [[Triaxus]], but are rare. The [[White dragon|white dragon]] warlord [[Yrax]] created a [[Half-dragon|half-dragon]] destrachan "son", Iantor, as his heir.
