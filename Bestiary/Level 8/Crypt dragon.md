> **Crypt dragons** are the species of [[Planar dragon|planar dragons]] native to the [[Boneyard]].


## Appearance

> Crypt dragons have scales the colour of weathered bone, and a taut hide stretched painfully over its emaciated form.


## Ecology

> Crypt dragons emerge from nests of skulls and gravestones in the Boneyard, and afterwards make their way to the [[Inner Plane|Inner Planes]] where they establish their lairs and personal realms. They patrol the Inner Planes, ever vigilant for transgressions against the dead or the passage of [[Soul|souls]] to the afterlife, and act as protectors of the dead, their possessions and their souls. If a particular souls gains special favor with the dragon watching over it, its warden may go as far as escorting it through the [[Astral Plane]] and representing it at [[Pharasma]]'s court.
