> The **onidoshi**, also known as **ogre mages**, are the most common sort of [[Oni|oni]]â€”a [[Fiendish|fiendish]] spirit cloaked in living flesh, manifested in the form of an [[Ogre|ogre]]. Onidoshi are often found as leaders of ogre tribes, while others become lone marauders who hold whole villages as hostages, demanding regular tributes in the form of [[Gold|gold]], food, or maidens.



## Appearance

![[Ninjas_and_ogre_mage.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Ninja|Ninjas]] accompany an onidoshi.
> Onidoshi closely resemble ogres, but of a more noble and intelligent mien. They possess jagged tusks and gleaming eyes. An onidoshi typically wears beautiful, ornate [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]].


## Abilities

> Like all oni, onidoshi have the powers of regeneration and shapeshifting. As befits their name, they also have a suite of [[Magic|magical]] abilities. Despite their lack of wings, onidoshi can fly unaided.


## Ecology

> Onidoshi originated in [[Tian Xia]], but have also become common in the [[Inner Sea region]], where they are the best-known race of oni. The lusts of onidoshi are responsible for small pockets of [[Oni-spawn|oni-spawn]] [[Tiefling|tieflings]] in both the [[Hold of Belkzen]] and [[Cheliax]] where they have historically served as mercenaries.
