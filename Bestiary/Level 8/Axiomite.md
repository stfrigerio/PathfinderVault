> **Axiomites** (pronounced AK-see-oh-mite) are creatures of pure [[Law|law]], living incarnations of the [[Godmind]] that brought the Eternal City of [[Axis]] into existence. They are Axis' first inhabitants, and serve as the lords, caretakers, and architects of the city. According to [[Aeon|aeons]] as part of the Convergence, axiomites are themselves aeons and part of the [[Monad]], and represent a group that rebelled against the Monad as part of a long-forgotten cycle.



## Appearance

> The true form of axiomites is that of glowing clouds of [[Gold|golden]], crystalline dust. The clouds move and contort on their own accord, temporarily congealing into twisting lines of [[Mathematics|mathematical]] symbols and complex tangles of equations. Each axiomite is actually an [[Immortal|immortal]] [[Construct|construct]] of living, intelligent mathematics approximating a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] shape.
> However, axiomites usually take a variety of outward forms of [[Metal|metallic]], idealised, perfect humanoids of all descriptions. Non-humanoid axiomites also exist, but are rarely seen and usually stay in the depths of Axis. Their true forms can be seen briefly whenever axiomites move or perform any complex actions.


## Ecology

> Axiomites claim that they are the mathematical laws of reality made manifest in order to understand itself. The first axiomites were created from arithmetic dust by the Threefold Pillars of the Axiomite Godmind, before the advent of [[Mortality|mortal life]]. These ancient axiomites are known as **hierarchs**, and take the most alien forms among their race.
> New axiomites, like many [[Outsider|outsiders]], are created from the [[Soul|souls]] of [[Mortal|mortals]] who embodied the ideals of [[Law|law]] and [[Neutral|impartiality]]â€”such as architects, crafters, mathematicians, and [[Philosophy|philosophers]]â€”and found their way to Axis. When asked, axiomites claim that this is an adjustment to the changing laws that govern all existence, as [[Demon|demons]], [[Devil|devils]], and all sorts of other outsiders reproduce using mortal souls, as do the axiomites.
> The actual transformation of a soul into an axiomite is a mysterious process. The soul experiences a strong call towards one of the axiomite constructions (axiomites describe this as "the call of the Godmind" or "answering the resonance"). Each of these structures is related to a single class of laws with each construction attracting souls with similar interests. Once a soul reaches one of these axiomites, they touch it, disappearing within for several days; when they emerge, they are an axiomite.


## Habitat

> The only place axiomites call home is the Perfect City of Axis. They rarely leave their home, but some brave axiomites can be found elsewhere either trying to understand some fundamental laws of the [[Great Beyond]], proselytise the value of order, fight [[Chaos|chaos]], or expand the borders of Axis. The ecology of the axiomites is bizarre and could exist only in the [[Outer Planes]]. According to their records, axiomites were the first creatures to inhabit the city of Axis.
> Outside of Axis, axiomites can be found in the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]], [[Heaven]], [[Hell]], the [[Boneyard]], and the domains of [[Law|lawful]] [[Deity|deities]], keeping embassies and working with fellow researchers. They also maintain a presence at the Spire of Golden Concordance in [[Nirvana]], where they study [[Agathion|agathions]]' history and methods of cooperation. On the [[Material Plane]], axiomites guide the advancement of lawful cultures.
> Axiomites maintain numerous [[Laboratory|laboratories]] hidden across the multiverse, where they conduct dangerous research. One of the most notable of such black sites is Liracaenia's Cradle, a [[Demiplane|demiplane]] in the [[Astral Plane]].


## Society


### The Godmind of Axis

***Main article: [[Godmind]]***
> Axiomite society is inwardly focused and divided into three groups, mirroring the Threefold Pillars of Axis: Knowledge, Enforcement, and Administration. The First Pillar focuses on researching the history and laws of the [[Plane|planes]] beyond Axis and the multiverse itself; the Second Pillar is tasked with building and maintaining the axiomites' servitors, an army of [[Inevitable|inevitables]]; the Third Pillar occupies itself with managing Axis and the city's diplomatic relations. Axiomites of the Second Pillar are expansionist, but do this solely due to their wish to regulate the multiverse.
> Despite its three separate focuses, axiomite society moves with a single purpose. The race is collectively ruled by the Godmind of Axis, which is formally known as Transcendental Council of the Defined Infinite. Despite its name, the Godmind is not a [[Deity|deity]], or a singular hive-mind entity. It is instead a composite of the greatest axiomite minds from each of the three focuses of their society. Referring to axiomites collectively is equatable to referring to the Godmind, and their actions are the Godmind's.


### Relationships

> A council of [[Pleroma aeon|pleroma aeons]] recently revealed that axiomites were prodigal aeons that broke free from the Monad, an aeon [[Demigod|demigod]] that claims to represent the underpinning of all realities, in order to pursue acts of creation. This reassociation of axiomites as aeons is part of a cycle the aeon council calls the "Convergence". Most axiomites were swayed by these aeons' explanation of how the axiomite language, [[Utopian]], itself is a melding of aeon envisioning and mathematical expression. However, some rejected the Convergence, and the aeon response has ranged from disregard to bargaining, or even destruction.
> Inevitables are by far the most prominent of the axiomites' servitors. Additionally, axiomites also employ [[Scrivenite|scrivenites]] as preservers of knowledge and [[Axial monitor|Axial monitors]] as a police force. [[Aphorite|Aphorites]], despite also being axiomite creations, are less servants and more colleagues created by the Godmind as a way to better understand mortals. The most powerful of such creations are [[Apkallu|apkallus]], the living *sphere of annihilation* known as the *Ghost of Departed Quantities*, inevitables that are worn as [[Armour|armour]] by axiomite generals, and other strange things that are both and neither inevitable and axiomite, but are amalgamations of metal and mathematics.
> Axiomites maintain strong alliances with [[Archon|archons]] and [[Devil|devils]], and often cooperate with them against [[Protean|proteans]] and [[Demon|demons]]. They hold a deep, mutual respect with [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]] and [[Mercane|mercanes]]. Axiomites tolerate, but mostly ignore, the presence of Axis's curious [[Gishvit|gishvits]]. They have increasingly sought to collaborate with the [[Riftwardens]], but have difficulty working alongside its chaotic members.
> Axiomites find it hard to interact with other beings, especially mortals; they operate on a geological timescale, often fail to grasp that different circumstances require different solutions, and their methods tend to be blunt, extreme, and lacking in nuance. Their actions are guided by cold pragmatism alone, devoid of any benevolence or malice.
> Accustomed to having loyal inevitable servants and reluctant to directly act, they usually hire [[Adventurer|adventurers]] as agents, which they see as operating according to their own law. Despite the difficulties of interaction between axiomites and their hirelings, they always follow their bargains to the letter.
> Some axiomites discover impossible calculations that are neither true nor false and reveal some terrible realities that lie beyond known creation. Agents of [[Norgorber]] often lure them to [[Duskfathom]] with the promise of clearing their memories, but instead transform them into [[Graveknight|graveknights]] as their despair is exacerbated, flesh melted away, and soulstuff twisted into [[Negative energy|negative energy]] to leave behind only a core of hateful mathematics.


## On Golarion

> Throughout most of his reign over [[Thassilon]], axiomites worked for [[Xin|Emperor Xin]] as aides, before the [[Runelords|runelords]] took over and corrupted the empire.
