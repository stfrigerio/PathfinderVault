> A **daughter of Urgathoa** is an adopted child of the Pallid Princess, the goddess [[Urgathoa]] herself. Given new purpose at the moment of death, these [[Undead|undead]] creatures of warped flesh and bone continue to serve their new mother as they did in life.



## Description

> Though bearing some resemblance to the women they once were, it is impossible not to recognize daughters of Urgathoa for the monsters they have become. Their bodies are warped and twisted, and are both supported and propelled by a sinuous tentacle formed from bodily tissues and excretions. All daughters of Urgathoa possess a hand that has increased in both size and lethality to become a great clawâ€”an effective weapon for the undead creature. Although their individual appearances vary wildly, most are much larger than they were in life, often standing nearly 15 feet in height and weighing more than 600 pounds.
> No two daughters look alike, as the goddess' transformation is unique to each individual. Each maintains certain aspects of their mortal appearance, although such things as distinctive clothes or jewelry are mimicked in flesh and bone.
> Daughters of Urgathoa possess formidable abilities, retaining a number of those they had in life, in addition to those gained from their transformation. They can spread [[Disease|disease]] with a simple touch, and the blessings of the Pallid Princess follow wherever they go.


## Ecology

> Considered the most desired position by the [[UrgathoaChurch of Urgathoa|church of Urgathoa]], only the most devoted priestesses are transformed into daughters of Urgathoa upon their deaths. These undead creatures continue to serve their goddess, often leading cults of increasing size and strength as new followers flock together to follow one of Urgathoa's chosen. Each daughter quickly impacts the world around them, whether it is in the creation of virulent diseases, the creation of undead hordes to attack the living, the creation of evil [[Artifact|artifacts]], or simply by inspiring greater and more destructive fervor among the followers of Lady Despair.
