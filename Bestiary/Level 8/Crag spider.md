> **Crag spiders** are not especially unique simply for being huge arachnids. What makes them mentionable is the incredible altitudes at which they can comfortably live.



## Appearance

> This creature looks like a huge chitinous spider with a jagged, alien-looking exoskeleton. Its eight legs each have claws which are uses to dig into the mountainside. Its head has an unusual appearance with the standard eight eyes of the spider above an alien mouth filled with tendrils.


## Habitat & Ecology

> Crag spiders dwell on some of the highest mountains in [[Golarion]] and are particularly common in the [[Kodar Mountains]]. It is believed that they were originally created by [[Runelord|runelord]] [[Karzoug]] to serve as steeds for his loyal giant servants.


## Abilities

Tether
A crag spider can attach itself to a nearby rock to secure itself while it climbs.
Web
Crag spiders use their webs to ensnare prey much like other spiders.
