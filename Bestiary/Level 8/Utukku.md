> **Utukkus** are a race of shapechanging [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] that build cults to remove sinful [[Soul|souls]] from the cycle of [[Mortal|mortal]] life.



## Appearance

> In its true form, an utukku looks like a 7-foot-tall, 200-pound-heavy scaled [[Humanoid|humanoid]] with a single eye where a face should be, surrounded by wriggling tendrils. Its arms are sucker-tipped tentacles.


## Abilities

> When an utukku attacks a humanoid, it siphons away some of the victim's humanity, leaving it warped and deformed. It can [[False divine magic|falsely]] replicate the granted powers of two [[Domain|domains]] as if it were a [[Cleric|cleric]].


## Society

> An utukku teaches its followers that they will be rewarded not via transformation into an [[Outsider|outsider]], but by assimilation into the [[Great Beyond]] itself. After death and [[Pharasma|Pharasmas]] judgement, the souls of an utukku's cultists are converted into [[Quintessence|quintessence]] that then merges with and bolsters the [[Abyss]] instead of becoming [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]], denying the [[Demon|demons]] a soul that they can use to create more of their kind.
> Some utukkus are employed by [[Thulgant|thulgants]] to collect preserved victims from the [[Material Plane]] or other Abyssal realms.
