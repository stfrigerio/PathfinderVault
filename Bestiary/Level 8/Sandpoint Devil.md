> A thing of legend, the **Sandpoint Devil** is a horrific beast said to stalk the western coast of [[Varisia]] near the town of [[Sandpoint]]. Rumored to have been birthed by a woman cursed by [[Lamashtu]], the Sandpoint Devil is one of the most famous local legends, including that it steals children from windows left open. Despite long-standing rewards for its capture, it has never been caught. When hunters and travelers go missing along the [[Lost Coast]], chances are you'll hear tell that the Sandpoint Devil got them.



## Appearance

> Descriptions of the creature vary widely due to the fact that it only appears on nights when thick fog rolls in from the [[Varisian Gulf]]. It is generally thought to look like a nearly skeletal [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]] with [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bat]] wings, stunted forelegs, a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Lizard|lizard]]-like tail and a jaw filled with sharp teeth. Its powerful hind legs allow it to walk upright like a [[Humanoid|humanoid]].


## Abilities

> The Sandpoint Devil's maddening scream has been known to strike terror into even the stoutest of hearts. It can also exhale large gouts of sulfur-tainted fire, burning all who would dare harm it.


## Ecology and habitat

> The Sandpoint Devil makes its home at the bottom of the [[Pit Sandpoint hinterlands|Pit]] within [[Devil's Platter|Devils Platter]] on [[Varisia|Varisias]] Lost Coast. Judging from the charred and half-eaten carcasses it leaves behind, it prefers the taste of meat. Although it had been known to attack people, it generally restricts itself to hunting wild game, or devouring helpless livestock, much to the consternation of local farmers.
> Typical signs of the Sandpoint Devil's passing include hoofprints smelling of brimstone in odd places. Rumors also suggest the Sandpoint Devil is not a unique creature.
