> A **Liavaran dreamer**, or simply **dreamer**, is a feral descendant of [[Brethedan]] colonists on the gas giant [[Planet|planet]] [[Liavara]], the eighth planet in [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Solar system|solar system]]. "Dreamer" is derived from a rough translation of the Brethedan term for them.



## Appearance

> A dreamer is a tentacled, amorphous, jellyfish-like floating creature with a yellow body.


## Abilities

> Dreamers draw their name from the trance-like state they inhabit while feeding from [[Ley line|ley lines]]. Others who attempt [[Telepathic|telepathic]] communication are also lulled into a similar reverie. When awakened from this state, dreamers become fiercely violent for about a minute's time before tiring out.


## Ecology

> Dreamers are attuned to ley lines, and Liavara is dense with them. Their more conscious Brethedan cousins respectfully leave them to feed on Liavara, and some scholars believe Brethedans view Liavaran dreamers as more enlightened.


## Society

> Liavaran dreamers are more solitary and less responsive, active, or [[Technologically|technologically]] adept as their Brethedan counterparts. However, they do serve as stewards of Liavara's wildlife.
