> The **angazhanis** or **high girallons**, are larger, more intelligent, and far more dangerous than standard [[Girallon|girallons]].



## Appearance

> Angazhanis are massive, four-armed albino [[Ape|apes]], reaching nine feet in height and often weighing 1,000 pounds. They sometimes dress in hides and braid bone trophies into their fur.


## Habitat and society

> It is not clear whether angazhanis are a natural creature, or a creation of some [[Evil|evil]] power. In any event, they are thoroughly evil and worship the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Angazhan]]. They prefer to live in remote jungles, typically inhabiting the ruins of cities built by other creatures. They often rule as priest-kings over tribes of lesser apes (or even, on occasion, humanoid cultists), collecting tribute from their minions.


## Abilities

> The most dangerous thing about them is their intelligence—they are at least as intelligent as an average [[Human|human]]. They use tools, including [[Weapon|weapons]] and hide armour.


## On Golarion

> They are typically found in the jungles of the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. The largest concentration was in [[Usaro]], where approximately 450 angazhanis served the [[Gorilla King]]. After the death of the Gorilla King, the angazhanis have fallen into infighting, though a [[Mwangi]] warrior named Shosenbe is attempting to reunite the creatures.
