> **Zhen worms** (pronounced ZHEN-wurms) are insects that dwell in warm and wet environments, but frequently migrate to locations with geothermic hot springs and mud pots such as [[Darkmoon Vale]] in [[Andoran]], [[Gorum Pots]] of [[Numeria]], and Teratze in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. Most are just over an inch in diameter, but given perfect conditions, can grow up to 10 feet in length. No matter the size, zhen worms carry a series of orange bands along their lengths, which allow them to detect tremors and vibrations, used to sense the approach of prey. This ability is muffled by cold or rock-filled earth. The appetite of the worms include rodents, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Lizard|lizards]], and slow birds. They don't have mouths, but absorb nutrients through the tiny holes along their sides, breaking down organic matter via a mildly acidic slime that they constantly secrete from their bodies.
> The slime from the zhen worm's bodyâ€”called zhen distillateâ€”can be used to preserve meat long-term although this meat will have to be well-washed before being prepared to eat.
