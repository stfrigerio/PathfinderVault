    desc: "⭓ __Trigger__ The ghaele ends its turn while unable to act or attempts a greatsword [[Strike]] that would take a circumstance or status penalty. __Effect__  A ghaele's blade is implacable in the pursuit of freedom, and its energies can overpower any effect that would interfere with its swordplay. The ghaele attempts to counteract each effect that prevents it from making a greatsword [[Strike]], gives it a penalty to its greatsword [[Strike]], or prevents it from acting. The ghaele can use this ability even if it's otherwise unable to act."

> Of all the [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azatas]], **ghaeles**—also known as **crusader azatas**—are considered to be the most [[Knight|knight]]-like. They spend their time hunting down fearsome foes like foul [[Undead|undead]], [[Evil|evil]] [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]], and even mighty [[Dragon|dragons]]. Ghaeles appear like idealised knights of either [[Human|human]] or [[Elf|elven]] origin, and are quick with a smile but are just as quick to strike down any they perceive as wicked.
> They are often companions of more powerful [[Prydanu|prydanu]] azatas, who view ghaeles as great companions in their righteous crusades against tyranny. Many share the beliefs of [[Cayden Cailean]], and might fight alongside [[Mortal|mortals]] in order to aid and teach them how to battle fiends.
