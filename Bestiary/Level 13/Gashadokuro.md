## On Golarion

> A gashadokuro exists within [[Taldor|Taldors]] [[Border Wood]], where it formed when a company of soldiers became trapped within a blocked-off ravine and collectively starved to death. Luckily for the other inhabitants of the forest, the gashadokuro currently remains trapped within the ravine where it was created.
