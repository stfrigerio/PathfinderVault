> The **Black Rider**, or **Black Midnight**, is one of [[Baba Yaga's Riders|Baba Yagas Riders]], the heralds who proceed the [[Baba Yaga|Witch Queen]] to [[Irrisen]] so they they may judge the inhabitants of that snowy realm. The Black Rider performs his duty only under the cover of night, leaving the daylight hours to his companions, the [[Red Rider|Red]] and the [[White Rider]]. Baba Yaga refers to this rider, whose mount is fierce and black, as 'My Dark Midnight',  while the [[Jadwiga]] call him just 'Night'.
