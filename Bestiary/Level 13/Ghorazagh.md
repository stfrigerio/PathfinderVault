> The **ghorazagh** or **gore weavers** of deep [[Orv]] are among the most bizarre and horrifying creatures imaginable. These abominations retreated to their vault refuge of Orlvagras in the [[Darklands]] far below [[Casmaron]] in an ancient time when the surface of Golarion was scoured by a cataclysm. Since the death of [[Aroden]], they have begun to explore the upper regions of the Darklands to feast upon [[Charda|charda]], ghouls, and [[Drow|drow]], and expand their colonies upwards.


## Appearance

> A gore weaver appears as a roughly spherical crustacean floating in mid-air with terrible claws and tentacles hanging from their midsection. The creatures entangle prey with their tentacles, and drain the blood and flesh from their prey once they attach.


## Habitat and ecology

> The gore weavers can digest nearly any type of organic material and metabolize it in their five tube-like stomachs, but they cannot digest blood. Instead, they store blood in special sac-like organs attached to their leech-like tentacles.
> Ghorazaghs secrete eldritch enzymes that preserve and altering the effects of this blood. They can spray it onto their prey to slow or paralyze them (or remove those effects), or congeal the blood into the hard, scabrous material with which they build the hives and tunnels that fill their domain. These dreadful fastnesses include weird crystal- and vein-like structures of congealed blood, through which modified blood is pumped. This enzymatically modified blood allows the gore weavers to replenish their blood sacs and transmit unique chemical messages to each other and the rest of the hive.
> In their native vaults, the gore weavers farm blood worms, but they see all things as food and are eager to savor the taste of the screaming sentient beings above.
> Every gore weaver hive is organized as a collective, analogous to an ant colony or bee hive. The hive obeys the commands of a single gore weaver hive lord, a bloated monstrosity of blood-sucking brain tissue. Specialized and armored brood guards defend the hive, while ordinary gore weavers serve as drones to hunt, explore, and taste and dissect interesting prey.
