> The **titanoboa** is an immense,  non-[[Venom|venomous]], swamp-dwelling [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake]]. Titanoboas are ambush predators, and their colouration, typically grey-green and brown, serves to camouflage them effectively in their homes. A titanoboa is 45 feet long and weighs 2,500 pounds.
