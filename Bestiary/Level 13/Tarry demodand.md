> **Tarry demodands** are the line infantry in the legions of [[Demodand|demodands]].


## Appearance

> Tarry demodands are lithe and lean compared to other demodands, standing seven feet tall and weighing 400 pounds. Despite this, all tarry demodands are strong and agile. Although their [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bat]]-like wings appear tattered, they can still fly. Their skin is jet black and they lack the terrific claws of the greater demodands. Enemy [[Weapon|weapons]] striking tarry demodands might get stuck on the sticky ooze dripping from their claws.


## Ecology

> Tarry demodands make up the bulk of the armies of the [[Thanatotic titan|Thanatotic titans]]. Despite being the weakest of their race, tarry demodands are still more powerful than many other [[Outsider|outsiders]] due to their tiny sparks of [[Deity|divinity]]. Tarry demodands prefer dual wielding light weapons, only using heavier ones when ordered to do so by their superiors.
