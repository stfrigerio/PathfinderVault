> **Iron golems** are a type of [[Golem|golem]] created from [[Iron|iron]] by a powerful [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]].



## Appearance

> They are generally [[Humanoid|humanoid]] in shape, stand 12 feet tall, and weigh 5,000 pounds. They are usually crafted so as to appear to be wearing iron [[Armour|armour]].


## Abilities

> Iron golems are sometimes given a [[Weapon|weapon]], but this is scarcely necessary as they can strike incredibly powerful blows with their iron fists. They can also exhale a cloud of [[Poison|poisonous]] gas.
> Their iron construction makes them difficult to damage, and they shrug off most weapons. Only attackers with great strength or wielding an [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]] weapon can reliably harm them.
> In common with most golems, iron golems are immune to all but a handful of [[Spell|spells]]. Electricity slows them down, but fire can actually heal them. They are, however, subject to rust.


## Construction

> To create an iron golem, a golemwright needs 5,000 pounds of iron, and must add rare (and expensive) compounds during the smelting process. Moulding the body requires skill at crafting weapons or armourâ€”mere blacksmithing skill is not sufficient. A number of extremely powerful spells must be cast to animate the construct, and some of these are not readily available to most [[Divine|divine]] casters, so iron golems are usually constructed by [[Arcane|arcane]] casters such as [[Wizard|wizards]].


## Variants

> In ancient times, it was not unknown for iron golems to be created that were much larger than the standard size, although it was a rare civilisation that possessed the resources to do so.
> It was mistakenly thought that the [[Nex|Nexian]] capital of [[Quantium]] possessed two huge iron golems that ceaselessly patrolled its boundaries. Upon more careful study, it was revealed that the pair are [[Quantium golem|quantium golems]], the only two known to exist on [[Golarion]], built millennia ago by the archmage [[Nex (person)|Nex]] himself.
