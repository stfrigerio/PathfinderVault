> **Glabrezus** are monstrous [[Demon|demons]] known as much for their treachery and deceit as for their massive bulk and second set of arms, each ending in a giant, razor-sharp pincer. They are sometimes known as **treachery demons**.



## Associated sins

> Betrayal, treachery, and treason.


## Appearance

> A glabrezu stands 18 feet tall and weighs just over 6,000 pounds, with much of its scaly, horn-covered figure dominated by its second set of arms. While a glabrezu's first set of arms resembles typical, if incredibly muscular, [[Humanoid|humanoid]] appendages, its second set is much larger and sports massive claws, or pincers in place of hands.

## Habitat and ecology

> Whereas [[Succubus|succubi]] are demons that work their wiles by exploiting the physical lusts and needs of their prey, glabrezus are tempters of a different sort. Ferocious and bestial in form, glabrezus are in fact masters of trickery and lies. With the ability to cloak their true forms in pleasant [[Illusion|illusions]], glabrezus use their [[Magic|magic]] to grant *wishes* to [[Mortal|mortal]] humanoids as a method of rewarding those who succumb to their guile and deceit. A *wish* granted by a glabrezu always fulfills the wisher's need in the most destructive way possibleâ€”although such methods might not be immediately apparent. A struggling [[Weapon|weaponsmith]] might wish for fame and skill at his craft, only to find that his best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses the weapons to further his destructive desires. A lonely man who wishes for a companion might have his *wish* granted in the form of a lost love returned to "life" as a [[Vampire|vampire]], and so onâ€”glabrezus are nothing if not creative in addressing a mortal's desires.
> These treacherous demons form from the [[Soul|souls]] of the treasonous, the false, and the subversiveâ€”souls of mortals who, in life, bore false witness or used treachery and deceit to ruin the lives of others. Glabrezus often serve the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Baphomet]], acting as advisors to the [[Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth]] and seeding new cults in cities in which the Lord of the [[Minotaur|Minotaurs]] has yet to leave his mark. Glabrezus outside of Baphomet's service, however, rarely start to work with cults; for the most part, these demons feel that surrounding themselves with devoted demon-worshippers limits their ability to do what they enjoy bestâ€”namely, tempting and corrupting innocents unprepared for what they are dealing with.

> Glabrezus rule some of the petty fiefdoms of the [[Worldwound]], maintaining their power through manipulation rather than sheer force. They are also commonly [[Summoned|summoned]] by [[Spellcaster|magic-users]] hoping to take advantage of the *wishes* these demons can grant, although glabrezus dislike being summoned for these purposes. More often than not, mortals willing to perform the blasphemous sacrifices and [[Ritual|rituals]] needed to summon a treachery demon are already too sinful and corrupt for a demon to have many opportunities to tempt them into debasing themselves even further, leading glabrezus to see such summons as wasting of their time unless offered the chance to gain access to unspoiled souls to corrupt.
