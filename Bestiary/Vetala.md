> **Vetalas** are a breed of [[Vampire|vampire]] native to the sub-continent of [[Vudra]]. Unlike traditional vampires, however, vetalas feed on the creative consciousness or psyche (called "prana" in [[Human languages of Golarion#Vudrani|Vudrani]]) of others, and are particularly drawn to those endowed with great force of will, creativity, or those simply destined for greatness.
> Some scholars are comparing between them and [[Psychic vampire|Psychic vampires]], resulted to be **vetalaranas**.


## History

> Vetals trace their origins to a mysterious strain of vampires known as the [[Strigoi|strigoi]], as all true vampires do. The strigoi originally gave rise to the bestial [[Nosferatu|nosferatu]], who in turn became the progenitors of the [[Moroi|moroi]] when the ancestors of the latter strain chose to abandon their ancestors' bestial lifestyles. Some moroi went further than this, and decided that the mere act of feeding on the unclean blood of "lesser beings" was a debasement of their dignity. While their abstinence from blood nearly killed them, some learned how to feed directly from others' minds, thus becoming the first true vetalas.
