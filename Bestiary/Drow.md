> **Drow**, or **dark elves**, are the descendants of the [[Elf|elves]] who refused to abandon [[Golarion]] when it was discovered that the [[Starstone]] would hit the world. Unlike their cousins, they did not escape through a [[Elf gate|dimensional portal]], but rather hid themselves in the [[Darklands]] below. Something changed these elves during their stay, and when the other elves returned, they found their brethren bitter, twisted, and [[Evil|evil]] enemies.



## History


### Origin of the drow

> During the [[Age of Legend]], the ancestors of today's drow race were simply elves living in the northwest corner of [[Avistan]], in a small forest kingdom around the city of [[Celwynvian]]. An elven secret society known as the [[Winter Council]] had discovered that the antediluvian [[Alghollthu|alghollthu]] races were behind the rise of the [[Human|human]] civilizations of [[Azlant]] and [[Thassilon]]. They also learned that the alghollthus had grown tired of humanity's arrogance and planned to destroy them by calling down a [[Meteor|meteor]] from the heavens.
> With time to avoid this cataclysmic event, the elves called out to their brethren to flee Golarion for their ancient refuge of [[Sovyrian]] on the [[Planet|planet]] [[Castrovel]], via the powerful aiudara gate known as the [[Sovyrian Stone]]. Most did so, but a few elves refused to abandon [[Golarion]]. The exact reasons why they chose to stay behind is still a matter of debate among the elves. Some believe it was out of loyalty to this world, while others suggest that the drow were a political faction who were against the passive elven response to humanity's encroachment on their land.

> Whatever the true reason, a group of elves fled into the [[Caves of the Craven]] below the [[Calphiak Mountains]], believing that they could escape the surface world's destruction by simply delving deep enough into the Darklands. When [[Earthfall]] struck, the Darklands were shaken by tremendous tremors, strong enough to briefly wake [[Rovagug]], the [[Deity|god]] of destruction who had been imprisoned far below during the [[Age of Creation]]. As his wakened mind reached out, it touched the cave where the elves had sequestered themselves, and mixed with the Darklands' strange [[Radiation|radiations]] and the elves' own feelings of betrayal and anger. It transformed them, turning their hair white and skin dark, and replaced the race's natural tendencies towards independence and [[Good|good]] with Rovagug's evil; these elves became the first generation of drow.


## Half-drow

***Main article: [[Half-drow]]***
> [[Half-drow]], sometimes called **darkborn** by humans or **thinblood** by drow, are the equivalent of [[Half-elf|half-elves]] but derive their elven ancestry from drow. Half-drow are a taboo topic among the drow, and are generally the result of matings between drow matrons (or would-be matrons) and important humans.
