> **Whipcrack** district is located at the eastern part of the city of [[Egorian]] in [[Cheliax]].  It is located between [[Aspex Garden]] and [[Sorrowgate]] districts.
> The district of Whipcrack, along with [[Long Market]], houses the slave market as well as those industries and business requiring a lot of cheap labor. Auctioneers are here regularly to sell new stock to the highest bidder. Numerous miserable [[Halfling|halfling]]-proportioned dwellings fill half of the district.
> It is also home to the Imperial Stadium, where blood sports and other spectacles take place. The public houses surrounding the complex are extremely profitable due to the popularity of the stadium.
