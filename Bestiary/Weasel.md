> **Weasels** are mammalian predators with elongated, fur-covered bodies, and short legs useful in following their prey into burrows. Many species of weasel exist, including the **mink**, **stoat** and **ermine**, and they are popular as [[Familiar|familiars]] for [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]].



## Ecology

> Weasels, alongside ferrets, are notable for being immune to the petrifying effects of a [[Cockatrice|cockatrice]]'s bite and a [[Basilisk|basilisk]]'s gaze, and sometimes sneak into the lairs of these creatures to consume their eggs and young.


## Variants

> A much rarer **giant weasel** species can grow up to 9 feet in length and weigh over 300 pounds. Amongst other locations, giant weasels are found on the [[Nesmian Plains]] of southern [[Nirmathas]].
> **Ermine** are a type of weasel with white fur that can blend into snowy environments, improving its stealthiness.
