> **Nagaji** are a race of [[Serpent|serpent-like]] [[Humanoid|humanoid]] creatures native to the [[Tian Xia]] realm of [[Nagajor]]. With [[Humanoid|humanoid]] figures and serpentine heads, nagaji are heralds, companions, and servitors of powerful [[Naga|nagas]]. They hold a deep reverence for holy areas and spiritual truths, an aspect many others find as intimidating as a nagaji's appearance.
