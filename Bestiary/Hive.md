> The **hive** are an invasive alien species that seek to spread across worlds and devour all other life.



## Name

> The hive's endonym is an [[Nonhuman languages of Golarion|Aklo]] word that the [[Human|human]] mouth cannot pronounce.


## Ecology

> The hive spread their [[Hive larva|larvae]] through hosts to conquer new worlds. While infested creatures usually become a [[Hive warrior|hive warrior]], mutations can create hive creatures that retain the capabilities of the original creatures. Those hosts who wish to cleanse themselves of hive corruption could resort to [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]], or seek out the help of the hive's original creators, the [[Anunnaki|anunnaki]].
> Hive creatures have no [[Language|language]], instead communicating simple concepts via pheromone discharge and body language that the rest of the hive understand. Hive creatures lack eyes and see the world through other senses. Their blood is corrosive, and they have no need to eat, drink, or sleep.


## On [[Golarion]]

> [[Eloiander of Ridwan]], leader of the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of the [[Shades of the Uskwood]], has captured and kept a hive queen imprisoned in a [[Magic|magical]] cell in the middle of the [[Uskwood]] in [[Nidal]]; as a result, hive creatures are very common in the Uskwood. The Shades seek to explore the mechanisms of the hive and control its corruption.
> The hive also grow in the remote corners of Golarion, like parts of [[Numeria]] and the [[Valashmai Jungle]]. Technological solutions to hive corruption are said to exist in Numeria, but the [[Technic League]] holds tight control over any evidence of such claims.
