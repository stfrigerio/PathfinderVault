> Feathered [[Serpent|serpents]] that usually serve the highest powers of [[Good|good]], **couatls** are not only powerful creatures but are also powerful symbols of goodness. There are a few varieties of couatl with differing [[Philosophy|philosophies]] and appearances. Couatls often serve as messengers for good [[Deity|deities]] or directly intercede in the lives of [[Mortality|mortals]] under their own powers, but all couatls seek to drive mortals to their highest possible potential. Couatls themselves have three gods whose word and missions trump all others named [[Cihua Couatl]], Pahti Couatl, and Tolte Couatl.
> [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] legend states that the [[Sahkil|sahkils]] and the couatl both rose after the creation of mortals and work in opposition. The sahkils seek the decline of mortals into fear, while the couatls seek their uplift. Couatls thus work to combat the sahkils when possible.
