> Powerful [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]] create cruel military commanders to reap [[Soul|souls]] as **dullahans**. Dullahans typically haunt the areas where they lived to search for [[Evil|evil]] victims, but settle for innocents as well. Dullahan can target a person by name, which gains it extra power against its victim.
> Dullahans can [[Summon|summon]] a [[Fiendish|fiendish]] heavy war [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]]. Extremely powerful dullahans can instead summon a carriage and six horses. These dullahans are called **Coach of the Silent**.
> The original template for the dullahans is an inhabitant of the [[First World]] known as the [[Headless King]].
