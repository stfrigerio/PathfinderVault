> **Remorhazes** are enormous [[Centipede|centipede-like]] creatures that live in the frozen north of [[Golarion]], preferring in particular the ice and snow of glaciers. When excited, its back gives off a tremendous heat that allows it to burrow with ease through the solid glaciers, creating intricate tunnel mazes in the process.


## Appearance

> A remorhaz's body is covered in spiky and chitinous protective plates. It can grow to around 25 feet in length and weighs up to 10,000 pounds. Tremendous fires are said to burn within the creature's body, which cause the outer plates to glow white hot when a remorhaz is in pain or excited. Dozens of insect-like legs propel it forward and aid in burrowing.


## On Golarion

> These creatures are found in the far northern reaches of [[Avistan]] and across the [[Crown of the World]]. The [[Algid Wastes]], a cold and inhospitable wasteland that forms the border between the [[Hold of Belkzen]] and [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], is home to countless of these "**ghost worms**", as the native [[Orc|orcs]] call them. Remorhazes are also common in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]; they are known to dwell within the living [[Elemental|elemental]] known as the [[Monolith Glacier]] and are rampant across the [[Iceworm Hills]] (alongside the more lethal [[Frost worm|frost worms]]) where they are hunted by the native [[Varki]] people. Remorhazes are also found with some frequency in the [[Kodar Mountains]] of northern [[Varisia]], the more southerly [[Fog Peaks]] of [[Taldor]], and [[Galt]].
