> **Formian taskmasters** are a [[Formian|formian]] caste who serve in the roles of commerce and diplomacy.


## Society

> Formian taskmasters often leave the hive in commercial or diplomatic missions, escorted by [[Formian worker|workers]] and [[Formian warrior|warriors]]. They recognise that [[Telepathy|telepathy]] can be unnerving to other species, but their mandibles are not suited to speech, which is often hoarse and hard to understand.
> Taskmasters are highly competitive and proud of their accomplishments, which they carve and highlight on their exoskeletons. They sometimes duel over a trade route, an insult or promotions: these duels are rarely lethal to avoid weakening the hive and attracting the wrong attention from [[Formian myrmarch|myrmarchs]].
