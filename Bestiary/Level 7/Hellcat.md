> **Hellcats** are intelligent [[Smilodon|smilodon]]-like predators native to [[Hell]].



## Appearance

> The hellcat is only clearly visible in dim light as a smilodon burning with [[Hellfire|hellfire]], which is its actual blood. Its flesh is transparent and invisible, giving it a skeletal appearance. In bright light, its entire body fades away into obscurity, while in darkness its glowing blood is muted. Hellcats are as large as [[Tiger|tigers]], measuring nine feet long and weighing 900 pounds.


## Ecology

> Being [[Outsider|outsiders]], hellcats do not need food, but like to hunt for fun and leave their kills behind for others to find. Though incapable of speech, hellcats are capable of [[Telepathy|telepathy]] and understanding the [[Infernal|Infernal language]]. Against foes they cannot hopefully defeat, hellcats are quick to retreat but always remember them and often track potential victims and try to lead allies to aid them.


## Society

> Hellcats often serve [[Devil|devils]] or [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] as hunters and mounts. Due to their intelligence, they are offended by the idea of being anyone else's pet, and have to be treated with respect, or they might nurture a grudge. In such instances, a hellcat plans an elaborate revenge, hoping to satisfy its own pride and to provide a lesson to all those who would deal with hellcats.
