> **Capramaces** are wild [[Sorted Traits/creature/aberration|aberrations]] that look like a cross between a [[Human|human]] and a [[Goat|goat]]. They roam the [[Mana Wastes]].



## Appearance

> A capramace has the head of a horned goat and somewhat humanoid body, but with a backward-facing torso and four hooves. Its flesh has a coppery red tone.


## Habitat and ecology

> Capramaces are a product of the Mana Wastes' [[Mutation|mutative]] properties, and roam the wastes in wild packs or herds of up to two dozen. None know how they came into being.
> A few inhabitants of the wastes attempt to domesticate and use capramaces as work animals, but most simply try to avoid disturbing them.


## Abilities

> A capramace can call for its herd with a deafening scream that can be heard from up to a mile away.
