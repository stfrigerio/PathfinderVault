> **Ngogas** are animalistic hybrids of orangutans and the [[Cyclops|cyclopes]] of the lost kingdom of [[Ghol-Gan]].


## History

> According to cyclopean legends, ngogas were a gift from their otherworldly patrons near the collapse of Ghol-Gan. Since the fall of Ghol-Gan, ngogas have proliferated throughout the tropical rainforests of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] and can be found as deep as [[Usaro]].


## Society

> Ngogas possess the same brutality and insight as cyclopes, but lack intelligence. They were trained as war beasts by Ghol-Gani soldiers, and modern cyclopes continue to feel a sense of kinship to them, often offering them fruit and meat to gain an ally. In [[Mwangi]] folk tales, ngogas are infamous for their unpredictability and agility. They are also trained by [[Ruthazek]] as mounts for his smaller minions, relying on their speed to stage ambushes.
