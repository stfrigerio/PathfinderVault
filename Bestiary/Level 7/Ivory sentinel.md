> **Ivory sentinels** are [[Thassilonian sentinel|Thassilonian sentinels]] made in the shape of a skull with delicate [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird]] wings, capable of emitting a screech to disorient peasants and foreign dignitaries. They were most often employed as palace guards by the highest [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] nobles, especially in [[Bakrakhan]] and [[Shalast]], and most were destroyed during [[Earthfall]] when the palaces fell.
