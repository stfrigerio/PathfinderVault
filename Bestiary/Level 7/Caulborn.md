> The **caulborn** are a species of [[Telepathic|telepathic]] [[Plane|planar]] scholars and researchers hailing from the [[Ethereal Plane]] and united by a species-wide shared memory. Their lives are almost entirely devoted to seeking out new information to add to their collective consciousness, and they have little interest in interactions with other beings that do not further this goal.



## Appearance

> A typical caulborn vaguely resembles a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] creature, though with many alien features, including a split lower jaw, fleshy growths on its head resembling a hood, bony protrusions across its body, elongated index and middle fingers, and an eyeless face.


## Ecology

> Caulborn are created from [[Ioton|iotons]] who absorb particularly profound thoughts. Caulborn subsist on the accumulation of esoteric knowledge in the form of [[Psychic magic|psychic energy]]; their bodies do not need other types of sustenance. As hive-minded creatures, caulborn pool their collected knowledge in a brain-sac called a [[Caulborn chrestomath|chrestomath]]. A caulborn can consume knowledge both by learning about new information and by taking it from physical contact with other creatures.


## Society

> Groups of up to a dozen caulborn often travel with their chrestomath as their joint focus, and upon finding an interesting location, might settle there for years to comprehensively understand it.
> Little individual society exists in these groups; all caulborn treat each other equally, though individuals who consume the highest-quality [[Psychic energy|psychic energy]] or remain closest to the powerful concentration of energy of a chrestomath become more powerful as a result. These improved caulborn are known as [[Caulborn thoughtkeeper|thoughtkeepers]].


## On Golarion

> Although not native to [[Golarion]], caulborn have lived beneath the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]] for years beyond [[Human|human]] (or even [[Elf|elven]]) reckoning. These caulborn maintain a long-standing alliance with a cabal of [[Vampire|vampires]], who provide them with thoughts and feed on their blood, both spying on the people of the city above. The city of [[Xavorax]] hosts a colony of caulborn, including thoughtkeepers, as a hive around their chrestomath, [[Anamnesis]].
> There is also a settlement of caulborn in a large cavern under modern-day [[Nidal]], known as the Grove of Memory. This cavern used to be where the [[Kellid|Kellids]] who inhabited the land before [[Earthfall]] laid their most honored dead to rest. The caulborn would grow a tree of memory out of the fallen Kellid, a tree with glowing orange fruit that contained all of the Kellid's memories. In exchange for the body, the caulborn would allow the Kellids to occasionally eat the fruit of these trees, and thus the Kellids preserved the memories and knowledge of their people over generations. Eventually, a group of [[Elves|elves]] discovered the grove and set up an *[[Elf gate|aiudara]]* there, trading the bodies of their dead for access to the knowledge stored in the grove. But after Earthfall, when the Kellids made a pact with [[Zon-Kuthon]] and the elves fled Golarion, nobody else came to trade memories, and the caulborn there continue to wait and tend to their forest.


## In the Great Beyond

> While caulborn originate from the Ethereal Plane, they have spread to numerous planes in their quest for new knowledge. They still maintain a fortress known as Xevnorvex in the Ethereal Plane, an organic structure that serves as both a repository for the caulborn's accumulated knowledge and as living quarters for the caulborn themselves.
