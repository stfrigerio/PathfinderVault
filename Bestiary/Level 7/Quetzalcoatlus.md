*This article is about the type of [[Pterosaur|pterosaur]]. For the [[Couatl|couatl]], see [[Quetz couatl|quetz couatl]].*
> The **quetzalcoatlus** is the largest-known species of [[Pterosaur|pterosaur]], a family of [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaur]]-like reptiles often found in the company of true dinosaurs. It is sometimes known as the **swampstalker**, **swamp stalker**, or **dragonling**.
> It has an impressive 40-foot wingspan, and on the ground it somewhat resembles a giraffe with wings (albeit one with a razor sharp beak). They are found in flocks of up to six creatures.
> The beasts are huge and powerful, and are notoriously difficult to train.
