> This article might have further canon details available on **[[httpsstarfinderwikicomSalamander|StarfinderWiki]]**.


> **Salamanders** are a race of [[Evil|evil]], intelligent, reptile-like [[Outsider|outsiders]] from the [[Plane of Fire|Elemental Plane of Fire]].



## Appearance

> A salamander has the body of a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake]], the head of a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Lizard|lizard]], and a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] upper torso. Its skin is blackened red and crackles with flames.


## Habitat

> Salamanders typically live in temperatures of at least 500 â„‰ and only grudgingly tolerate lower temperatures, which turn them even surlier and short-tempered than normal. For the same reason, they only value treasures that can withstand high temperatures.
> Many salamanders migrate from their home in the Plane of Fire to the [[Abyss]], due to their respect for [[Demon|demons]], especially those associated with fire, like [[Balor|balors]]. Others come to the [[Material Plane]] where the barrier between it and the Plane of Fire is thin, generally near areas of frequent [[Volcano|volcanic]] activity, or are [[Summon|summoned]] as guardians or smiths. These salamanders are capable of producing [[Ifrit|ifrit]] offspring with [[Human|humans]], although this is rare.


## Society

> Salamanders are renowned warriors and [[Metal|metalworkers]], leading many of them to be [[Slavery|enslaved]] by stronger natives of the Plane of Fire, like [[Efreeti|efreet]] and [[Magma dragon|magma dragons]]; for this reason, salamanders despise efreet. Sometimes, these salamanders are bound to their forge in servitude, which causes them to become [[Undead|undead]] [[Ashen forgemaster|ashen forgemasters]] upon death.
> Salamander society is cruel and respects nothing outside of power. A slow, painful death awaits all weaker beings that dare annoy a salamander.
> Relatively few salamanders worship [[Ymeri]], the [[Elemental lord|elemental lord]] of fire, instead preferring the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Flauros]]. This has led to conflict between the two over the salamanders' worship.


## On Golarion

> A tribe of salamanders has been reported in the [[Flume Warrens]] of the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Sekamina]]. This region is rife with volcanic vents, making it perfect for the heat-loving salamanders. These tribes are in constant conflict with a local group of [[Azer|azers]], and seek an alliance with the [[Fire giant|fire giants]] of the [[Mindspin Mountains]] above in order to defeat their rivals. The salamanders have been compelled by the [[Giant|giants]] to stage numerous attacks on the [[Kobold|kobolds]] of the Embermaw clan, which lairs directly above the Flume Warrens, but these invasions have not been successful.
