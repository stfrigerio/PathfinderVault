> A **shadow demon** (also known as an **invidiak**) is a sinister, incorporeal [[Demon|demon]].



## Associated sin

> Shadow demons are associated with the sin of envy.


## Appearance

> A shadow demon appears as a cloud of darkness with [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bat]]-like wings and sharp claws. They are slightly larger than [[Human|humans]], but are weightless because they are incorporeal.


## Abilities

> A shadow demon can fight with its teeth and claws, and has a number of [[Magic|magical]] abilities connected to manipulating shadows. They can also blend into any available shadows to effectively become invisible. Perhaps their most insidious [[Spell|spell]]-like ability is their ability to possess [[Mortal|mortals]]. In a mortal body they are no longer vulnerable to sunlight, but if the mortal body is struck by a sudden burst of powerful magical light, the possessing shadow demon is immediately expelled.


## Habitat and ecology

> Shadow demons are formed in the [[Abyss]] from envious [[Soul|souls]]. They typically form groups of up to eight, and are known to flee from sunlight.


## Society

> Shadow demons are believed to have once served the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Vyriavaxus]]. When [[Nocticula]] slew their patron, they grudgingly transferred their services to her. Some also serve the demon lord [[Shax]].


## Environment

> Shadow demons are native to the [[Abyss]].


## Summoning

> Those seeking to [[Summon|summon]] a shadow demon sometimes do so in areas of bright sunlight. This reduces the shadow demon's power but is guaranteed to enrage it.


## On Golarion

> A group of shadow demons loyal to Shax have possessed a tribe of [[Kellid]] [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]] and used them to commit uncounted atrocities in [[Sabertooth Vale]] in the [[Worldwound]].


> [[Paizo]] published a sourcebook about demons called *[[Demons Revisited]]*, which includes a chapter about shadow demons.
