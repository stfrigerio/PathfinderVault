> **Chaos beasts** are living manifestations of entropy native to the [[Maelstrom]].


## Appearance

> A chaos beast resembles a horrid mass of eyes, teeth, tentacles, stingers, claws, and so on, constantly twisting upon itself and reshaping into new forms.


## Ecology

> Chaos beasts are formed from the majority of the shapeless [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] in the [[Maelstrom]], who neither petitioned a [[Protean|protean]] chorus to be transformed into one of them, nor qualified for transformation into a [[Valkyrie|valkyrie]] or [[Einherji|einherji]]. Sometimes, they just form out of the raw Maelstrom itself. The chaos beast's attack [[Curse|curses]] its foe with an amorphous body that is constantly melting, flowing, writhing, and boiling. Chaos beasts are resistant to [[Transmutation|transmutation]] effects, quickly reverting to its normal form if forcibly transformed.
