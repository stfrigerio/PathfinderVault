> **Ichkohs** are [[Sahkil|sahkils]] that savour the fear of the failure of the flesh.


## Appearance

> The ichkoh looks like a six-foot-tall, 140-pound-heavy [[Cockroach|cockroach]] made from putrid hair and a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] face in place of an insect's head.


## Ecology

> Ichkohs enjoy tormenting those who take pride in their bodies with the knowledge of how they failed to maintain their bodies in their youth. Some ichkohs pursue a single creature for years, encouraging increasingly self-destructive behaviour that can eventually drive the victim to suicide.
