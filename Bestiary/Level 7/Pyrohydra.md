> **Pyrohydras** are a variant of [[Hydra|hydras]] distinguished by their ability to breathe fire. They tend to prefer drier environments than they swamp-dwelling relatives do, and their ability to cauterize neck stumps *en masse* with their fiery breath gives these creatures a considerable advantage when fighting other hydras.


## In Golarion

> Pyrohydras roam the deserts and rocky badlands of northern [[Garund]], and are a consistent danger for passing caravans. [[Rules/Classes/Druid|Druids]] from the [[Thuvia|Thuvian]] city of [[Duwwor]], however, have managed to train over a dozen of these creatures, and the rulers of several city-states are considering enlisting them to protect shipments of *[[Sun orchid elixir|sun orchid elixir]]*. In [[Avistan]], pyrohydras are found within the caverns of the [[Cinderlands]].
