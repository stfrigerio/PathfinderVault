> **Gortheks** are a species of particularly cranky ungulates commonly used as mounts by [[Orc|orcs]].



## Appearance

> A gorthek appears as a strange combination of [[Bison|bison]] and [[Rhinoceros|rhinoceros]], with a thick [[Lion|leonine]] head crowned by [[Ram|ram]] horns and framed by shaggy hair. Its hide is thick, wrinkled, and extraordinarily difficult to pierce. An adult male gorthek stands about seven feet high at the shoulder and weighs around 9,000 pounds.


## Ecology

> Gortheks live in small herds, grazing across grasslands and sparsely wooded hills. They perceive almost everything else as a threat and will launch themselves at enemies, intent on sending them flying.


## Society

> Orcs commonly raise gortheks from infancy as mounts and living [[Siege engine|siege engines]]. They are bonded with their future riders from a very young age, and orcs have fashioned the *gorthek masks* in order to [[Magic|magically]] facilitate this bond. In battle, gorthek riders sit on a specifically designed saddle and control their mount with spiked reins.
