> This article might have further canon details available on **[[httpsstarfinderwikicomShaitan|StarfinderWiki]]**.


> The **shaitan** (pronounced shy-TAWN) are a race of [[Genie|genies]] from the [[Plane of Earth|Elemental Plane of Earth]]. Noble shaitans are called **pashas**.



## Appearance

> Shaitans resemble [[Humanoid|humanoids]] and appear to be carved from rock, with glossy skin and glittering eyes. When they move it sounds like stone grating on stone. A typical specimen is 11 feet tall and weighs 5,000 pounds. They are stronger than [[Djinni|djinn]], but not as strong as the other genies. Their powers centre around control of stone: they can burrow through stone, or simply glide through it as if it wasn't there. They can bull rush foes into stone so that they are held fast, and can shape stone to their design. They can also transform one [[Metal|metal]] into another, although this transformation lasts only one day.


## Habitat and society

> Shaitans maintain an empire that spans the Elemental Plane of Earth known as the Peerless Empire, with its capital at the [[Opaline Vault]]. This is the seat of their ruler, [[Ashadieeyah bint Khalid|Sultana Ashadieeyah bint Khalid]], who oversees the race's mining operations and trade. They love working with metal and stone, and also love to enter into bargains, particularly those they can twist to their own benefit.
> Shaitans are not cruel, but neither are they kind. Their empire makes extensive use of [[Slavery|slavery]] with ruthless efficiency, binding a wide array of slaves for all sorts of purposes. They prefer slaves willing to sell themselves into servitude, only forcibly enslaving those who oppose them; these creatures often spend the rest of their lives toiling in the Peerless Empire's vaults.
> Shaitans tend to be boastful and egotistical, and sulk if their pride is hurt. They dress in as much finery as they can afford, and sometimes use [[Illusion|illusions]] to increase the impression of wealth. They prefer to live in tunnels and palaces carved out of Elemental Earth, but can sometimes be found living underground on the [[Material Plane]]. Their cities teem with other races like [[Janni|jann]], [[Oread|oreads]], or [[Dwarf|dwarves]], who, for the most part, are allowed to freely travel as long as they do not instigate trouble.
> Shaitans have diplomatic relations with nearly all other races of the Plane of Earth. They employ [[Xorn|xorns]] to assist in mining newly discovered mineral deposits, subjugate [[Earth mephit|earth]] and [[Salt mephit|salt mephits]] and push contracts of servitude on them, seek to enlist [[Earth elemental|earth elementals]] and [[Scanderig|scanderigs]] for the purpose of war, maintain an accord with [[Crystal dragon|crystal dragons]], and recruit oreads as envoys between them and xorns or [[Xiomorn|xiomorns]].
> The Opaline Vault is openly at war with the [[Efreeti|efreet]] of the [[Plane of Fire|Elemental Plane of Fire]], and its government refuses all dealings with efreet and orders shaitan outposts on the Plane of Fire's border to watch for efreet incursions. However, for the most part, the conflict is limited to being between the Opaline Vault and the [[City of Brass]], and shaitans usually hold no enmity against efreet, even sometimes working with them when their interests align.


### Shaitan pashas

> **Shaitan pashas**, who comprise about one per cent of the shaitan population, can create earthquakes and grant *wishes* to non-genies. Shaitan society is divided into great craft guilds, each ruled by a pasha.


## On the Material Plane

> On the Material Plane, shaitans are capable of producing oread offspring with [[Human|humans]], and pass on many of their qualities to their children. They can sometimes be found deep within the [[Darklands]], such as the [[Orv|Orvian]] Vault known as the [[Land of Black Blood]]. Although they command quite a high price, shaitans (along with other genies) can be purchased in the [[Slave|slave]] markets of the [[Qadira|Qadiran]] city of [[Sedeq]].
