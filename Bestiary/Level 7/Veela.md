> **Veelas** are capricious [[Elemental|elemental]] spirits given [[Humanoid|humanoid]] form.


## Appearances

> Veelas are lithe and androgynous, with unusually coloured skin and an otherworldly grace. A veela typically stands just under six feet tall and weighs approximately 140 pounds.


## Ecology

> On their home [[Plane|planes]], veelas revel in and draw power from the unbridled energy of the [[Element|elements]]. On other planes, they lose some of the [[Elemental energy|elemental energy]] saturating their forms, for which they can compensate by engaging in dances with other creatures and siphoning vitality from them. Veelas usually only do this, except in the direst circumstances, with willing partners, leaving them exhausted but exhilarated. Those who can match their movements might earn a veela's respect and compel it to share some beneficial [[Magic|magical]] powers.
