> The **adhukait** are a strange-looking race of twinned [[Asura|asura]]. Well-known adhukaits include [[Caiiac]] and [[Kaisadvaisad]].


## Appearance

> Adhukaits appear as two thorn-covered, gray [[Humanoid|humanoids]] joined by ties of flesh and chain. Knowing how their bizarre appearance startles [[Mortal|mortals]], they revel in frightening them with a deadly blade dance.


## Habitat & Ecology

> Adhukaits' creation also has two distinct stories. One story says the creatures first arose from the corpses of two near-divine brigands who died while attempting to steal a great treasure from an ancient [[Deity|god]]. Their bodies fell into 12 pieces when they were destroyed, causing great calamities, and adhukaits were born of the destruction. Another story says that two asuras challenged a great warrior to a fight one after the other. When the asuras inevitably attacked at once, they were struck with such force and fury by the warrior, angry at this betrayal, that they fused together. Adhukaits practise theft, kidnapping, and other crimes of stealth to torment the innocent and frustrate the gods.
> Adhukaits particularly lair in lonely, forgotten regions of [[Hell]], particularly in [[Erebus]] and [[Caina]].
