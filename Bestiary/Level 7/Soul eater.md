    desc: " ([[detection]], [[divine]], [[divination]]);  A conjured soul eater forms a mental link with its conjurer. While both are on the same plane, the soul eater knows the location of its conjurer per its find target ability. If the soul eater's target dies before the soul eater can drain its soul, or if the soul eater is defeated (but not destroyed) by the target, the soul eater returns to its conjurer and tries to kill them."
  - name: "Find Target"
    desc: " ([[detection]], [[divine]], [[divination]]);  When a soul eater is conjured to the Material Plane to find a specific creature, it gains the benefits of a 5th-level [[locate]] spell that isn't blocked by lead or running water. The conjurer must have seen the target and must speak the target's name while conjuring the soul eater in order to grant this ability."

    desc: "⬽ ([[death]], [[divine]], [[manipulate]], [[necromancy]]); __Requirements__ The soul eater is adjacent to a [[dying|dying]] creature  __Effect__  The soul eater attempts to devour the [[dying|dying]] creature's soul. The creature must attempt a DC 25 Will save. A creature that dies as a result of Drain Soul can't be restored to life except by a spell or ritual of 8th level or higher. If the soul eater that used Drain Soul on a creature is slain within 100 feet of that creature's corpse and the creature has been dead no longer than 1 minute, the creature's soul returns to its body and is restored to life, leaving the creature [[unconscious|unconscious]] and [[dying|dying 1]] but no longer [[doomed|doomed]].\n__Critical Success__ The creature is unaffected.\n__Success__ The creature becomes [[doomed|doomed 1]], or increases its [[doomed|doomed]] value by 1 if it was already [[doomed|doomed]].\n__Failure__ As success, but [[doomed|doomed 2]].\n__Critical Failure__ As success, but [[doomed|doomed 3]]."
  - name: "Mind-Numbing Touch"
    desc: " ([[curse]], [[divine]], [[necromancy]]);  When a soul eater hits a creature with its claw [[Strike]], the creature must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or become [[stupefied|stupefied 1]] ([[stupefied|stupefied 2]] on a critical failure). Further damage dealt by the soul eater increases the [[stupefied|stupefied]] value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of [[stupefied|stupefied 4]]. This condition value decreases by 1 each time the creature gets a full night's rest. As long as the creature is [[stupefied|stupefied]] by a soul eater, rest does not decrease any [[doomed|doomed]] value that creature might have."

> **Soul eaters** are [[Outsider|outsiders]] native to [[Abaddon]] capable of eating a victim's [[Soul|soul]].



## Appearance

> A soul eater is a cloud of inky smoke with spindly arms that end in taloned fingers. They silently slither through the air like a [[Serpent|serpent]].


## Abilities

> A soul eater's touch can impair its victim's consciousness. When [[Magic/Conjuration|summoned]] to the [[Material Plane]] by a [[Conjurer|conjurer]], it can find any target its summoner has seen and can name aloud regardless of its location or distance—with the exception of running water.
> If a soul eater destroys a victim's consciousness with its claws, it can consume the victim's soul. This kills the victim, prohibits reincarnation, and complicates most simple forms of resurrection.


## Ecology

> While native to the [[Daemon|daemonic]] [[Plane|plane]] of [[Abaddon]], soul eaters are popular creatures to conjure among [[Evil|evil]] spellcasters. When not serving a master, soul eaters—devoid of emotion or reason—perpetually hunt for souls to consume.


## Known examples

> The *oculus of Abaddon* can summon soul eaters.
