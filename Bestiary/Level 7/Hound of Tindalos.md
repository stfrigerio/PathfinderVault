    desc: "  When a hound of Tindalos is not adjacent to a structural angle of 90o (or more acute), its resistance to physical damage is suppressed and it becomes [[sickened|sickened 1]].

  - name: "Angled Entry"
    desc: "â¬»  The hound of Tindalos casts a 4th-level [[dimension door]] spell, but it must transport itself into a space adjacent to an angle of 90o (or more acute) in the structure or environment around it. For example, it could teleport to a space adjacent to a wall (using the angle between the wall and floor) or a corner in a room, or adjacent to a sizable tree growing straight up out of the ground, but not to a flat plain or a room with only curved corners and edges. Once per day, the hound can use this ability to plane shift to or from the Dimension of Time, with the same restrictions on what angles it can appear next to."

> This article might have further canon details available on **[[httpsstarfinderwikicomHound of Tindalos|StarfinderWiki]]**.


> **Hounds of Tindalos** are creatures from outside the reality [[Golarion]] exists in. They only interfere in Golarion when a [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]] foolishly [[Summon|summons]] one or when someone interferes in their domain. They have some sort of connection to the angles of reality, which allows them to appear anywhere and at any time on Golarion as long as they appear near some physical angle.



## Appearance

![[Estra_vs_hound_of_Tindalos.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Estra]] and [[Honaire]] confront a hound of Tindalos and its mistress.
> Hounds of Tindalos are horrific looking creatures whose appearance is as utterly alien as their origins. In stature, hounds of Tindalos appear like some foul mixture of [[Humanoid|humanoid]] and sleek big [[Cat|cat]] that is without fur and whose flesh is pallid and muscular, yet lean as if starved. This strange mixture results in their odd body shape and, despite their long arms ending in dexterous, flesh shredding claws, they usually move about on all fours. Their faces are possibly their most alien feature with huge, black, soulless eyes sitting above a chasm of a mouth filled with razor-sharp, broken teeth.


## Habitat & ecology

> Hounds of Tindalos are native to the little-known [[Dimension of Time]]. According to the [[Steward of Stethelos]], the name *Tindalos* refers to a place beyond the Viridescent Jungle, where "those who flow with time in one direction" have no place, and where only the hounds and their masters can dwell. Hounds of Tindalos are mercifully rare on the [[Material Plane]], where they have no natural habitat. They are usually only found when summoned and [[Binding outsiders|bound]] as some powerful [[Wizard|wizards]] or ancient societies like [[Thassilon]] used to do, or when the hounds hunt their quarry. The only quarry hounds of Tindalos seem interested in are the rare people who have travelled the mysterious pathways outside [[Time|time]] and space itself; the hounds hunt these creatures mercilessly, chasing them to any place or any time they might flee.


## Abilities

> Hounds of Tindalos understand time and space in a way no other creature does and can move effortlessly across huge distances and even across the [[Plane|planes]] themselves. A hound's mind is so otherworldly that any creature that gains direct access to a hound of Tindalos's thoughts is assaulted by the completely alien nature of its thought processes. The gaze of a hound of Tindalos rips through the very fabric of reality itself inflicting horrific wounds on its opponents.


## Variants

> The common hound of Tindalos is the least of their kind. More powerful variants include the **Thing from Beyond Time**, the six-legged **mastiff of Tindalos** that usually serves as companions of [[Denizen of Leng|denizens of Leng]], and the three-headed **ravager of Tindalos**.
