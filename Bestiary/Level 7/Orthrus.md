> The **orthrus** is always male. It resembles a two-headed wolf or dog, whose tail ends in a dragon's head. It, along with the female [[Legendary chimera|legendary chimera]], was created by [[Lamashtu]] to be the ultimate predator. Some of their offspring became the modern [[Chimera|chimera]] but the two monsters normally view each other with hatred. 
> In many ways they are similar to chimeras, but they cannot fly as they lack wings. Their dog-like claws are not suitable as weapons, but each of their heads has a powerful bite and opponents grasped in two or more heads may be ripped apart.
> The placement of their heads gives them the ability to see all sides at once.
