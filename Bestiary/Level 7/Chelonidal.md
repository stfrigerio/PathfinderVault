> **Chelonidals** are a race of turtle-like [[Agathion|agathions]] who serve as [[Nirvana|Nirvanas]] line infantry.



## Appearance

> Chelonidals resemble a cross between a turtle and [[Humanoid|humanoid]]. Their hands resemble turtle flippers more than humanoid hands, but are still capable of fine manipulation. Their bright eyes can see past invisibility, their mouths have a powerful bite force, and their back is protected by a shell that also disperses [[Magic|magical]] attacks and [[Gun|gunshots]]. Their gravel voices generally resemble that of a grizzled veteran. A typical chelonidal is six feet tall and weighs 400Â pounds.


## Ecology

> Chelonidals form from the [[Soul|souls]] of those who willingly gave their lives to defend a person or place, or who protected the sea from terrestrial threats. They guard Nirvana, and like other [[Outsider|outsiders]], chelonidals have no need to eat or sleep, and can vigilantly maintain their post for centuries. As their appearance suggests, they are also at home in the water.
> Due to their tendency to protect locations for long periods, chelonidals on the [[Material Plane]] occasionally fall in love with [[Mortal|mortals]] and produce [[Aasimar's Mercy|aasimar]] (instead of [[Half-celestial|half-celestial]]) children. The chelonidal parent remains until its offspring come of age, departing only in great need.


## Society

> Chelonidals willingly serve stronger agathions, notably the [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lords]] [[Dalenydra]] and [[Ylimancha]]. Sometimes, if a chelonidal can find a replacement for its post, it feels an urge to wander for some time before settling down. Some chelonidals find their way to the Material Plane, where they find a secluded, vulnerable location and defend it while finding or training more protectors.
> Chelonidals often get along well with [[Dwarf|dwarves]], who share their resolve and traditional military tactics. The dwarven [[Deity|god]] [[Trudd]] has arrangements with several chelonidal legions and occasionally dispatches them when requested. Chelonidals are cantankerous in a good-natured way and are fond of war stories.
> A single chelonidal can bolster a mortal legion, while in groups they form a phalanx. When the agathions march to war, chelonidals form the core of their armies, led by [[Cervinal|cervinals]] and supported by [[Avoral|avorals]].
