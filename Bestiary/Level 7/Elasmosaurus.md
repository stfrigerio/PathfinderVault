> The **elasmosaurus** is a huge aquatic reptile with a distinctive long neck. It is not a true [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaur]], but is similar to them in many ways. Its legs end in flippers, making it clumsy on land but a swift swimmer in water. They inhabit tropical lakes and oceans, and can sometimes be found in schools of up to half a dozen creatures. It defends itself by biting with its large teeth. A typical specimen is 45 feet long and 4,000 pounds in weight. However, there are also similar, smaller species of aquatic reptile, such as the plesiosaurus.


## In Golarion

> Elasmosauruses can be found in the subterranean [[Irikusk River]], defending [[High Ilvarandin]] on behalf of their [[Intellect devourer|intellect devourer]] hosts.
> They can also be found in the [[Lake of Vanished Armies]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. Local legend says that they are the offspring of [[Aomak]], a monster believed to lair in the depths of the lake.
> Far to the north, freshwater elasmosauruses (along with countless other aquatic terrors) populate [[Lake Hooktongue]] in the [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] commonly referred to as the [[Stolen Land]].
