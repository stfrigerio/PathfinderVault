> The **steam hog** is a huge [[Warthog|warthog]], outfitted with all manner of steel armor and unnatural augmentations, including a pair of razor-sharp metal tusks. It is one of the unique species of war beasts the [[Fire giant|fire giants]] created for their brutal campaigns. The steam hogs are massive amalgamations of steel and flesh and can weigh up to 3 tons. They head the front lines of fire giant armies, emitting clouds of hot steam from their snouts. The giants used to reforge arms and armor of their defeated foes to dress their beloved war beasts. In this way, the armor and accoutrements of a veteran steam hog serve as a record of the battles the beast has fought in.
