> **Oracular cyclopes** are a [[Cyclops|cyclops]] subspecies descended from the rulers of [[Ghol-Gan]]. They are usually smaller and less healthy than normal cyclopes, but retain greater foresight and can share their gift with others. Some oracular cyclopes are served and nurtured by worshippers, while others are kept as prisoners.
