> **Pukwudgies** are hunchbacked porcupine-like [[Monstrous humanoid|monstrous humanoids]] covered with [[Venom|venomous]], [[Necromantic|necromantic]] quills.



## Appearance

> Pukwudgies are slight creatures, weighing only thirty pounds while standing three-and-a-half feet tall.


## Abilities

> Pukwudgies know [[Spell|spells]] to animate corpses, turn invisible, and mask themselves from [[Magic/Divination|divination]]. They can speak [[Draconic]] and [[Infernal]] in addition to [[Taldane]]. They are stealthy, deceptive creatures knowledgeable in [[Magic|magic]] and religion and can take the form of a porcupine.
> Pukwudgies sometimes use their [[Zombie|zombie]] creations to distract and separate wanderers from a group, and their invisibility to strike suddenly with their necromantic quills.


## Ecology

> Thanks to their necromantic quills' ability to create zombies from creatures they kill and their magical ability to raise the dead, pukwudgies often keep company with [[Undead|undead]] creatures, preferably [[Animal|animals]]. While some work alone or in pairs, some pukwudgies form cults of up to 10 members.
> They avoid busy routes and large [[Humanoid|humanoid]] settlements, but menace small villages by stealing newborn infantsâ€”a delicacy to pukwudgiesâ€”and torching buildings.


## On Golarion

> Pukwudgies are elusive creatures but are known to inhabit forests and dark corners of the [[Inner Sea region]], including [[Varisia]], [[Numeria]], [[Irrisen]], [[Nidal]]'s [[Mindspin Mountains]], [[Andoran]]'s [[Verduran Forest]], and the [[Hold of Belkzen]].


## Known pukwudgies

> - Marigana, of the [[Sanos Forest]] in Varisia
> - Ungrist, of the [[Artrosa|Crone of Artrosa]]
> - Abroget, seneschal of the [[Dark Forest|Dark Forests]] Black Keep
