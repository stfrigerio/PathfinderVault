> **Deinotheriums** are relatives of [[Elephant|elephants]] with a far shorter temper than their docile cousins. Despite being herbivores, they can attack with little provocation, giving them a false reputation as predators. They are not particularly social [[Animal|animals]], unlike their elephant kin, and generally live in families consisting of a calf and its parents; the mother will defend the calf even once it is grown, but the father will leave to find a new mate once the calf has matured. A deinotherium stands 12 feet tall at the shoulder, measures 25 feet from trunk to tailÂ and weighs 30,000 pounds.
