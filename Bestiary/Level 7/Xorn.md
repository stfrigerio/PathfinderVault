> **Xorns** are three-legged, three-armed, and three-eyed natives of the [[Plane of Earth]] who come to the [[Material Plane]] in search of interesting metals and gemstones to consume.


## Ecology

> Xorns have a mutually predatory relationship with [[Rock troll|rock trolls]], another species that is both composed of and feeds upon gems and minerals, leading to ferocious clashes when groups of the two creatures encounter one another.


## On distant worlds

> Xorns can be found on any of the rocky [[Planet|planets]] or moons our the [[Solar system|solar system]] that contain gems or precious metals. They are particularly drawn to [[Bretheda|Brethedas]] crystalline moon of [[Dykon]].
