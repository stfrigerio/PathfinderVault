As long as the gift persists, the succubus can communicate telepathically with the target at any distance, see through the creature's senses, and target the creature with suggestion through the telepathic link. In addition, the creature uses an outcome one degree of success worse than it rolls on saving throws against the lust demon's suggestions. A humanoid can't have more than one profane gift at a time, and a succubus can't grant more than one profane gift at a time. Removing the gift requires an atone ritual. The succubus can remove the gift as a free action to give the recipient a permanent [[stupefied|stupefied 3]] condition. A 4th-level [[restoration]] spell is required to reduce this [[stupefied|stupefied]] condition by 1. A summoned succubus can't grant a profane gift."

> **Succubi** (singular: **succubus**) are a race of [[Demon|demons]], typically expressing a feminine form, infamous across the [[Great Beyond|planes]] for tempting mortal souls and engendering misery and destruction through their seductive manipulations. They are sometimes called **lust demons**.



## Associated sin

> Lust.


## Appearance

![[Succubus_MSH.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Succubi can take any form their victims prefer.
> A succubus, when in her natural form, resembles an incredibly beautiful and alluring [[Human|human]] woman, with a lithe figure and dangerously seductive features. Despite their comeliness, succubi possess several clearly demonic attributes, not the least of which are a pair of large, bat-like wings sprouting from their shoulders and sinuous, writhing tails. Of course, it is very rare that a succubus's victim actually sees this form as they are adept at shifting forms to become whatever their victims would find most attractive.


## Habitat and ecology

> Succubi dwell primarily in the depth of the [[Abyss]], particularly the [[Midnight Isles]], the layer ruled by their mother and patroness, [[Nocticula]]. Despite this, they are not uncommon on the [[Material Plane]] where they enjoy sowing chaos with their manipulations. Succubi savor the sweet taste of a mortal's life-force and possess the ability to drain it with their infamous soul-sucking kisses. Despite their relative physical weakness when compared with other demonic races such as [[Hezrou|hezrous]] or [[Glabrezu|glabrezus]], they can achieve very high ranks amongst the fiendish hierarchy thanks to their complex machinations, and many abyssal conflicts have started thanks to their subtle, scheming influences. Succubi tend to be created from the souls of particularly lustful and rapacious mortals, damned to the Abyss.
> The [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Nocticula]] is said to be the first succubus. She is worshipped by the succubi.
> Succubi are particularly hated by [[Gancanagh|gancanagh]] [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azatas]] who view them as profaning the very notion of romance, love, and companionship.


## On Golarion

> Succubi rule some of the petty fiefdoms of the [[Worldwound]], maintaining their power through manipulation rather than sheer force.
> A succubus named [[Avalexi]] operates a hidden shrine to [[Shax]] in [[Magnimar]], from which she strikes out against worshippers of [[Sarenrae]] in the city.


## On other celestial bodies

> Succubi led by [[Izmiara]], the Insatiable Queen, rule the [[Moonscar]] in Nocticula's name.


> [[Paizo]] published a sourcebook about demons called *[[Demons Revisited]]* which includes a chapter about succubi.
