> **Ebon acolyti**, also known as **altar golems**, are statues or altars animated to aid in the sacrifice of sentient creatures to bloodthirsty deities such as [[Rovagug]], [[Lamashtu]], [[Asmodeus]], or other [[God|divine]] or semi-divine beings. The most well-known altar golems include the Altar of Angazhan in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] and the [[Black Altar]] in the [[Midnight Temple]] of [[Egorian]], [[Cheliax]].


## Appearance

> Ebon acolyti are crafted from a single block of stone in the shape of a servant of the deity they are dedicated to, with a companion altar. Most are about 14 feet tall, weigh 2,500 pounds, and are armed with an enormous sacrificial [[Dagger|dagger]].


## Habitat and ecology

> Altar golems are usually found in a dark place of worship, where the secrecy of sacrifice is paramount. They are especially proficient in wrestling potential victims into sacrificial position and sacrificing them. [[Soul|Souls]] sacrificed by an ebon acolytus are especially difficult to resurrect, so [[Evil|evil]] priests have been known to sacrifice themselves on one to elude justice.
