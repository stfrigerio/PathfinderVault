> **Sceaduinars** (pronounced SKAY-doo-nahr), also known as the **Raptors of the Void**, are the dominant intelligent native species of the [[Negative Energy Plane]].



## Appearance

> Sceaduinars resemble spindly [[Gargoyle|gargoyles]] made of dark purple crystal. They stand about 7 feet tall and weigh around 100 pounds.


## Ecology

> Sceaduinars form spontaneously and fully grown from the geometrical errors in the crystalline knots in the Negative Energy Plane, where the [[Negative energy|negative energy]] concentration is greatest. Unlike nearly every creature in existence, their creation has nothing to do with [[Positive energy|positive energy]], and their [[Soul|soulstuff]] is made from negative energy. Due to their divorce from the [[Positive Energy Plane]], sceaduinars are completely incapable of creating anything. They can guide natural processes, like the growth of *spheres of annihilation*, but never truly invent.


## Habitat

> Sceaduinars shape cities of glass from the crystalline knots where they form. Lacking the ability to invent, sceaduinars have to plagiarise their architecture from the nearest non-sceaduinar settlements or ruins, and over time, their cities ironically always resemble those of their hated foes, despite their efforts to forge their own destiny.
> Although they are created from pure entropy, the areas near a sceaduinar's home are among the few places stable enough to sustain outside life.
> Sceaduinars can exist for extended periods outside their native Negative Energy Plane but find this uncomfortable. On the [[Material Plane]], sceaduinars guard the [[Portal|portals]] at the cores of [[Black hole|black holes]] that lead to the Negative Energy Plane.


## Society

> Sceaduinars cultivate *spheres of annihilation* from tree-like structures made of negative energy. These *spheres* are used as [[Weapon|weapons]] against [[Wraith|wraiths]] or sent drifting in the Negative Energy Plane, sometimes finding their way to other [[Plane|planes]].
> Due to the difference between them and creatures driven by positive energy, sceaduinars despise nearly every other creature in existence. [[Undead]] are viewed as abominable parasites feeding on the Negative Energy Plane's sublime entropy, and sceaduinars frequently send hunting parties to destroy them, something which they pursue with almost religious fervour. Sceaduinars despise [[Nightshade|nightshades]] despite their similar goals, but know that they are too powerful and avoid them if they cannot ensure victory in the inevitable battle.
> Sceaduinars hold an ancestral hatred for the [[Jyoti|jyoti]], their Positive Energy Plane counterparts. According to their lore, the two races used to be partners, tending the movement of positive and negative energy across the multiverse, until the jyoti and the [[Deity|deities]] in league with them betrayed the sceaduinars and shut their access to the Positive Energy Plane, depriving them of the ability to create. The [[Esoteric tradition|esoteric tradition]] rejects this story, believing that the Positive and Negative Energy Planes are still connected, and attributes this hatred to the sceaduinars' knowledge of destruction's role in the creation of [[Soul|souls]].
> [[Daemon|Daemons]] are interested in sceaduinars and the Negative Energy Plane, but all daemonic attempts to forge an alliance with sceaduinars have ended in bloodshed. Sceaduinars sometimes work alongside the equally anti-theistic [[Asura|asuras]], and some of them have made contact with squamous things from the [[Dark Tapestry]]. While [[Oblivion|oblivions]] usually form near sceaduinars' homes, they exhibit neither allegiance nor antipathy toward sceaduinars. Sceaduinars often employ [[Sceazir|sceazirs]], their bestial cousins, as mounts and beasts of burden, and can command them via [[Telepathy|telepathy]].
> Sceaduinars dream of a [[Great Beyond|multiverse]] dominated by negative energy life akin to themselves, and many plot to turn this vision into reality.


### Religion

> Sceaduinars reject all deities, considering them to be the jyoti's lackeys in imprisoning them in the Negative Energy Plane. A few worship the Negative Energy Plane, but are only rewarded with minor [[Cleric|clerical]] powers.


## Variants

> Sceaduinar **splinter twins** form from particularly bizarre crystalline aggregations that do not properly split into individual sceaduinars. They are bigger than normal sceaduinars, have two heads, many limbs, and other monstrous features.
