> **Daemon-spawn**, or **grimspawn** as they are sometimes called, is the name given to [[Tiefling|tieflings]] who are descended from [[Daemon|daemons]]. Grimspawn tend to find themselves unnaturally fascinated by [[Sickness|sickness]], decay, and death in all its many forms. Therefore, grimspawn can usually be found at the sights of epidemics, natural disasters, and war zones, such as: the flooded depths of the [[Sodden Lands]]; near the perpetual war zone at border of [[Nirmathas]] and [[Molthune]]; and bordering the festering [[Worldwound]]. Grimspawn tend to appear unnaturally thin, their skin sallow and their eyes often a dead, milky white. They also often bear what appear to be large festering wounds, although these injuries are only cosmetic. As a result of their general appearance, they are sometimes mistaken for actual [[Undead|undead]] creatures.
