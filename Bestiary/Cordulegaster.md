> **Cordulegasters** are [[Outsider|outsiders]] resembling dragonfly nymphs native to the [[River Styx]].



## Appearance

> A cordulegaster resembles a monstrous dragonfly nymph covered in a russet exoskeleton mimicking rock formations in the River Styx. Jagged spikes cover the cordulegaster's exoskeleton and run down its tail, making it dangerous to hold or eat. A secondary set of mandibles is nestled in the cordulegaster's mouth and normally covered by its prehensile inner jaw, which extends forward to pull in prey when it hunts. Cordulegasters can grow up to 12 feet long, 7 feet tall, and 2,000 pounds.


## History

> Cordulegasters are suspected to have been created by either [[Charon]] to keep trespassers from crossing the River Styx without paying Charon's toll, or from [[Trelmarixian|Trelmarixians]] experiments on tortured [[Soul|souls]] in the Weeping Tower.


## Ecology

> Originally from [[Abaddon]], cordulegasters primarily inhabit the River Styx, serving the ecological niche of semi-aquatic ambush predators like [[Crocodile|crocodiles]] on the [[Material Plane]]. They have also spread via the Styx to shallow, slow-moving waters, like the Bile Sluice and [[Plaguemere]] in Abaddon or [[Stygia]] in [[Hell]] (despite the lack of [[Daemon|daemons]] there). They often assist [[Hydrodaemon|hydrodaemons]] and [[Piscodaemon|piscodaemons]] in harvesting souls, and their bite is infused with the memory erasure of the River Styx.


## Variants

> Many cordulegaster populations have adapted to the conditions of their environment:

> - the **borderlands cordulegaster**, whose [[Anatomy|anatomy]] constantly shifts due to the influence of the [[Maelstrom]]
> - the **planar swamp cordulegaster**, which inhabits swamps such as the [[Plaguemere]] and can no longer erase foes' memories, but has gained immunity to [[Poison|poison]] or [[Disease|disease]]
> - the **elder cordulegaster**, which has dwelt long enough in the River Styx to learn how to consume souls, becoming a daemon
