> A **penanggalen** (sometimes spelled **penanggalan**) is an especially horrific species of [[Vampire|vampire]] found primarily in the lands of [[Vudra]]. Appearing as a beautiful woman by day, the head and organs of a penanggalen separate from its body by night as it flies through the air in search of victims. The head must soak its organs in a solution of vinegar in order to squeeze itself back onto its body before daybreak.


## Creation

> Although the creation of a penanggalen varies, it always involves terrible acts of violence and bloodletting, typically involving tortured victims.
