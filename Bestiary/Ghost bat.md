> The pale **ghost bats** native to the [[Land of Black Blood]] and other parts of the [[Darklands]] typically sate themselves upon large insects and other [[Vermin|vermin]], though in their swarms they have been known to attack larger prey. Possessing transparent wings and no hairâ€”just white fleshâ€”these small hunters sometimes grow to shocking sizes.
