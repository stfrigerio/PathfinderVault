> The **Black Altar** is an [[Ebon acolytus|altar golem]] in the [[Midnight Temple]] of [[Asmodeus]] in [[Egorian]], [[Cheliax]]. The altar resembles a [[Bestiary/Devil|devil]] with large wings and horns. The sacrifice of nine [[Slave|slaves]] are made to the [[Deity|deity]] at midnight on the first day of every ninth week. The wings close around the sacrifice to hide the killing blow, and no corpse remains when they open.
