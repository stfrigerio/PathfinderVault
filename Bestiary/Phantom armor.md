> A **phantom armor** is animated by the [[Soul|souls]] of combatants slain in an act of betrayal or treachery. They seek vengeance against their killers if they can, and battle with any living foes if not. A [[Necromancer|necromancer]] might also create a phantom armor by binding violent souls to suits of [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]].


## Appearance

> Phantom armors are as diverse as armor itselfâ€”they can be animated helms, suits of armor, lancers, or giant in size.
