> **Merfolk** (**mermaid** *f.* and **merman** *m.*), called **sapiaquali-oths** in the language of their [[Alghollthu|alghollthu]] creators, are amphibious [[Humanoid|humanoids]] encountered in the temperate waters and coastlines of the [[Inner Sea region]]. A merfolk's torso resembles that of a [[Human|human]] or [[Elf|elf]], while their lower bodies are dominated by a [[Fish|fish-like]] tail and fins. They are highly xenophobic, and commonly attack members of other races that encroach upon their territory; the only other intelligent creatures merfolk consider allies are the alghollthus.



## Appearance

> From the waist up, a merfolk's body resembles that of a human, though their features and build are usually more elven in appearance; members of others races sometimes experience feelings of desire due to the attractiveness of a merfolk's upper body. A merfolk's lower body, however, is comprised of a scaled tail and fins similar to that of a giant fish. Female merfolk are generally smaller in size than their male counterparts, but members of the race tend to weigh an average of over 200 pounds and measure between six and eight feet in length.
> The hair and scales of merfolk can come in a wide range of colors and hues. Despite the potential variety in the race's appearance, merfolk in shared habitats tend to boast similar pigmentation.


## Ecology

> Merfolk are naturally adapted to life underwater, but they are amphibious creatures; merfolk can breathe both in and out of the water. They are even capable of traversing short distances across land, though these journeys are rare, and merfolk tend stay relatively close to their aquatic homes. Merfolk favor temperate waters, and can be found in the coastal and deeper regions of the [[Arcadian Ocean|Arcadian]] and [[Obari Ocean|Obari oceans]], as well as the [[Inner Sea|Inner]] and [[Steaming Sea|Steaming seas]].
> [[Cyclops|cyclopes]] are known to enjoy feasting on merfolk flesh: the cyclopes of [[Butcher's Rock|Butchers Rock]] were even willing to trade a valuable prisoner for delicious merfolk flesh, which is said to have a fishy flavour.


### Deep merfolk

***Main article: [[Deep merfolk]]***
> Merfolk kin adapted to extreme underwater depths are known as [[Deep merfolk|deep merfolk]]. These merfolk have dark transparent skin and hunt along the depths of ocean trenches.


## History

> The sapiaquali-oths were the result of the alghollthus' first attempt to create humanoids. However, they were quickly forgotten and left alone by their creators, who moved on to other experiments and began interfering in terrestrial societies. The merfolk have forgotten about their origin, but are instinctively xenophobic and prevent intruders from entering certain deep places of the oceans for reasons they do not fully understandâ€”these are actually remnants of the instincts imprinted by the alghollthus in the distant past.


## Society

> The merfolk race is highly xenophobic; they generally shelter themselves in hidden communities, fiercely protecting the territory they hold from outsiders. Merfolk are especially distrusting of surface races, and go to great lengths to conceal their presence from those that live primarily on land. As a result, most merfolk settlements remain unknown to those on the surface, and encounters between merfolk and surface dwellers are uncommon. It is partially due to the infrequent sightings of merfolk that their presence is sometimes considered an ill omen by sailors.
> Merfolk xenophobia extends below the waves as well. Though merfolk will keep aquatic [[Animal|animals]] for the purposes of companionship, they generally isolate themselves from other aquatic races. The sole exception to this distrust are the fish-like [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aberration|aberrations]] known as alghollthus; many merfolk serve [[Alghollthu master|alghollthu masters]], sometimes willingly.

> In addition to the settlements listed below, merfolk can also be found among the undersea canyons of the doomed continent of [[Azlant]].

[[Chosovosei]]
Chosovosei is a small, by surface standards, merfolk city located in a trench in the Steaming Sea. They peacefully coexist with the the elves of the [[Mordant Spire]], also located in this region, but are forced to make offerings to placate the [[Kraken|krakens]] of the Endless Eye.
Jehyseel
Located in the Obari Ocean, the city of Jehyseel is protected by a forest of deadly stinging anemones.
[[Outsea]]
While not an exclusively merfolk-inhabited city, they comprise a plurality of this amphibious [[River Kingdoms]] city.
Stormshoal
Stormshoal is a merfolk settlement that floats beneath the waters along the edge of the [[Eye of Abendego]]. This isolated fortress is composed of coral and stone, and anchored in place by gigantic seaweed fronds. Native merfolk live in near isolation, the surrounding area made dangerous by the stormy waters of the Eye. 

## On other planes

> Merfolk have emigrated to the [[Plane of Water]], where they live in seclusion in dimly lit seas. They use [[Illusion|illusion]] magic and other mundane techniques to hide their homes, often to the annoyance of travelers and the plane's other inhabitants. Several tribes live within the [[Jungle of Worms]], using it as shelter from the dangers of the plane's open oceans.
