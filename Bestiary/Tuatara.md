> **Tuataras** are small, rare primordial cousins of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Lizard|lizards]] that evolved in the absence of mammals.



## Habitat and ecology

> Most tuataras live on isolated islands and are nearly extinct on [[Golarion|Golarions]] surface. Variants are more common in the [[Darklands]], however. Some serve as [[Familiar|familiars]] for [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]], and as exotic creatures were sometimes favored familiars for [[Arclords of Nex]].


## Known tuataras

> - Kolo, spirit animal of [[Shardra Geltl]]
> - Regalia, once owned by Nadine Vives of the [[Forae Logos]] in [[Absalom]]

## Variants

> [[Rock tuatara|Rock tuataras]], sometimes called deep crag tuataras, are the most common underground species of tuatara and plentiful in [[Nar-Voth]], where their camouflage has adapted to cave walls and rocks.
> Spined **flute tuataras** hide among [[Fungus|fungal growths]], **mossy tuataras** are named for their tendency to sleep underwater for so long that moss grows on them, and **viper tuataras** have a [[Venom|venomous]] bite.
