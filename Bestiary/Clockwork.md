*This article is about the [[Construct|construct]] subtype. For creatures that have been described generically as clockworks, see [[Robot|robot]]. For other mechanical creatures or animated contraptions, see [[Automaton|automaton]] and [[Golem|golem]]. For the construct-like race sometimes confused with clockworks, see [[Android|android]].*
> A **clockwork** creature is a complex mechanical [[Construct|construct]] with an external power source. Many clockworks are built to resemble living creatures and mimic their abilities.



## Power

> Unlike standard constructs created purely via [[Magic|magic]], clockworks do not require the creator to bind an [[Elemental|elemental]] [[Spirit|spirit]] or [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Soul|soul]] to give it power and motion. Instead, most clockworks rely on some form of winding mechanism that must be turned on a regular basis in order to animate the construct. After being wound, often with a unique key, the construct can go about its duties until it runs out of energy. Once that happens, the construct becomes little more than an inanimate object (albeit a very complex one), that can remain in this dormant state for centuries before it is wound again and returns to "life". The mundane source of their power makes clockworks the preferred creations of those who find the harvesting of a creature's life force to be distasteful or [[Evil|evil]].


## Structure

> Unlike the much more solid and durable [[Golem|golems]], clockworks are filled with springs, cogs, gears, and other delicate mechanical devices, making them more susceptible to damage. Electricity, in particular, can be devastating to the internal workings of such a construct.


## On Golarion

> The [[Technology|technological understanding]] to build clockwork devices was first developed over 10,000 years ago in [[Azlant]], and later perfected in [[Thassilon]]. Even though [[Earthfall]] destroyed most examples of their work, a few constructs survived the apocalypse, leading to the rediscovery of the art thousands of years later. Because clockworks are so much more time-consuming to develop and create than more standard [[Magic|magical]] constructs, they remain somewhat of a curiosity of the rich.
> One of the centers of clockwork technology in the [[Inner Sea region]] is the [[Clockwork Cathedral]] in [[Absalom]]. The craftsmen and [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] who work here continuously strive to improve their creations, often infusing them with magic in order to lessen the need for external sources of power.  The best-regarded modern work on clockwork design and construction is *The Glorious Rhythms in Life and Mechanica*, by Professor Hadia Al-Dannah, a [[Qadira|Qadiran]] [[Mathematician|mathematician]] and former scholar at the Clockwork Cathedral.
