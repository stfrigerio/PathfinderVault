> **Margays** are small, spotted [[Cat|cats]] that inhabit the canopies of rainforests. They have long tails that make up half their body length, and are occasionally taken as [[Familiar|familiars]] by [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]].


## Ecology

> Margays live in the treetops of tropical forests, where they hunt smaller [[Animal|animals]] such as [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Monkey|monkeys]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Frog|frogs]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Lizard|lizards]]. They are nocturnal animals, hunting by night and sleeping during the day in a tangle of lianas. They have the ability to accurately mimic the sounds made by other animals, which they use when hunting to lure potential prey into ambushes.
