> **Snowcaster half-elves**, or **Snowborn** as they are sometimes called in [[Human|human]] settlements, are [[Half-elves|half-elves]] descended from [[Ilverani]], most frequently when [[Twilight speaker|twilight speaker]] envoys from Snowcaster tribes commingle with humans. Such liaisonsâ€”which occur most often in [[Jadwiga]], [[Ulfen]], and [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] communitiesâ€”result in the twilight speaker and their Snowborn children being cast out of their Snowcaster tribe in shame. [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] [[Winter witch|winter witches]] especially pursue Snowcasters, hoping to empower their bloodlines with magic by bearing a Snowborn child.
> Their distinct frost-white skin and elven features set them apart in the human settlements where they're raised and ostracize them in less tolerant societies. Few Snowborn gain the same rights as humans within their homelands.
