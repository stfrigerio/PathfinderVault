> The blue, heifer-sized giant **scarab beetle** is native to the desert lands of [[Osirion]], where it can be found among the country's many tombs and necropolises. Because of this, it is often associated with death.
> **Scarab swarms** are thousands of the burrowing [[Beetle|beetles]] still covered in dung, which is the normal food of the individual scarab beetle. Followers of [[Pharasma]] might view the appearance of a scarab swarm as a bad omen, and some people even believe that the swarms are drawn to the same [[Negative energy|negative energy]] that causes [[Undead|undead]] to rise.
