> The **peafowl** is a species of pheasant. Males, known as **peacocks**, have bright, iridescent feathers that they display to scare off predators and to court more plainly adorned females, called **peahens**. The colourful eye patterns on their feathers also make them popular among fortune tellers and royalty as symbols and decorations. A typical peafowl is three and a half feet tall and weighs about ten pounds. Some cultures also breed white peafowl.
