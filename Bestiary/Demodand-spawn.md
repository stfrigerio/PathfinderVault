> **Demodand-spawn**, or **foulspawn** as they are sometimes called, is the name given to [[Tiefling|tieflings]] who are descended from [[Demodand|demodands]]. In appearance, foulspawn normally have one revoltingly exaggerated feature that makes them repulsive, such as skin that hangs in sagging folds, or sweat like that of a [[Tarry demodand|tarry demodand]], and they tend to have a lumbering gait. Foulspawn have personalities that seem drawn to heresy and their shrill voices seem suited to spouting blasphemies. Foulspawn are most common in and around the wastelands of the [[Worldwound]].
