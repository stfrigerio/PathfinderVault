> **Monstrous humanoids** are well described in that they have much similarity with regular [[Humanoid|humanoids]], such as [[Human|humans]], [[Elf|elves]], or [[Dwarf|dwarves]]. However, they exhibit monstrous features and sometimes strange [[Magic|magical]] abilities not found in average humanoids.
