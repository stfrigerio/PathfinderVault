> Fierce [[Undead|undead]] designed as [[Cheliax|Chelish]] weapons of war, the **sea-sworn** are fierce opponents on the ocean but quickly crumble into dust when on land. 



## Appearance

> Sea-sworn appear much like whatever creature they were originally with a few exceptions. Their skin looks more frog-like than before and drips with brackish sea water. Any hands and feet become webbed to improve its swimming, and any facial features become blunted and less defined. Sea-sworn were most often created from Chelish marines, so the most common sea-sworn appear as [[Human|humans]] with these traits. Due to their need for constant immersion in sea water, sea-sworn are often covered with ocean detritus like seaweed and barnacles. Their smell also reflects their ocean-dwelling nature as they stink of brine and muddy tidal flats.


## Habitat and ecology

> Sea-sworn always dwell in salt water, usually the ocean. Due to their nature, if they are taken out of this environment sea-sworn quickly wither to nothing. The only exception is their ability to stay on a boat as long as the boat is on salt water, allowing the sea-sworn to attack ships and making them a feared part of [[Chelish Navy|Cheliaxs naval force]] loathed by Andoran's navy.
> As undead, their ecology is wholly unnatural; they have little impact on their surrounding environment as they do not need to eat. Sea-sworn are created within living memory by Chelish [[Necromancer|necromancers]] to serve as a potent addition to Cheliax's navy. Even a small group of sea-sworn is more than capable of overwhelming an enemy ship. To curb the power of these potent warriors, the necromancers of Cheliax added the withering curse should they leave the oceans' salty embrace.


## Abilities

> The touch of a sea-sworn fills its victim's lungs with sea water, slowly drowning them.
> Contact with salt water provides a supernatural restorative power, allowing the sea-sworn to rapidly recover from injuries.
