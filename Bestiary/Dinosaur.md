> **Dinosaurs** are powerful, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Lizard|lizard-like]] [[Animal|animals]]. Many tower to gigantic sizes.



## In Golarion

> Dinosaurs are believed to have originated in the vault of [[Deep Tolguth]] in the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Orv]]. They continue to thrive there, as well as in the region of [[Tolguth]] on the surface world, in the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]].
> There may once have been a link between Deep Tolguth and Tolguth, presumably via the [[Earthnavel]], which allowed the dinosaurs to migrate up to the surface. If so, these tunnels have long since collapsed.
> Dinosaurs can also be found in other remote areas of [[Golarion]], such as the [[Mwangi Expanse]].
> The largest dinosaurs have little to fear from most non-dinosaurs, but are a favourite food source for [[Froghemoth|froghemoths]].
> The [[Thunderscale]] tribe of [[Kobold|kobolds]], which lives in the jungles of [[Mediogalti]], revere their local dinosaurs as [[Deity|gods]]. They engage in extremely dangerous religious rituals. Captive dinosaurs are released amongst members of the tribe; those kobolds who manage to survive the experience are considered to be blessed. Many [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] also revere dinosaurs, and some even believe themselves to be descended from dinosaurs. Lizardfolk sometimes keep dinosaurs as beasts of war or burden, or else allow them to roam free about their settlements.
