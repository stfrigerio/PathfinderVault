 Zepha, a [[Preceptor archon|preceptor archon]].
> **Archons** are a race of [[Celestial|celestials]] native to [[Heaven]] who embody fundamental [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|goodness]] and [[Law|law]]. Archons were once [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Soul|souls]], and form the mainstay of Heaven's eternal war against the forces of the [[Abyss]], [[Abaddon]], and [[Hell]]. They are also protectors of the good and innocent.



## Appearance

> Archons have no uniform shapes: some look like winged [[Humanoid|humanoids]], others are [[Animal|animalistic]] or resemble objects. The uninitiated might have trouble recognising archons as a single group.


## Ecology

> Archons typically arise through three fashions: created by Heavenly [[Deity|deities]], transformed from [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]], or emerging from Heaven's [[Quintessence|quintessence]]. They rise up through the ranks of the celestial hierarchy, modeling their progress after the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] mountain of Heaven. They are first transformed from goodly souls into [[Lantern archon|lantern archons]], but can ascend all the way up to the most powerful [[Star archon|star archons]]. From the start, these souls are helped by more powerful mentors to indulge their desire to see goodness and honesty spread across the [[Multiverse|multiverse]], but particularly the [[Material Plane]].


## Habitat

> Archons build symmetrical, sturdy fortresses on the mountain of Heaven that shine as if just constructed, but can stand for aeons. Surrounding these fortresses are cultivated farmlands and orderly settlements. Because of their tendency to bring the fight to the enemy, archon fortresses can also be found outside of Heaven.


## Society

> Archons understand that when [[Chaos|chaos]] and [[Evil|evil]] threaten to take over the multiverse, individual desires should be set aside for the greater good. Although sometimes denounced as authoritarian zealots, archons are usually compassionate with fellow good beings and tolerate even [[Lawful evil|lawful evil]] creatures, only viewing those that follow neither law nor good as irredeemable. In Heaven, they are committed to training petitioners, but also take joy in their friends and work.
> Described as ideal soldiers, archons easily organise among themselves, each recognising its strength and playing its designated role without complaint.
> Archons prefer to motivate mortals to acts of virtue and honour, reasoning that this way, when the next threat comes, the mortals will be better prepared to combat it themselves, and know that hasty action might do more harm than good, as their foes often use mortals as bait. Archons often disguise themselves as goodly [[Knight|knights]], of the sort found in legends, in order to inspire those around them. Against direct incarnations of evil, like [[Demon|demons]] and [[Devil|devils]], their actions are less subtle, charging headlong into battle, often in armies thousands strong. During these battles, the armies of Heaven act with honour, but they are not foolish, and do not sacrifice themselves unnecessarily; archon commanders never send their men into battle without a specific goal in mind.
> While archons are paragons of goodness, they have little patience for those who do not follow their strict moral guidelines. To an archon, a cruel tyrant does not justify rioting and rebellion to overthrow him; justice and the law must not be abandoned for the sake of goodness otherwise, without justice and the law, goodness cannot prosper. This approach unfortunately sometimes draws them into violent conflict with the [[PathfinderWiki/Culture/Races/Azata|azatas]], even though archons dislike opposing their goodly brethren. Archons prefer to work with their own kind, and follow the cues of the greatest archons and [[Lawful good|lawful]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lords]] when they cannot decide what to do.
> Archons often cooperate with [[Axiomite|axiomites]] and devils in crusades against demons and [[Protean|proteans]] alike, but do not trust them as they trust their fellow celestials.


## Language

> Archons uniformly speak [[Celestial language|Celestial]], but can also converse in [[Draconic]] and [[Infernal]]. They also possess an ability called [[Truespeech|truespeech]], which allows them to communicate with any intelligent creature that has a [[Language|language]].
