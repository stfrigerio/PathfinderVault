> **Oozes** are a classification of simple, strange mutable creatures usually existing in an amorphous state. Despite their appearance, they are not necessarily primitive creatures; however, most are basic life forms with low intelligence and little more than an instinct to feed. In [[Darklands slang]], oozes are called **sloppers**.
