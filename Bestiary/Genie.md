> A **genie** (also known as *jinni*, plural *jinn*) is an [[Outsider|outsider]] native to one of the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]], and often composed primarily of [[Element|elemental]] material. The five best known races of genies are [[Djinn|djinn]] (of [[Plane of Air|elemental air]]), [[Efreet|efreet]] (of [[Plane of Fire|elemental fire]]), [[Marid|marid]] (of [[Plane of Water|elemental water]]), [[Shaitan|shaitan]] (of [[Plane of Earth|elemental earth]]), and [[Janni|jann]] (composed of all four elements, and native to the [[Material Plane]]). Other, lesser genie races exist, including the diminutive [[Zhyen|zhyen]] and malignant [[Black jinn|black jinn]]. **Geniekind** is a term used to describe the plethora of genies.



## History

> Genies are said to have come into being with the first act of creation. Their own stories call them "the first people", claiming that their suffering at the claws of [[Rovagug]] was the start of the war between him and the other [[Deity|gods]].
> Concurrent with the creation of the genies, the dark demigod [[Ahriman]] came into existence as the genies' destructive shadow. Ahriman hates the genies with ever fiber of his being. He created the corrupt [[Div|divs]] from the [[Soul|souls]] of [[Evil|evil]] genies to bedevil them.
> Early in their history, before [[Mortal|mortals]] were created, many genies of all races were enslaved by the godlike tyrant [[Iblis]], and the struggle to obtain and keep their freedom was the only time the warring genie races ever joined forces against a common foe.


## Ecology

> Unlike most outsiders, genies are born in the manner of mortals, usually in sets of twins or triplets, or even in litters of up to eight. They grow much faster than mortals, reaching adulthood at the age of six (for efreet or djinn) to fifteen (for jann). The power of a genie is often linked to its physical size, with the oldest and/or most powerful being the largest.
> Most genies, save the nomadic jann, live decadent lives in opulent palaces or cities on the elemental planes; the most magnificent are the [[Opaline Vault]] of the shaitan and the efreet's [[City of Brass]].
> Genies are effectively immortal, immune to the ravages of time and old age. When struck down by violence, a genie's body evaporates, dissolves, or crumbles into its constituent elements. Upon its death, a genie's soul is reabsorbed into the elemental plane of its birth and reincarnated into a new body. However, some genies meet a terrible fate as an undead [[Ghul|ghul]] or [[Edimmu|edimmu]], and the most evil of all genies' souls find their way to [[Abaddon]] and are transfigured into [[Div|divs]].


## Interactions with mortals

> Many genies can grant wishes to those who bind them, best them, or earn from them a favor. However, it is widely held that one must be very wary of the wording used in such a wish. When dealing with genies, the saying "be careful what you wished for" takes on a life and death meaning.
> On [[Golarion]], genies have had the most interaction with the [[Human|humans]] of southern [[Casmaron]] and northern [[Garund]]. There even exist rumors that the [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshites]] first gained the knowledge of agriculture and other building blocks of civilization from genies. The [[Empire of Kelesh|Padishah Empire of Kelesh]] binds them for all manner of purposes, and the master genie binder [[Sulesh|Sulesh the Great]] was a Keleshite. Likewise, the great maharajah [[Khiben-Sald]] of [[Vudra]] bound a veritable army of marids to his will. In the [[Inner Sea region]], they are most commonly encountered in [[Qadira]], the westernmost [[Satrap|satrapy]] of [[Kelesh]], and on the island-nation of [[Jalmeray]], although there are rumors that in [[Katapesh]] they are infused into the very land itself.


### Genie kin

***Main article: [[Geniekin]]***
> Genies are able to breed with mortals, giving rise to the races collectively known as genie kin. [[Ifrit|Ifrits]] are the result of unions with efreet, [[Oread|oreads]] with shaitan, [[Sylph|sylphs]] with djinn, [[Undine|undines]] with marids, and [[Suli|suli]] with jann. Geniekin are most commonly encountered in Qadira.
