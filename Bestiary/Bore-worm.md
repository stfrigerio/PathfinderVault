*For another meaning of "Bore-worm", please see [[Bore worm]].*
> **Bore-worms** are tiny, colorless invertebrates that crawl through the blue polar ice of the [[Crown of the World]]. These humble scavengers feed on lichen and microorganisms and, in turn, are eaten by the amphibian [[Novosi|novosis]]. [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] hunters use bore-worms as bait when "fishing" for novosis.
