> **Undead** are [[Mortal|once-living]] creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces, chiefly [[Negative energy|negative energy]] or [[Evil|evil]] [[Magic|magic]] that corrupted a recently departed [[Soul|soul]]. Undead can be of a simple mindless type, such as [[Skeleton|skeletons]] or [[Zombie|zombies]], or [[Deity|quasideities]] such as the most powerful [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|liches]]. Colloquially, undead may be referred to a the **walking dead**.

### In the Inner Sea region

> Creating and transporting undead creatures is illegal in most nations of the [[Inner Sea region]] (with [[Geb's Rest]] being the most prominent exception). The state of undeath is considered a severe moral crime as it violates both a person's body and [[Soul|soul]].
> A network of smugglers attempts to circumvent these prohibitions, however, as the mindless undead make for tireless and inexpensive unskilled laborers; a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] [[Skeleton|skeleton]] can cost as little as 45 [[Gold piece|gold pieces]]. Such black-market undead are typically created by profiteering [[Arcane|arcane]] [[Necromancer|necromancers]] rather than those that already serve cults or worshipers of [[Evil|evil]] [[Deities|deities]], or hard-to-control spontaneously created undead.


### Necrografting

> The practice of **necrografting**, also illegal outside of Geb, replaces living body parts or organs with those of undead bodies, often to grant the recipient some of the donor's physical or supernatural abilitiesâ€”or more nefariously, to warp the unwilling in horrific experiments.
