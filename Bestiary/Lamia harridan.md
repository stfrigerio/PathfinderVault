> **Lamia harridans** are the highest strata of [[Lamyros|lamyros]] society, higher even than the [[Lamia matriarch|lamia matriarchs]] who rule many tribes of the weaker [[Lamia|lamia]]. While they are the highest strata, they are also by far the rarest of their family. Only lamias and lamia matriarchs (never [[Kuchrima|kuchrimas]] or [[Hungerer|hungerers]]) can become lamia harridans.


## Appearance

> Lamia harridans appear very similar to normal lamia, just much larger. Lamia harridans have the four-legged lower body of a massive hunting [[Cat|cat]], usually a [[Dire lion|dire lion]], from the waist down. From the waist up, they have the body of a beautiful [[Giant|giantess]], often covered in jewellery or henna tattoosâ€”anything that they feel will enhance their beauty. Harridans' bodies are normally about twenty feet long and are so large they weigh upwards of 6,000 pounds.


## Habitat & Ecology

> Lamia harridans are a rarity amongst the lamia species. They occur only once in every 500 births but are born to lead their people. Those who survive to maturity in a tribe of lamia, that is not already led by a harridan, are almost guaranteed to rise to lead the tribe. Harridans have long life spans living to be up to 500 years old. Harridans, unlike most lamia, are religious. They do not pay the [[Deity|gods]] any more than lip service themselves but insist upon fanatical devotion from their followers.
