*See also: [[Suli]]Â and [[Janni|janni]]*
> Children of burning passions consummated with mysterious desert travellers, **half-jann**â€”as with many half breedsâ€”do not belong entirely to either of their parents' worlds.



## Appearance

> The appearance of a half-janni is normally so close to a [[Human|humans]] that it is impossible to tell from a cursory glance that they share a different parentage, although they are always exceptionally beautiful for humans. It is only on closer inspection that people notice the otherworldly grace, serenity, and small cloud of sand that often dances around one's feet.


## Society

> Half-jann who adopt human culture tend to remain on the outside, keeping themselves on the fringe of civilisation so they never become too tangled up in its webs. Like their [[Genie|genie]] parent, however, they tend to find themselves inexorably drawn towards humans and often sire [[Suli|suli-jann]] themselves.
> Many never know a life outside of human communities as half-jann are normally born to human mothers left behind by the wandering janni. A half-janni who follows their full janni parent is always aware of their differences, for unlike the janni, they are [[Mortal|mortal]] (although they age more slowly than humans). Half-jann also must eat, unlike true janni, and while half-jann can rely on their parent's ability to [[Magic|magically]] create food, most make it a point of pride to be able to hunt and forage for themselves. Some suspect half-jann who choose a life in exile or amongst humans do so to prove their independence and self-reliance.
> Half-jann are emotionally closer to humans than their flighty genie kin, but they are always aware of their superiority to full humans. This self-superiority comes not just from their slow aging and beauty but also their innate magical abilities. As they grow in power, half-jann gain access to the magical abilities that normal jann have from birth.


## On Golarion

> Half-jann naturally belong to neither the civilisations of the [[Janni|janni]] or the [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]] humans they most commonly take as mates. Half-jann attempt to fit into either parent's culture as they are too few in number to form their own society.
> The largest concentration of half-jann is in the tent city of Erukh, where they dwell alongside their genie relatives.
