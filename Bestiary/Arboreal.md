> **Arboreals** are intelligent, sentient [[Plant|plant]] creatures who nurture and defend forests in an almost parental manner.



## Appearance

> Arboreals resemble [[Humanoid|humanoid]]-shaped trees and plants. Their typically slow movement belies a deceptive speed when endangered. They can vary widely in size, with the largest known to grow to 30 feet in height and 2 feet in trunk diameter, and weighing 4,500 pounds.


## Habitat

> Most arboreals remain close to their home forests, though some, such as the [[Arboreal warden|wardens]] of their kind, wander carefully alone or in groups known as "copses". The grandest among them are known as [[Arboreal regent|arboreal regents]], or "treants", who guard a single forest.


## Society

> Arboreals are long-lived creatures who take a long view of life and history, and rarely meddle in the affairs of short-lived [[Mortal|mortals]]. They tend to act only to protect themselves and the forests under their care from harm. Likewise, many are solitary outside of times of crisis, or meet in communal groups known as "groves" to share knowledge; the largest meetings occur only under the most serious of circumstances, when a region's groves meet for months at a time to plan action against an especially large threat.
> Older regents and powerful arboreals have access to the [[Fungus|fungi]] that connect trees within a forest, and can use this connection to sense danger far from their current location.
