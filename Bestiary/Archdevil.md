 [[Baalzebul]], an archdevil.
> **Archdevils**, also known as **archfiends**, are the nine major [[Devil|devils]] who rule the nine layers of [[Hell]]. Eight of them are [[Demigod|demigods]] who posses god-like powers (such as the ability to grant spells to their worshipers), but are less powerful than the master of Hell, [[Asmodeus]], who is a true [[Deity|god]]. The others pay strict obeisance to him. Each archdevil represents a different form of punishment for sinful mortals.



## Churches

> Though they are each worshiped individually or as a group on [[Golarion]], organized cults are rare outside of [[Cheliax]]. Those who do venerate an individual archdevil are generally lone cultists who on the surface are normal members of society, while also maintaining small, hidden shrines.
