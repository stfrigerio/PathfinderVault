![[First_World.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 The First World, home of the Eldest.
> No beings rule the [[Chaotic|chaotic]] and changeable [[Plane|plane]] known as the [[First World]], the home of the [[Fey|fey]], but its most powerful residents are the mighty beings known as the **Eldest**, sometimes known as the **fey-lords** or the **shapers**. They each pursue their own mysterious goals, and have little interest in the doings of lesser creatures. All command great respect or fear from the other inhabitants of that strange realm, and as [[Demigod|demigods]] can grant [[Spell|spells]] to their worshipers.



## Powers

> The Eldest are extremely adept at moulding the substance of the First World to their will, so their domains are oases of stability on that constantly changing planeâ€”albeit oases that move around with their masters.


## History

![[Jabberwock.jpg|left+hmed]] 
 The infamous [[Jabberwock]], one of the Tane.
> The Eldest were responsible for creating the fearsome living weapons known as the [[Tane]], and could unleash them once more should they feel the need to do so.


## Eldest known to Golarion

> [[Golarion]] has only felt the influence of the nine Eldest whose realms are, or were, coterminous with this particular part of the [[Material Plane]].

> - [[Count Ranalc]]
> - [[The Green Mother]]
> - [[Imbrex|Imbrex the Twins]]
> - [[The Lantern King]]
> - [[The Lost Prince]]
> - [[Magdh]]
> - [[Ng|Ng the Hooded]]
> - [[Ragadahn|Ragadahn the Water Lord]]
> - [[Shyka|Shyka the Many]]

## Other Eldest

> In addition to the aforementioned nine, there are also many Eldest spread across the infinite First World, Eldest of past ages, or those whose realms lie so far beyond Golarion that contact is rare, including:

> - [[Apholine]]
> - [[Enchar]]
> - Oleron
> The father of all [[Linnorm|linnorms]], mighty [[Fafnheir]], claims that he only left the First World after slaying three of the Eldest at some point in the misty depths of pre-history.
> Thousands of years ago, another Eldest, whose name has since been forgotten, attracted the wrath of [[Pharasma]] by siphoning part of the [[River of Souls]]; in return, he was plucked from the First World into the [[Boneyard]] to serve the Lady of Graves for an eternity.
> The body of the Bonefather, another of the Tane, is said to house the remains of three Eldest.
> In the Yara Waste, one can find the way to the Tomb of Karumaq, a former Eldest of cold and ice.


> Eldest are described in *[[The First World Realm of the Fey]]*.
