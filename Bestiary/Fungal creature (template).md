> A **fungal creature** is an intelligent [[Fungal|fungal]] [[Plant|plant]] that grows from a deceased creature. It retains many of the abilities, but none of the memories, of its host.
> Their formation and capabilities baffle many scholars, who suggest that fungal creatures so perfectly reproduce their host's inner workings that they also recreate its mind, but lack the corpse's former mortal essence containing its memories. Many are contemplative creatures except when in the presence of other living creatures it can kill and seed with its reproductive spores.
