> A **drake** is a degenerate, cruel, and [[Evil|evil]] cousin of the [[True dragon|true dragons]]. Drakes share many traits with true dragonsâ€”they have sturdy leathery wings, reptilian forms, dangerous breath, and the [[Language|ability to speak]]â€”but have two legs instead of a true dragon's four and lack their greater intelligence. A pack of drakes is called a rampage.



## Ecology

> Drakes reach reproductive maturity earlier than true dragons do, and are consequently more common. Drakes breed every five years, laying clutches of eggs that must be incubated for three to six weeks under specific conditions particular to each drake species. Drake hatchlings imprint on the first creature they see, and reach maturity after two years.


## Habitat and society

> Drakes are typically less intelligent than true dragons, though they are intelligent enough to use [[Language|language]], reason with others, and make deals with other races. However, they lack the patience, diplomacy, and long-term planning of their greater relatives, making them more prone to violence.
> Very rarely, drakes form strong bonds with other intelligent beings, with whom they become companions. Such drakes typically refer to their partners as their "charges", as they refuse to name any other being as their master. These bonds typically form after years spent by the other party winning the drake's trust. Due to both the time necessary to forge this bond and the rarity of drakes capable or willing to become another being's companion, these drakes are typically viewed as irreplaceable by their charges.


### Species of drake

> Drakes come in many species and have adapted to live in many environments.
> [[Wyvern|Wyverns]] are often considered to be a type of drake. Although they exhibit a number of differences from most drake types, they also show a noticeable degree of deference and collegial behavior towards one another.
> While [[Pseudodragon|pseudodragons]] are often called house drakes, they are not considered part of the drake family. Some [[Primal dragon|primal dragons]], such as [[Brine dragon|brine dragons]] and [[Crystal dragon|crystal dragons]], are sometimes referred to as drakes, perhaps due to their [[Element|elemental]] nature rather than being adapted true dragons.


## On Golarion

> Thanks to the many adaptations and species of drakes, few parts of [[Golarion]] are devoid of their presence. Drakes are often viewed by [[Humanoid|humanoid]] races as pestsâ€”though especially dangerous onesâ€”across parts of Golarion, with some governments issuing bounties to reduce their populations. Others make contact and cut deals with individual drakes to defend property in exchange for treasure. or ally with them to bolster a city's defenses.
> Talented [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] have been known to take [[Shadow drake|shadow drakes]] as [[Familiar|familiars]], though they might also independently align themselves with someone attuned to their mischievous nature. The legendary *[[Orb of Dragonkin|Orbs of Dragonkin]]* include one capable of dominating drakes, and certain [[Magic item|magic items]] can make certain types of drakes easier to [[Magic/Conjuration|summon]]. Beyond these exceptions, however, most attempts to domesticate drakes end in catastrophe.
> Drake eggs are considered valuable commodities, and are used as [[Spell component|spell components]], eaten as food and, most commonly, incubated to hatch drake mounts and guardians. However, this trade is criminalized in many societies, as drakes are both evil and intelligent creatures.


### In the Inner Sea region

> Near the Winged Wood, a growing number of drakes corrupted by [[Demon|demonic]] forces of the [[Worldwound]] became [[Half-fiend|half-fiends]].
> [[Giant|Giants]] across the [[Inner Sea region]] are known to breed and keep [[Frost drake|frost drakes]] and pets, minions, and even mounts for their allies.
> Colonists of [[Xin-Shalast]] from [[Riddleport]] hunt frost drakes for food near the rediscovered city.
> The draconic monument known as the [[Sleeper]], located deep in the [[Mindspin Mountains]], draws drakes who lair in its chambers and the mountain beneath. [[Flame drake|Flame drakes]] favor the crest of [[Droskar's Crag|Droskars Crag]] as a nesting perch.


### In Tian Xia

> [[Goka]] hosts drake races that are popular with nobles and feature lavish purses for the victors.


### Notable drakes

> - Kjef-kadeq, a [[Desert drake|desert drake]] in the [[Parched Dunes]].

## On distant worlds

> Frost drakes are plentiful in the namesake [[Drakelands]] of [[Triaxus]], where they serve in armies under and alongside [[Dragonkin|dragonkin]].


> [[Paizo]] published a major article about drakes, titled "Ecology of the Drake", in *[[The Hill Giant's Pledge|The Hill Giants Pledge]]*.
