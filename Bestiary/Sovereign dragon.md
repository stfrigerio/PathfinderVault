> The most powerful of the [[Imperial dragon|imperial dragons]], **sovereign dragons** were supposedly sent by the [[Deity|gods]] to maintain balance and safeguard harmony on the continent of [[Tian Xia]]. Impressive wingless creatures with [[Gold|golden]] scales, they are also known as **lungwangs** in [[Tien]].



## Appearance

> Virtually all sovereign dragons are vibrant gold, both in their scales and in the [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] they wear even while in [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/dragon|dragon]] form. Sovereign dragons are the only imperial dragons to have five claws on each hand, which some ascribe to their special status and others deride. The hair of sovereign dragons can be any color commonly found among [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/human|humans]], but can also range into vibrant reds, greens, and blues.


## Abilities

> Unlike most of the imperial dragons, sovereign dragons are partially outside of the draconic cycle, having no great weakness to wood or strength from fire despite their affinity for earth. Some other imperial dragons suspect foul play, wondering out loud if the sovereign dragons had to make some [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] bargain to achieve this status. The breath weapon of the sovereign dragon also has no [[Element|elemental]] component, being rather a sharp blast of [[Psychic energy|psychic energy]]. Adult and older sovereign dragons can grant boons to their servants. Ancient sovereign dragons further this focus on mental prowess and skill and are able to shrug off mental effects with little effort.


## Society

> Sovereign dragons are overwhelmingly the most likely to act directly in [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/humanoid|humanoid]] affairs, historically known as kingmakers and advisors to the nations of Tian Xia. Many appreciate the wisdom offered by the powerful creatures, though just as many decry their staunch neutrality in all matters.
> Moving from kingmakers to kings, the nation of [[Xa Hoi]] has been ruled by sovereign dragons for almost seven millennia. The current Dragon King, [[Pham Duc Quan]], successfully guided the nation through the fall of [[Lung Wa]] after chaos descended upon the continent.
