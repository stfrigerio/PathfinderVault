> The **mobat** is a species of intelligent, [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|giant bat]] found on [[Golarion|Golarions]] deepest forests and darkest caves.



## Appearance

> A mobat has brown or black fur, and a mouth full of sharp teeth. A typical specimen has a wingspan of fifteen feet and weighs two hundred and fifty pounds.


## Ecology

> Mobats are omnivorous, but their preferred diet is fresh meat. They have also been known to supplement their diet with [[Sweet mold|sweet mold]], a fungus that is a popular food source in the [[Darklands]].


## Habitat and society

> They are generally found in small colonies of up to eight individuals. Their usual habitats are remote forests, hills, and underground caverns of the world.
> Mobats are far more intelligent than normal bats, being almost as bright as the average [[Orc|orc]]. They can understand [[Undercommon]], the common language of the Darklands, but cannot speak it.


## Abilities

> They are reasonably agile and stealthy fliers for such large creatures, and their sharp teeth can cause grievous wounds. However, possibly their most feared ability is their piercing screech, which can temporarily stun their prey.


## Variants

> The [[Urdefhan|urdefhan]] of [[Orv]] ride [[Undead|undead]], [[Ghoul|ghoulish]] mobats called [[Skaveling|skavelings]].


## On other worlds

> Mobats can be found beyond Golarion on the verdant [[Planet|planet]] of [[Castrovel]] and among the [[Asteroid|asteroid belt]] known as the [[Diaspora]].
