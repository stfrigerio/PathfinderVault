## Ecology

> Giant mantises can be [[Summon|summoned]] by [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]], and some [[Red Mantis assassin|Red Mantis assassins]] prefer them out of devotion to [[Achaekek]], the Mantis God. Indeed, Red Mantis assassins can grow powerful enough to take the form of a giant red mantis. Giant mantises sometimes even serve as [[Animal companion|animal companions]], especially to [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of Achaekek.


## On Golarion

> Giant mantises are hardy enough to live in extreme environs, and range from the jungles near [[Saventh-Yhi]] to the [[Border Wood]] of [[Taldor]], and the area around [[Tumen]] in [[Osirion]]. However, they do not easily handle cold climates, such as [[Irrisen]].
> Their connection to Achaekek makes giant mantises commonly favored creatures by operatives of the [[Red Mantis]]. Their scarlet vigil [[Occultism|occult]] [[Ritual|ritual]] requires a giant mantis' claw.
