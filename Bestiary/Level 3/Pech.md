> **Pechs** are diminutive [[Fey|fey]] originally from the [[Plane of Earth]]. They were used as a [[Slave|slave]] race by the enigmatic [[Vault Keepers]], tasked with constructing and maintaining the enormous [[Orv|Vaults of Orv]].
> After the departure of their masters, the pechs have adapted and created tiny societies hidden away in the Vaults. Some pechs fled upward to [[Nar-Voth]], where they mutated into the first [[Dero|dero]].
