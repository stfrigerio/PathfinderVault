> A **pegasus** is a wild, shy, winged [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]]; most are white in colouring. They have [[Human|human]]-level intelligence. While generally disposed to supporting the causes of [[Good|good]], a pegasus is only friendly with other good creatures after that creature has shown a number of good deeds, provided favors, and treated with the pegasus diplomatically. However, once the pegasus trusts such a creature, they may consent to being a mount. Riders must either ride without a saddle or have one constructed that will not interfere with the pegasus's wings. Pegasi also often serve as mounts for the legendary planar warriors known as the [[Valkyrie|valkyrie]].
