    desc: "  A dryad is mystically bonded to a single great tree and must remain within 300 feet of it. If she moves beyond that range, she becomes [[sickened|sickened 1]] and is unable to recover. She must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude save every hour or increase the [[sickened|sickened]] value by 1 (to a maximum of [[sickened|sickened 4]]). After 24 hours, she becomes [[drained|drained 1]], with this value increasing by 1 every additional 24 hours. A dryad can perform a 24-hour ritual to bond herself to a new tree."

  - name: "Tree Meld"
    desc: "â¬º ([[primal]], [[transmutation]]);  The dryad touches a tree of enough volume to contain her and merges into it for as long as she wishes. She can [[Cast a Spell]] while inside as long as the spell doesn't require a line of effect outside the tree. She can hear, but not see, what's going on outside the tree. She can [[Dismiss]] this effect. Significant physical damage dealt to the tree expels the dryad from the tree and deals 3d6 (3d6) damage to her. Passwall expels the dryad without dealing damage. If a dryad uses this ability on her bonded tree, she instead enters an extradimensional living space within the tree; Tree Meld gains the [[extradimensional]] trait. A dryad can bring up to two other creatures with her when entering her home within her bonded tree. The dryad can still be expelled from this space as above."

> **Dryads** are benign forest [[Fey|fey]].



## Appearance

> A dryad appears as a comely [[Humanoid|humanoid]]. Its skin seems wooden and its hair appears to consist of leaves and flower blossoms.


## Habitat and society

> Each dryad is bound to a single tree, most commonly an oak, and sickens (and eventually dies) if it moves more than 300 yards from it. Some dryads are bound to rare trees, such as a clonal colony of [[Titan aspen|titan aspens]], that are a single tree spanning larger distances than many people expect and which grant the dryad unique methods of traversing distances. The number of dryads encountered depends on the location of their trees, but groves of up to eight are not unknown.
> They view themselves as guardians of their forests, and prefer to live in out of the way places away from humanoids. Their natural empathy with [[Animal|animal]] life means they usually get on well with the animals of the forest. They are also able to freely communicate with [[Plant|plants]].


## Abilities

> Dryads are not strong, but are very nimble and make passable archers. In common with many other fey, they are somewhat resistant to [[Weapon|weapons]] not made of [[Cold iron|cold iron]]. They are also able to meld into trees to escape enemies.
> They also have a number of plant-related spell-like abilities and are able to magically charm visitors. Some may keep charmed bodyguards.


## On Golarion

> Dryads are found in almost all [[Avistan|Avistani]] forests, though they are rarer in northern climates. The largest dryad population is in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].
> The blighted [[Axan Wood]] in [[Geb's Rest]] is home to a unique race of [[Undead|undead]] dryads; its trees are all either dead or undead.
> There was a large population of dryads in [[Sarkoris]] before the opening of the [[Worldwound]]. Very few dryads remain after repeated massacres by [[Demon|demonic]] invaders. Dryads in neighboring nations hold yearly remembrances for their fallen fellows each spring. 


## Hamadryad or dryad queen


> A **hamadryad** or **dryad queen** is a more powerful dryad ruling over a forest, rather than a single tree, and caring for all the dryads in her realm.
