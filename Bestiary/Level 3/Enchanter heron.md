> **Enchanter herons** are a species of large grey-and-white [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]] with long beaks found only in [[Azlant]]. Due to their long exposure to [[Magic|magical]] energies, their pale sapphire throat sacs are bioluminescent. An enchanter heron stands about eight feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.
