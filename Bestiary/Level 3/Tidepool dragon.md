> **Tidepool dragons** are diminutive [[Dragon|dragons]] native to warm, shallow seas.



## Appearance

> Tidepool dragons are roughly the same size as [[Faerie dragon|faerie dragons]] and [[Pseudodragon|pseudodragons]], typically growing to two feet in length. A tidepool dragon's body is covered in a combination of scales and chitinous shell, both blue in color. Tidepool dragons possess a pair of finlike wings attached to their backs, as well as two legs ending in crab-like pincers. Behind their torsos, their bodies end in long, muscular tails.


## Ecology

> Tidepool dragons are carnivores and feed primarily on on [[Fish|fish]], although they also prey on crustaceans, shellfish, and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|seabirds]]. They possess two bones at the backs of their throats that can be rapidly vibrated, generating intense heat. By forcing water over these bones as they vibrate, a tidepool dragon can produce a jet of scalding water hot enough to melt glass. This jet quickly diffuses when released underwater, and serves as the dragons' primary way of killing schools of fish when hunting.
> Tidepool dragons are amphibious, and can breathe air indefinitely. Their wings, in addition to being used for propulsion underwater, are capable of sustaining flight, allowing a tidepool dragon to pursue seabirds in the air.
> Tidepool dragons prefer to live in coastal waters, especially the tide pools that give them their name.
> Tidepool dragon eggs and hatchlings are often preyed upon by [[Bunyip|bunyips]].
> Unless they succumb to accident or other causes, tidepool dragons can live for up to 300 years.


## Society and culture

> Typically, tidepool dragons live in mated pairs or family groups in coastal caves. Parents raise their young until these can survive on their own, typically at three years of age, at which point the young dragons set off to find their own lairs and mates and to explore the wider world. Young tidepool dragons often band together in pods of unrelated individuals while adventuring.
> Tidepool dragons tend to have a tempestuous relationship with other species, as they are highly territorial and prone to attacking individuals they feel are trespassing on their territories. They are also prone to playing tricks and mischief on other beings. However, tidepool dragons can be bribed or bargained with fairly easily, as they respond well to offerings of [[Gems|gems]], [[Coins|coins]], colorful shells, and shiny trinkets; they are also partial to exotic foods, especially deepwater fish, and inland fruits that they normally cannot obtain themselves.
> When suitably paid, tidepool dragons can be convinced to act as scouts and lookouts for [[Ship|ships]]. Aquatic races such as [[Merfolk|merfolk]], [[Triton|tritons]], [[Aquatic elf|aquatic elves]], and [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] are also known to ally with bands of tidepool dragons for these reasons. Rarely, a [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]] may be able to take a tidepool dragon on as a [[Familiar|familiar]].
