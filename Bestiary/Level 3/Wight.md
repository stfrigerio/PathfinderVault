> - the person faced a violent end;
> - their dead body was used to create a wight using [[Necromancy|necromantic magic]];
> - the dead [[Soul|soul]] was a particularly nasty person in life;
> - the corpse was discovered by an [[Evil|evil]] spirit that was already undead and that spirit bonded with the corpse.
