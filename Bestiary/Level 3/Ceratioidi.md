> **Ceratioidi** are fish-like aquatic [[Humanoid|humanoids]] that inhabit bizarre, spired cities in the deep trenches of [[Golarion|Golarions]] oceans.
> Each ceratioidi is actually two creaturesâ€”a powerfully-built female, and a tiny parasitic male no bigger than a large [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Rat|rat]]. When joined, the male and female retain their independent consciousness, though the male's biological functions become linked to those of the female. A mated pair of ceratioidi share a powerful [[Telepathic|telepathic]] link, their unique mental structure allowing for them to excel in many fields of study, including combat and [[Wizard|wizardry]].


## Appearance

> A typical female ceratioidi stands at about seven feet tall, and weighs around 300 pounds, with powerful limbs and a massive, toothed maw. In addition, a ceratioidi possesses a bioluminescent lure, known as an *esca*, attached to their forehead by a fleshy appendage. This lure is the focus for their [[Hypnotic|hypnotic]] abilities, and serves them both in the hunt and in combat.


## Society

> Little is known of ceratioidi society, save for the small [[River Kingdoms]] outpost known as [[Outsea]]. Long ago, in a military campaign against the [[Merfolk|merfolk]], a group of ceratioidi mercenaries were trapped in a patch of magically-contained brine deep inland on the [[Sellen River]]. Left with no choice but cooperation or death, the various aquatic races pooled their resources and created the community of Outsea, a town existing both above and below the waterline where terrestrial creatures trade with their aquatic neighbors.
> Ceratioidi are theorized to be descendants, or at least related to, of the godling Danglosa.
