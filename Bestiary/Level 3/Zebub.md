> **Zebubs**, sometimes known as **accuser devils**, are small [[Devil|devils]] that often serve greater devils and summoners as scouts and spies.



## Appearance

> A zebub appears as a gigantic, bloated fly with the upper torso of plump human child. Its face also displays qualities of the vermin, including bug eyes and a long proboscis. It buzzes at it moves, as would a normal fly, and has the shrill voice of a human child. It stands at just over 2 feet tall and weighs around 25 pounds.


## Habitat & ecology

> Created from childlike souls, zebubs are scoured of innocence by [[Hell|Hells]] fires, before being reshaped in the frozen cesspits of [[Cocytus]]. Once formed, zebubs are used by greater devils and mortal spellcasters as messengers and spies, due to their small size, weak powers and ability to record and tell events. It is common practice for conjurers to slay an zebub once its task is complete to ensure that the devil cannot speak of its dealings with others. However, diabolical lords rarely allow the slaying of one of their servants to go unpunished. In courts, a zebub's ability to transfer it's memories can be used as evidence for an event, and they often lurk nearby to record the signature of an infernal contract.
