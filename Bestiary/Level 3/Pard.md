> **Pards** are cheetah-like [[Feline|felines]] with brightly colored blue and purple coats, which can be solid-colored or patterned with stripes or spots. They can partially phase themselves, and can charge through targets while doing this to burn and injure them.



## Ecology

> Pards are social hunters, live in complex social structures, and mate for life. They are more intelligent than most [[Animal|animals]], and possess limited [[Telepathy|telepathy]] that they use to communicate with each other and, to a lesser degree, other species. Although they normally hunt [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]] and small animals, they are known to develop tastes for [[Gnome|gnomes]] and [[Quickling|quicklings]].


## In Golarion

> The [[Tapur Forest]] of [[Qadira]] is known to be home to pards, alongside other feline predators.


## In the Great Beyond

> Pards are among the wildlife native to the [[Enchanted Wood]] of the [[Dreamlands]], and are hunted for meat by the local [[Zoog|zoogs]].
