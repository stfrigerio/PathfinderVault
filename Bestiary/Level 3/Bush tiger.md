> A **bush tiger** is a species of [[Hyena|hyena]] with an oversized head and neck and underdeveloped hindquarters found exclusively in [[Varisia]]'s [[Cinderlands]]. Their unusual physical proportions make their tracks easily identifiable. Scavengers by nature, packs of bush tigers generally wait for the region's larger predators to finish sating themselves on a kill before moving in. Their powerful digestive tracts can even digest bone, giving them an ecological advantage over other creatures.
> Although they have never been domesticated, bush tigers can sometimes be found for sale at [[Kaer Maga]]'s [[Stockyards]].
