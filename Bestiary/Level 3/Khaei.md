> The **khaei** are a race of diminutive, [[Monstrous humanoid|monstrous humanoid]] creatures with long, gangly, and disjointed limbs who dwell in the deep caverns beneath the ancient city of [[Kaer Maga]] in [[Varisia]].



## Appearance

> Khaei are short, stunted, bald creatures with twisted gangly limbs and bodies that trail off into shadows. A typical khaei stands four feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.


## Ecology

> Khaei are created from the unbound [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] of the [[Dimension of Time]] who got shunted off from [[Stethelos]] to the [[Material Plane]]. They keep no memories of their genesis, but vaguely remember and cherish a time or place where their numbers were far bigger, their cavern-forests linked by standing stones. Because of this, some scholars speculate that the khaei might be unstuck in [[Time|time]], perhaps coming from a different time.
> Khaei are capable of forcefully, rapidly, and debilitatively ageing a foe with their touch, although this ability only works once per opponent per khaei, and also harms the khaei themselves.


## Society

> Khaei live in isolated underground villages. Dull and incurious creatures, they rarely try to leave their homes or change their situation. The [[Dark Forest]] deep below [[Kaer Maga]] is home to the only khaei community in the [[Inner Sea region]], where they live in fear of the [[Dark Rider]], and refuse to approach his Black Keep.
