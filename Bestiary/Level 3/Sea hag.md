> A **sea hag** is a type of [[Hag|hag]] who delights in discord, and torments sailors and others who live by the sea.



## Appearance

> In its natural form, a sea hag appears as an emaciated crone draped in seaweed. A typical specimen is between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds.


## Abilities

> Sea hags lack the magical abilities of other hags. However, their appearance is so horrific that the sight of them can weaken any non-hags forced to look upon them.
> They also have the ability to affect others with a [[Curse|cursed]] evil eye. This curse can send victims into a coma, or even kill them.
> If forced into melee combat, sea hags rely on their sharp claws.


## Habitat and society

> Sea hags are usually solitary but sometimes gather together in covens of three hags of any type.


## On Golarion

> [[Three Hags Rock]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of the [[Ironbound Archipelago]] has long been rumoured to harbour sea hags in some of its caves though no one has survived to confirm this.
> [[Peg o' Ness|Peg o Ness]] is an infamous [[Varisia|Varisian]] sea hag.
