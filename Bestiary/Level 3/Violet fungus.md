> A **violet fungus** is one of the most feared fungal inhabitants of the [[Darklands]].  A touch by one of its tendrils causes flesh to rot to the bone at an alarming rate.

## Violet fungi in Golarion

> Although these plants can be found in dark and damp subterranean locations throughout [[Golarion]], they are often planted purposefully near the lairs of [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]] and [[Vegepygmy|vegepygmies]] to keep away predators.  They have been spotted in such diverse underground locations as the sewers of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]], the less-traveled tunnels of [[Sekamina]], the cavern known as the Nursery Trench below the city of [[Kaer Maga]], the Petrified Shrine in [[Katapesh]], and even very occasionally in swamps on the coast of [[Taldor]] (although this instance may technically be a subspecies).
