> **Caligni slayers**, or **dark slayers** to those outside [[Caligni|caligni]] society, are one of the rarer types of their kind. They tend to be lieutenants to the [[Caligni stalker|caligni stalkers]], but typically try to find a way to dispose of their larger cousins as leaders. Similar to [[Dark caller|dark callers]], caligni slayers embrace [[Evil|evil]] impulses and look to murder their enemies.

## Appearance

> Caligni slayers stand close in size to [[Caligni creeper|caligni creepers]] and [[Caligni dancer|caligni dancers]], at four feet tall and weigh roughly 50 pounds. Caligni slayers are typically easily spotted due to their tendency to be afflicted with a hand tremor. Their skin is much paler, an almost pure white, and is dry and hot to the touch.


## Death

> As with all dying caligni, caligni slayers blast energy which, in their case, is a sonic implosion.


## Environment


### Extraplanar

> In [[4712 AR]], [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] found evidence of caligni stalkers and caligni slayers worshipping the evil [[Tian Xia]] [[God|goddess]] [[Lao Shu Po]] in the *[[Hao Jin Tapestry]]*.
