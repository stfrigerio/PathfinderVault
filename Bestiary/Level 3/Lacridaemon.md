> **Lacridaemons** are a weaker race of [[Daemon|daemon]] that embody death by neglect or exposure to the elements.



## Appearance

> A lacridaemon's body is torn, scraped, and battered across every inch of its grey skin, which is further patchmarked with frost and ice. They have misshapen tails, cloven hooves in place of feet, and their faces are perpetually locked in frenzied, feral grins even as their eyes weep [[Poison|poisoned]] tears.


## Ecology

> Lacridaemons form from the [[Soul|souls]] of those slain by environmental conditions. Those who die after becoming stranded far from help in the wilderness or trapped by cave-ins may become lacridaemons, though exiled criminals, reclusive and corrupt nobles, and those killed by environmental extremes are at the greatest risk. Tragically, most children who become daemons become lacridaemons. Such children are rarely [[Evil|evil]], but their deaths by neglect, abuse, or abandonment risk becoming twisted and feral wretches whose souls are consigned to [[Abaddon]] nonetheless.


## Habitat & Society

> Lacridaemons typically dwell alone, though they sometimes gather with others of their kind. Such a group is known as a lurk. They shun the company of all other beings, and even with other lacridaemons, they interact only at the bare minimum.
> Due to their nature, lacridaemons eschew the strongholds and cities of Abaddon to dwell on the fringes of daemonic society. As a result, not only do they rarely rise to positions of prominence, but they commonly come into conflict with the non-daemon denizens of the [[Plane|plane]] that lay claim to areas outside the direct control of the [[Four Horsemen]]. On the [[Material Plane]], they gravitate towards freezing tundras, burning deserts, inhospitable swamps, and other extreme environs where [[Mortal|mortals]] find themselves struggling to survive.


### Combat Tactics

> Lacridaemons prefer to avoid direct conflict and prey on unaware victims, using their weeping and [[Spell|spell]]-like abilities to cause victims to become lost in hazardous wilderness, attacking only when natural hazards have weakened them to near death. When they need to fight, they do so swiftly and viciously, retreating if confronted with superior numbers or force.
