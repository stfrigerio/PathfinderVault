> **Yeth hounds** are emaciated creatures resembling [[Canine|canines]] and originate from the [[Lower plane|lower planes]] of the [[Great Beyond]]. They occasionally serve [[Evil|evil]] people or roam singly, in pairs, or in small packs across the darkest parts of [[Golarion]].

## On Golarion

> Packs of yeth hounds prowl the southern end of the [[Anferita Wood]] in [[Cheliax]].


## As rewards

> Yeth hounds are occasionally granted to servants of [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] entities, particularly beastly [[Demon|demons]], in reward for faithful service. The yeth hounds are seen as signs of great favor, but also keep a close eye on the individual or cult, punishing anyone who displeases their demonic patron. Yeth hounds can also be [[Summoned|summoned]] to serve both [[Divine|divine]] and [[Arcane|arcane]] [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] via the *[[Planar ally|planar ally]]* and *[[Planar binding|planar binding]]* family of [[Spell|spells]], respectively.
