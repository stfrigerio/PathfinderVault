> An **ettercap**, or **web lurker**, is a strange, bipedal creature, approximately the size and weight of an adult male [[Human|human]]. Devious and reclusive, it prefers the company of [[Arachnid|arachnids]], over which it has some control. Although not of great intelligence, some ettercaps worship the insectoid [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Mazmezz]].


## On Golarion

> Ettercaps make their homes overwhelmingly in the dark, forbidding forests of temperate [[Avistan]]. They have been spotted in [[Varisia|Varisias]] [[Mierani Forest]], [[Andoran|Andorans]] [[Arthfell Forest]], [[Taldor|Taldors]] [[Verduran Forest]], living in cairns north of the city of [[Korvosa]], attacking [[Elf|elven]] scouts in the [[Demon|demon-haunted]] southern [[Tanglebriar]] in [[Kyonin]], hiding in caves in the [[Nomen Heights]] and [[Kamelands]] of the [[Stolen Lands]], and overrunning the [[Shudderwood]] in [[Ustalav]]. They are rarely seen in [[Garund]], but have been spotted in the warm, dank forests of [[Sargava]]. Ettercaps have also been encountered in the [[First World]].
