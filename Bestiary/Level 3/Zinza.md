> The **zinza** is a type of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird]] that lives in the jungles around [[Lake Ocota]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. They have teeth like reptiles, hunt in packs, and use their dark feathers as camouflage to blend in with the jungle around them. Zinza birds have been known to prey on lone or injured travelers, but normally stay away from [[Human|humans]] and larger [[Animal|animals]] that they cannot quickly overwhelm with their numbers.
