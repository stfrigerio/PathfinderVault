> **Muldnals** are a race of [[Mole|mole]]-like [[Agathion|agathions]] who guard the underground passages of [[Nirvana]].



## Appearance

> Muldnals stand about three feet tall. Their muscular bodies are covered in dark fur, and they have a pink nose, whiskers, small black eyes, and wide, dirt-encrusted, clawed hands. They usually wear filthy smocks of undyed linen.


## Ecology

> Muldnals are formed from the [[Soul|souls]] of miners and farmers who found peace in their craft, and their skills and talents found their home in Nirvana. They endlessly correct unduly [[Law|lawful]] or [[Chaos|chaotic]] influences, rearrange caverns to be safer or more beautiful, enrich the soil, and decompose fallen leaves in forests to promote Nirvana's health.
> Muldnals are repelled by the smell and sight of blood, and prefer to avoid fighting. They nonetheless can defend themselves with a paralytic bite and attunement to the earth, and a team of muldnals can collapse tunnels or pen in foes to summon more agathions. When a muldnal is killed, it collapses into a pile of dirt and [[Vermin|vermin]].


## Society

> Muldnals appoint themselves as Nirvana's gardeners and caretakers, and make excellent guides if they can be found. They lead solitary lives: when they journey to the [[Material Plane]], they prefer the company of [[Fey|fey]] or [[Kami|kami]] while tending to [[Magic|magical]] sites associated with agriculture and nature. 
> Many muldnals never see another of their kind; when they do, it is a cause for celebration and perhaps an extraordinary [[Engineering|engineering]] project. In some locations where the veil between Nirvana and the Material Plane is thin, muldnals have built numerous legendary caves that [[Mortal|mortals]] seek as places to experience enlightenment, like the [[Cave of a Thousand Stars]] in [[Vudra]] and the [[Emerald Veldt]] in [[Molthune]]. Recently, more muldnals claim to hear the call of Nirvana's earth to an unknown place. It is possible that muldnals might be claiming a home of their own in Nirvana: a massive mountain called the Mouldywarp.
> Muldnals are represented by no [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]], feel beholden to no particular [[Deity|deity]], and assist the followers of [[Erastil]], [[Torag]], [[Benorus]], [[Halcamora]], and so on.
> Experienced muldnals are expected to teach younger muldnals everything they know, and pass their knowledge along verbally as they travel and work together. A lone muldnal also shares their knowledge by making earthen works of wonder.


## Elder muldnals

> Muldnals who live eons in the caverns of Nirvana may grow in both size and prowess. These **elder muldnals** often lead small enclaves of other muldnals and command tremendous respect among them.
