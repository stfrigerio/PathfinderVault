> **Urdefhans** are a warlike race of clear-skinned bloodsuckers who live in the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Orv]], sometimes called **Orvian vampires**. They are the offspring of the [[Daemon|daemons]] of [[Abaddon]], and like their progenitors, seek to extinguish all other life.



## Appearance

> Urdefhans are roughly [[Humanoid|humanoid]] in form, supposedly created in [[Human|humanity]]'s image by the ruler of daemonkind, the [[Oinodaemon]]. In a mockery of surface life, they have translucent skin that exposes their internal organs. While they possess the same basic body structure as a humanoid, their facial features further distinguish them from their less vile counterpartsâ€”wide mouths that stretch almost to their ears, filled with razor-sharp teeth. Urdefhans are also known for their menacing and unique [[Sword|swords]]â€”[[Rhoka sword|rhoka swords]]â€”and [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] that resembles the wrappings of [[Mummy|mummies]].


## History

> The first urdefhans were created by the [[Oinodaemon]], from the hunted [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] of Abaddon, as part of an experiment to seed the [[Material Plane]] with daemon worshippers. Knowing that the urdefhans will be hunted since their creation, the Oinodaemon put them in the vault of [[Minos-Pashat]] in Orv, away from other races, and kept them hidden from the conflicts of the [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]], [[Neothelid|neothelids]], [[Intellect devourer|intellect devourers]], and [[Xiomorn|xiomorns]] around them.
> When the Oinodaemon was defeated and imprisoned by the [[Four Horsemen]], the urdefhans lost the ability to reproduce and left Minos-Pashat out of anger at this imprisonment and respect for their creator. In an act of 'charity', the Horseman of War offered them the ability to reproduce with daemons. The urdefhans later approached the Horseman of Famine for further daemonic mentors, overlords, and mating partners but, in exchange, this Horseman marked them with a hunger for blood.


## Ecology and behavior

> The majority of urdefhan males are sterile. In ancient times, their reproduction was mostly handled by the Oinodaemon, while after his defeat, the Horseman of War allowed them to mate with daemons. The resulting offspring are urdefhans, with a small minority also being [[Half-fiend|half-fiends]]. The most common daemonic parents of urdefhans are [[Erodaemon|erodaemons]] and [[Lacridaemon|lacridaemons]]. [[Ceustodaemon|Ceustodaemons]] are [[Summon|summoned]] to serve as mates only when the offspring's intelligence is unimportant. [[Hydrodaemon|Hydrodaemons]], [[Piscodaemon|piscodaemons]], and [[Thanadaemon|thanadaemons]] are chosen to give birth to aquatic urdefhans, and megalomaniacal ones sometimes sacrifice entire settlements to an [[Olethrodaemon|olethrodaemon]], calming it so it could produce even a single child.
> Urdefhans can drain the blood from living things, weakening their victims and leaving their flesh bloodless and transparent. In some rare cases, victims of an urdefhan's bite who were already destined to be sent to Abaddon can rise hours after death as an urdefhan with only vague memories of their former lives. Some daemonic cults seek out urdefhans to feed on their members, but most such cultists merely die instead of achieving their goal of becoming an urdefhan.


## Society and culture

> They sometimes train and ride [[Undead|undead]], [[Ghoul|ghoulish]] [[Mobat|mobats]] called [[Skaveling|skavelings]].


### Religion

> Urdefhans worship all of the [[Four Horsemen]] as their creators, but are particularly close to [[Szuriel]] and [[Trelmarixian]], who continue to encourage the urdefhan toward continual warfare with [[Weapon|weapons]] and [[Disease|disease]].
> These creatures possess "un-souls" made of [[Negative energy|negative energy]] that constantly drive them toward death. While an urdefhan's "un-soul" allows it to be healed by negative energy in a similar fashion to how [[Mortal|mortal]] creatures are [[Medicine|healed]] by [[Positive energy|positive energy]], it also allows the urdefhan to effectively detonate its volatile [[Soul|soul]], killing it and releasing its energy in a wide-ranging, destructive burst.
> Urdefhans believe that after their death, their souls travel to [[Abaddon]], where they are tortured by their makers.


## On Golarion

> The vault of [[Doga-Delloth]] in [[Orv]] is the heart of urdefhan power on [[Golarion]]. They have also established outposts elsewhere in Orv, including a strong presence in Urkalla, one of the districts of [[Ilvarandin]], the [[Black Desert]], and on islands in the [[Sightless Sea]].
> Urdefhans also trouble the surface folk in villages close to the [[Kodar Mountains]] in northern [[Varisia]].
