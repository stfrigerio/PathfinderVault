> The **merrow** is an aquatic cousin of the [[Ogre|ogre]] (indeed, sometimes called an **aquatic ogre**). They are divided into two distinct species: the smaller **freshwater merrow** and the larger, ocean-dwelling **saltwater merrow**.



## Appearance

> Although related to the land-dwelling ogre, merrows appear substantially different with green, scaly skin; webbed skin between their large claws; and dark green hair. Their size depends on whether they are fresh or saltwater merrows. The smaller freshwater merrows grow up to 12 feet tall, while the saltwater merrows grow much larger, up to twenty feet tall.


## Ecology & Society

> Despite their difference in appearance, culturally ogres and merrows are very similar with merrows being every bit as cruel, sadistic, and bloodthirsty as their land-bound cousins. Merrows are known for attacking fishing villages and towns, raiding in the dead of night to abduct a few villagers and then returning back into the water's depths before a real armed resistance can be organised. Much like ogres, merrows have a strong sense of family and tend to form familial gangs. Unlike ogres, they have a much stronger sense of unity and the infighting and murder that characterises the leadership of an ogre tribe is notably absent from merrow life.


## On Golarion

> Merrows are known to dwell within the caverns that dot the length of the [[Aya-Maru|Aya-Maru Trench]] in the depths of the aquatic nation of [[Xidao]] where they war amongst themselves and with the neighbouring [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]].


### Beyond Golarion

> Merrows are also found on the [[Elemental Plane of Water]].
