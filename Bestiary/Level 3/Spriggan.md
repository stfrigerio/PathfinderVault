> **Spriggans** are small, grey-skinned [[Humanoid|humanoids]] who resemble disheveled, ugly [[Gnome|gnomes]]. They are the descendants of gnomes who left the [[First World]] to come to [[Golarion]], but focused on simply surviving in their new but harsh world rather than embracing community and creativity.



## History

> Known as **Lonely Ones** by other gnomes, spriggans are the descendants of those gnomes who warped their bodies and minds too far in an attempt to resist the [[Bleaching]] when they first came to Golarion. Their natural curiosity has been transformed into a feral cunning and obsession with survival.


## Relations with gnomes

> Occasionally, gnomes will attempt to redeem their dark kin, but there is no evidence that this is ever successful.


## On Golarion

> Rumors persist of an entire spriggan city somewhere in the [[Mwangi Expanse]], presumably the town of [[Elokolobha]] on the southeastern edge of the [[Screaming Jungle]], where spriggans are known as **eloko**. In [[Qadira]], spriggans can be found in the southern reaches of the [[Tapur Forest]] along with a number of other [[Fey|fey]] creatures.
