> **Formian warriors** are the main fighting caste of the [[Formian|formian]] hive.



## Appearance

> Formian warriors stand seven feet tall and weigh 200 pounds. Their carapaces resemble [[Armour|armour]] with striped patterns which vary from individual to individual, although formian warriors in the same hive usually bear similar markings. Their tail ends in a wickedly barbed stinger.
> Formian warriors engrave their exoskeleton with insignia depicting their rank and notable deeds, which are torn out alongside her stinger if the warrior is disgraced.


## Ecology

> Formian warriors grow from grubs hatched in the flesh of carnivores. All are sterile females, but can spontaneously become fertile if their [[Formian queen|queen]] dies. They mature quickly and become too old to fight at the age of 15.


## Society

> Warriors are given more individual initiative than many other formians, and sometimes chafe under hive strictures. All of them answer to the [[Formian myrmarch|myrmarchs]] and through them the queen. Beneath this layer of command, the warriors have their own command structure, based on seniority, prowess and accomplishments. Old warriors often starve themselves or undertake a fatal mission, except the most exceptional ones, who are allowed to live out the rest of their lives as drill instructors.
