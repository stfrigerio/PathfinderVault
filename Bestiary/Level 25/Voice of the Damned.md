> The **Voice of the Damned** is a piece of the [[Angel|angel]] [[Tabris]] corrupted by his creation of the *[[Book of the Damned]]*. The Voice catalogs the ever-growing repository of [[Evil|evil]] thoughts and deeds in the [[Book of the Damned demiplane|demiplane]] within the book, and defends the [[Unspeakable Word]] at the demiplane's center.


## Appearance

> The Voice appears as a stretched, vaguely [[Humanoid|humanoid]] and winged form, wrapped with or comprised of blasphemous pages with a vortex of flame in place of a face.


## Abilities

> As the cataloger and master of the *Book'*s repository of evil, the Voice can read, write, and speak every language, including the ability to scribe magical symbols into any surface, including the air. It can discorporate its form into a cyclone of flying pages, flense foes with its pages, harm creatures with its gaze, and consume a creature into its form. While permanently bound to the demiplane within the *Book*, the Voice can also temporarily inhabit the body of any creature it consumes.
