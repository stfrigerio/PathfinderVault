> **Tarrasque**, also known as the **Armageddon Engine**, is the most powerful of the [[Spawn of Rovagug]]. It is a creature of unthinkable power, bent on total destruction.



## Appearance

> Tarrasque is a colossal, hunched, relatively simplistic-looking land vertebrate, resembling a [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaur]]. Its most notable features are a carapace capable of reflecting [[Magic|magic]] and a huge jaw with sharp teeth capable of swallowing whole villages. Its horns and tail are also deadly [[Weapon|weapons]] in their own right.


## Ecology

> Thought to have been created by [[Rovagug]] while in the [[Pit of Gormuz]], Tarrasque is one of the most powerful and destructive creatures known. It is believed that this creature is the current [[Herald|herald]] of the god of destruction. It is seemingly drawn to [[Human|human]] settlements, brutally exterminating the populace and hunting down escaping survivors. Like the other Spawn of Rovagug, Tarrasque can bring itself back from the dead; one can only hope to banish, trap, or transport it somehow in order to stop its rampage, especially since no method of disabling its regeneration is known.


## History and lore

![[Pit_of_Gormuz.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Tarrasque emerges from the [[Pit of Gormuz]].
> Tarrasque emerged in [[Casmaron]] from the Pit of Gormuz in [[-632 AR]]. It took three months to destroy most of the nearby nation of [[Ninshabur]] and force the elite to hide in magically-shrouded [[Tabsagal]], where they eventually succumbed to famine, [[Disease|disease]], and suicide. After exterminating Ninshabur, it turned west and rampaged into [[Avistan]], destroying the city of [[Oppara]] in the process.
> Tarrasque then sought Rovagug's old foes in [[Garund]] and brought about the fall of the [[Flying city|flying city]] of [[Kho]], capital of the [[Shory Empire]], causing it to crash in the [[Barrier Wall]] mountains in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. It was eventually stopped and imprisoned in a cave somewhere in Avistan; the anniversary of its defeat is celebrated as a national holiday in many nations, including [[Taldor]] and [[Osirion]].
