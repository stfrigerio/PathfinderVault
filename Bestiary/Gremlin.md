> **Gremlins** are a particularly unpleasant type of [[Evil|evil]] [[Fey|fey]] most commonly found living within the depths of the [[Darklands]]. They are loathed by most creatures for their dark and sadistic sense of humour, their malicious and often deadly pranks, and their general mischievousness that always results in either injury or damage to a creature or its property.



## Description

> Gremlins range between one and three feet in height, with the smaller gremlins generally having a stronger connection to the [[First World]] of the fey. Apart from their similar size, the appearance of the different types of gremlin vary hugely from insect-like to [[Canine|canine]], though all are at least vaguely [[Humanoid|humanoid]]. Each type of gremlin has at least one unique ability which they use to wreak havoc on the world, from tinkering with [[Magic item|magic items]], to causing their opponents incredible bouts of bad luck.


### Species of Gremlin

> While there are doubtlessly many, many more types of gremlins, the most commonly known **gremlinkind** are shown in the box below.


## Habitat & Society

> Their preferred habitat is the Darklands, where they can be found inhabiting the smallest tunnels, especially in places where the dimensional walls between our world and the First World grow thin. They also enjoy living close to the surface, so that they can creep into cities and towns at night to wreak their unique brand of sadistic mischief.
> Gremlins tend to worship [[Archdevils|archdevils]] or [[Demon lord|demon lords]], depending on their race.


> There is a major chapter about gremlins in *[[Fey Revisited]]*.
