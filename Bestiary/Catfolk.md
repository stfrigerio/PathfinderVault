*For another meaning of "Catfolk", please see [[Catfolk language]].*
*See also: [[Rakshasa]]*
> **Catfolk**, known in their [[Amurrun language|language]] as **amurruns**, are lithe, [[Cat|feline]] [[Humanoid|humanoids]] most commonly found in [[Garund]]. They are known for their extreme gregariousness, and an overdeveloped curiosity that often brings them trouble.



## Appearance

> All catfolk have long tails and feline ears, but vary greatly in how much they resemble [[Human|humans]] or true cats. This variety can manifest within a single clan or even a single family, and even closely related catfolk can look highly distinct from one another.


## Adventurers

> Catfolk delight in venturing into unexplored areas, whether untrammeled wildernesses or ancient dungeons. They like finding treasures and baubles, but for most catfolk, the experience of the journey itself is the true reward. Catfolkâ€™s inherent curiosity and agility mean they excel as [[Swashbuckler|swashbucklers]], [[Bard's End|bards]], [[Fighter|fighters]], and [[Rogue|rogues]]. Their love of the natural world and drive to puzzle out secrets of all types leads many to become [[Investigator|investigators]], [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]], or [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]].


## History

> According to their own legends, the amurrun originate from great cats made by the world's creator spirits to hunt down threats to the young world. In order to pursue their task more effectively, these cats were given intelligence and forms suited to making and using tools.
> The catfolk built an early nation in southern [[Garund]], which later collapsed due to unknown causes before [[Earthfall]]. Many of the fallen nation's amurruns left Garund for the [[Valashmai Jungle]] afterwards. The catfolk returned to Garund during the [[Age of Darkness]], during which they resettled the ancient nation's territory and established a new kingdom, which they named [[Murraseth]], under the rule of sister-queens. Records of the previous catfolk nation were mostly destroyed, in order to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.
> During the [[Age of Enthronement]], the amurrun allied themselves with the [[Shory Empire]] and the [[Derhii|derhii]] to combat [[Demon|demons]] and the [[Spawn of Rovagug]]. Murraseth underwent a period of instability at this point, during which the sister-queens abdicated in response to popular anger at their detachment from common needs. Multiple experimental governments rose and fell during this time, eventually culminating in the formation of the Council of Elect. Many amurrun left Murraseth at this time, and emigrated to [[Arcadia]] and [[Iobaria]].


## Culture

> Catfolk see themselves as wanderers, explorers, and wardens against [[Evil|evil]] forces, particularly ones from the [[Great Beyond]]. Their curiosity takes them to the ends of [[Golarion]] to seek and enjoy new experiences and cultures, and many worship [[Desna]], [[Deity|goddess]] of travel. They are adept [[Adventurer|adventurers]], often as [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]], [[Rogue|rogues]], [[Wizard|wizards]], or [[Cleric|clerics]]; traveling catfolk are sometimes referred to as **pouncers**. Catfolk who never travel are typically pitied or looked down upon by others. Catfolk often use travel as a means of resolving personal or political conflicts. When a feud occurs or a catfolk does not support their community's leader, they often leave to travel for a few years and give the issue time to blow over.
> Many catfolk speak their own [[Language|language]], also called [[Amurrun language|Amurrun]].


### Youth and education

> Amurruns are typically born and raised within large extended families. Traditionalist amurruns celebrate their children becoming old enough to explore on their own with a simple challenge to find a hidden object. Catfolk treasure these coming-of-age prizes, keeping them for life as good-luck charms. A second milestone occurs when the individual is old enough to travel on their own, away from the community. This is typically marked by the new adult selecting a rock, piece of wood, or other object from the first location they visit unsupervised, which is kept as an additional memento.
> Higher education, such as in combat, [[Magic|magic]], or skilled crafts, is traditionally handled through apprenticeships. Amurruns skilled in a particular talent almost always have one or two active apprentices at any particular time. A consistent lack of pupils, in contrast, is a significant mark against an individual's skill and prestige in their craft.


### Magic

> Amurruns who master magic typically learn it through apprenticeship to another amurrun magic-user, through bargains with nature spirits or similar supernatural beings, or through personal experimentation. Most catfolk magic-users are [[Bard's End|bards]], [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]], or [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]]; [[Wizard|wizards]] are somewhat rarer. Amurrun wizards usually specialize in [[Magic/Divination|divination]] or [[PathfinderWiki/Magic/Abjuration|abjuration]] magic, but often find it practical to have some experience with all fields of magic. Amurrun [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] often adventure in search of new or long-lost magical techniques.


### Religion

> Catfolk are not particularly religious, and view religion as an unnecessarily strict way of codifying morality and [[Philosophy|philosophy]]. They view [[Deity|gods]] as simply powerful [[Spirit|spirits]] who grant access to the afterlife in exchange for supplication, and typically only give gods or other spirits offerings and prayer as pragmatic attempts to gain greater control over their immediate circumstances. Catfolk who feel a need to worship typically turn to [[Bastet]]; in addition to [[Sarenrae]] as a patron of protecting the world; [[Shelyn]] as a patron of personal expression; [[Cayden Cailean]] as a patron of freedom and joy; [[Erastil]] as a patron of family, harvests, and hunts; [[Desna]] as patron of travel and discovery; and [[Calistria]] as a patron of defiance and secrets.


## On Golarion

> The largest population of catfolk is in the city-states of [[Murraseth]], Frowiseth, Eserowaan, and Ulemsaleth in southern [[Garund]], which lie in what is believed to be the original amurrun homeland. The cities' shared territory is rumored to hide a significant threat to the world and is extremely well-defended, and travel within it is restricted and often barred to outsiders and even most catfolk.[[Anuli]], in [[Holomog]], due to its proximity to Murraseth, is known to house significant numbers of catfolk. Catfolk can also be found in [[Osirion]].
> Numerous catfolk left Murraseth during the Age of Enthronement to settle other parts of the world, founding additional settlements outside of the original amurrun homelands. These include [[Sorroclaan]] within the [[Fangard]] forest of [[Iobaria]] and the treetop city of Usclaeth in [[Arcadia]].
> [[Vudra]] is home to large populations of nomadic catfolk who travel through the subcontinent in large caravans. Large communities of amurruns also live in the [[Valashmai Jungle]] of [[Tian Xia]], which claim descent from rebellious [[Slave|slaves]] who overthrew an ancient empire of godlike tyrants. The Valashmai amurruns are among the most common and peaceful inhabitants of the jungle, and are allied with the local [[Anadi|anadi]] and [[Iruxi|iruxi]]. The catfolk of the [[Chenlun Mountains]] are instead enemies of the [[Fire yai|fire yai]] that live there. Valashmai amurruns typically have [[Gold|gold]] or [[Silver|silver]] fur with [[Leopard|leopard]]-like markings.
