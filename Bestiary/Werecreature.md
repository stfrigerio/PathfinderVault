 Werecreatures can be violent.
> A **werecreature** is a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] creature that can change its shape into that of a specific non-herbivorous [[Animal|animal]] and into a hybrid shape between the two. Werecreatures are distinguished taxonomically from other [[CategoryShapechanger subtype creatures|shapechangers]] by the addition of the prefix "were-" to their names. Though they are not necessarily [[Evil|evil]], they are generally hated by [[Human|human]] society, which almost always sees them as violent, bestial, and diseased creatures. Werecreatures are sometimes informally called **lycanthropes** (if their associated animal is a vertebrate) or **entothropes** (if their associated animal is an insect).



## Natural and afflicted werecreatures

> Two types of werecreatures exist: those who are born with the condition, also known as natural werecreatures, and those who acquire it during their lifetime, either through a curse or through a disease called [[Lycanthropy|lycanthropy]]; these are known as afflicted werecreatures.
> Natural werecreatures have lived with their condition their entire life and generally have control over their transformation (except during the full moon). Afflicted werecreatures often change involuntarily, and have little awareness of their animal or hybrid forms, often turning aggressive and homicidal. While in animal form, they also sometimes lose their identity and do not remember what occurred while they were transformed. Most legends of the violent werecreature come from this latter group. There is no known way to remove a true werecreature's condition; afflicted werecreatures can be cured like any other curse. Before an afflicted werecreature transforms for the first time, the curse can also be removed by consuming [[Wolfsbane|wolfsbane]] (for vertebrate werecreatures) or belladonna (for insectoid ones).


## Werecreature features

> All werecreatures have a peculiar connection to the [[Moon Golarion|moon]]. It often triggers transformation in afflicted werecreatures, and gives them all a vulnerability to [[Silver|silver]], a metal long associated with that heavenly body. They all possess three distinct forms: their humanoid form, an animal form, and a hybrid form that includes the physical characteristics of both. Werecreatures are generally resistant to most [[Weapon|weapons]], although [[Magic|magic]] affects them normally. Weapons edged in silver can hurt and kill a werecreature as easily as a normal human, and they do not possess any such resistance in humanoid form. When killed, a werecreature always reverts to its humanoid form.
> Natural werecreatures carry the disease lycanthropy and can infect others through a bite or a scratch, or pass it on to their offspring. Those who possess stingers can also spread the curse through their sting.


## Werecreatures on Golarion

> Many species of werecreature exist across [[Golarion]]. The most numerous and most successful are the [[Werewolf|werewolves]] and the [[Wererat|wererats]]; the other most feared species are [[Wereboar|wereboars]], [[Werebear|werebears]], [[Werebat|werebats]] and [[Weretiger|weretigers]].
> Two areas in the [[Inner Sea region]] are particularly known for their werecreature activity: the nation of [[Ustalav]] and the [[Darkmoon Vale]] in northwestern [[Andoran]]. In both areas, it is mainly werewolves that attack individuals or small groups who make their living in the forest, such as loggers and hunters. The [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of [[Wolf's Ear|Wolfs Ear]] was known as a haven for werecreatures and other hunted creatures, until a [[Magnimar|Magnimarian]] pogrom drove the shapechangers underground.
> Not all werecreatures, however, are hated by the general population. In some societies they are valued for their skill and ferocity. The armies of [[Molthune]] have long had specialized werecreature units. Among the human tribes of [[Iobaria]], werecreatures are known as "kodlak" and are either hated or venerated, depending on the group.


### Wererats

> [[Wererat|Wererats]] are most common in large cities, where they can best blend in with the general human and rat populations. When found in particularly large groups, they even form entire thieves' guilds to coordinate their illegal activities.


### Werewolves

> [[Werewolf|Werewolves]] are among the best-known of the werecreatures. They are the often violent scourge of small communities, waiting along empty roads or on the outskirts of towns to catch and kill their unsuspecting victims.


### Wereboars

> [[Wereboar|Wereboars]] are generally aggressive, and prefer a solitary forest life. This form of lycanthropy is most common among [[Hill giant|hill giants]].


### Werebears

> [[Werebear|Werebears]] are found in colder climates, where they hunt evil creatures.


### Werebats

> [[Werebat|Werebats]] are usually found in or near dense forests or jungles, and prefer to lair in caves and caverns. They often band together in flocks. There are also reports of [[Drow|drow]] [[Werebat|werebats]] in the [[Darklands]].


### Weretigers

> Fierce [[Weretiger|weretigers]] stalk the jungles of [[Vudra]], [[Tian Xia]], [[Osirion]], [[Thuvia]], and the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


### Other werecreatures

> Although they are rare these days, the wereleopards of [[Katapesh]], [[Nex]], and the [[Mwangi Expanse]] are known for their savagery. The [[Sodden Lands]] are said to be the home of werehyenas, werejackals, and [[Werecrocodile|werecrocodiles]]. The aquatic [[Wereshark|weresharks]] are most commonly found in the [[Shackles]]. There are also myths of wereravens, wererays, [[Dwarf|dwarven]] and [[Gnome|gnome]] werebadgers, and [[Elf|elven]] werefoxes, but none of these have ever been substantiated.


### Jackalweres of Katapesh

> The [[Jackalwere|jackalweres]] of Katapesh are often thought to be werecreatures; this is not the case. Jackalweres are simply [[Magical beast|magical beasts]] that can take on humanoid form.


### Skinwalkers

> Sometimes werecreatures breed with humans or other humanoids. After a number of generations, these unions no longer produce full were-creatures, but a race known as [[Skinwalker|skinwalkers]], shapechangers who largely appear human (or another race if from a different parentage), but can also take on certain bestial features of their forebears. Skinwalkers breed true and generally form small communities of their own kin that can be found throughout [[Golarion]].


### Ulfen lycanthropy

> Unlike most other cultures, [[Ulfen]] don't consider the curse of the werecreature to be especially dishonorable, and believe it is a blessing by the [[Spirit|nature spirits]]. During periods of the [[Moon|full moon]], those who suffer from the curse are locked in special longhouses or spirit houses, which are barred with silver and stocked with enough food to satiate the afflicted person's ravenous appetites.


## Origins

> Some believe that the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Jezelda]] was the first to spread the curse of the werecreature among humans, although both she and her followers dispute this.


> [[Paizo]] published a major article on the 'Ecology of the Lycanthrope' in *[[Broken Moon]]*.
