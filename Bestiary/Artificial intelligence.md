> An **artificial intelligence** (also referred to as an **AI**) is a [[Technology|technological]] sentient intelligence. Similar to intelligent magic items, artificial intelligences inhabit and act through physical pieces of technology. As such, their senses and reach are limited by the technology available to them.


## Appearance

> Artificial intelligences have no fixed appearance, but may take a form in electronic displays or holographic projections that reflects their personality or advances their goals.. They can also possess technological devices possessing physical forms, including [[Robot|robots]], [[Camera|cameras]], speakers, and microphones. In their most essential form, however, an artificial intelligence merely exists in a computer's or robot's core processor.
