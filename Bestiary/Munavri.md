> **Munavris** are [[Telepathy|telepathic]] sailors of the [[Sightless Sea]] in [[Orv]], a body of water deep in the [[Darklands]], and inhabit the islands scattered through the sea. They are one of the few primarily [[Good|good]] races inhabiting this vast underground realm of [[Golarion]].
> Munavris are often clad in jade [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]]. They sail on ivory [[Ship|ships]] with purple sails, and use their naval skills to fight [[Urdefhan|urdefhan]] and [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]].


## History

> The munavris, like many other [[Humanoids|humanoids]] of the Darklands, descend from survivors of the destruction of [[Azlant]]. Their ancestors were sailors and mariners who plied the seas around Azlant when [[Earthfall]] struck, and were subsequently abducted and carried by the alghollthus into the depths of Orv by means of the [[Braid]], the great waterspout connecting the [[Arcadian Ocean]] and the Sightless Sea.
> In Orv, the munavris' ancestors first settled on various islands scattered throughout the Sightless Sea, over time growing increasingly pale but avoiding the degeneration that turned other Azlanti survivors into the [[Mongrelmen|mongrelmen]] and [[Morlock|morlocks]], or the dark pacts that created the [[Dark folk|dark folk]]. However, they were soon driven from their initial homes by relentless attacks by the alghollthus and their [[Skum|skum]] armies. The early munavris eventually found shelter on floating jade islands, which repelled the alghollthus through means not known to them and which remain the location of their major settlements into the present day. A combination of exposure to the Darklands' radiations, the alghollthus' attacks, and the mystical influences of the jade islands eventually caused the munavris to develop their current telepathic abilities.


## Religion

> The munavris' ancestors abandoned the worship of the old Azlanti [[Deity|gods]] shortly after their exile to the Darklands, as most had either died or become unresponsive after the cataclysm that destroyed Azlant. Instead, they turned to the worship of the [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lords]], particularly the [[PathfinderWiki/Culture/Races/Azata|azatas]]. The religious hierarchy of Munavri communities is dominated by three figures known as the agathum, the archum and the azatum, among whom the azatum typically holds the greatest influence in the settlement.
