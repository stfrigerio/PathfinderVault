> **Walruses** are large, marine [[Animal|animals]] with fins instead of feet, long downward-pointing tusks, and stiff whiskers bristling from their broad upper lips. They live in large herds, and the numbers in which they gather, combined with their strength and their fearsome tusks, mean that all but the most aggressive predators avoid attacking walruses. Despite this, hunters often pursue walruses for their meat and the valuable ivory of their tusks. Although they primarily inhabit arctic seas and oceans, some populations are also found in freshwater bodies such as [[Glacier Lake]].


## Emperor walruses

> **Emperor walruses** are a rare variant of walrus found only in remote arctic seas. They resemble enormous versions of their smaller cousins, reaching twenty feet in length and sixteen tons in weight, with tusks as tall as a [[Human|human]]. They are often found living among herds of common walruses, which they protect ferociously.
