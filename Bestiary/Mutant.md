> **Mutants**, or **mutant cryptids**, are creatures twisted by long-term exposure to [[Radiation|radiation]] or bizarre [[Magic|magical]] fields. Their mutations can be either advantageous or harmful. Other than radiation, a quirk in their lineage, effects from their environment, or exposure to uncontrolled magic can cause mutation too. Sometimes, a mutant will have evolved its differences.
