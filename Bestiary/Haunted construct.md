## On Golarion

> The necropolis of [[Pan Majang]], located in the [[Clicking Caverns]] within the [[Darklands of Tian Xia]], beneath the border between [[Xa Hoi]] and [[Nagajor]], is home to a forgotten race that haunts the [[Clockwork|clockwork]] constructs they built in life. These haunted clockworks often emerge at night to search for living prey.
