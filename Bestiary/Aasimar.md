> **Aasimars** are the [[Planar scion|planar scion]] descendants of [[Human|humans]] and [[Celestial|celestial]] beings from the [[Great Beyond]]. They are also referred to generally as **angelkin**, **celestials**, or **godtouched**, or by more specific names if their [[Bloodline|bloodline]] is known (*see [[Lineages]] below*).



## Description

> Aasimars often look very human with minor indicators of their unusual ancestry. These differences can span a wide range, but most often are exemplified by an unearthly beauty, hair that shines like metal, strange eye color, or even glowing golden halos. In many cases, an aasimar's beauty is not due to physical traits but rather to a supernatural tendency among others to interpret their features as beautiful or attractive. This heritage can remain hidden for generations and unexpectedly appear in the offspring of two seemingly human parents.
> Aasimars also tend to have strong, confident personalities, with minds that are not easily shaken by doubt or misdirection. They are often quite insightful and perceptive, able to formulate coherent and persuasive arguments with little effort.
> Like their ancestors, many aasimars have an increased power over light and dark, displaying the ability to see in complete darkness for limited distances and spontaneously generate daylight. They also inherit a strong resistance to cold, heat or fire, and corrosive effects.


## Origins

> Most aasimars alive in [[Golarion]] today are not, in fact, direct descendants of celestials, but are generated from holy blessings or the leftover energies of holy places. If they do descend from celestial beings, their ancestry is at least one step removed from the original introduction of that blood: the child of a union of a mortal with a celestial being is a [[Half-celestial|half-celestial]], not an aasimar. Aasimars may be born from the union of the half-celestial with another mortal being. The possibility of an aasimar birth continues to many generations after that union, even when two mortals have children, so long as one of the mortals is a direct descendant of the half-celestial. Although half-celestial creatures come in many shapes and forms, aasimars are only born from [[Humanoid|humanoids]].


### Lineages

> Though for most aasimars the source of their celestial blood is unknown, there are some who can trace their blood back to a specific type of good outsider and their very personalities may be shaped by this ancestry. These aasimar lineages are as follows:















> - [[Agathion-blooded]] (Idyllkin)
> - [[Angel-blooded]] (Angelkin)
> - [[Archon-blooded]] (Lawbringers)


> - [[Azata-blooded]] (Musetouched)
> - [[Garuda-blooded]] (Plumekith)
> - [[Peri-blooded]] (Emberkin)






## Adventurers

> Aasimars are usually prized from birth, and their communities ensure that these blessed children are given much encouragement to follow their divine destiny. Aasimars often devote themselves to a church, becoming [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/champion|champions]] or [[Cleric|clerics]]. Artistic aasimars tend towards a career as a [[Bard's End|bard]].


## Habitat and society

> Aasimars are often treated as living miracles. This tends to result in them being outcasts among their peers during their formative years and being given a significant amount of strange attention from the superstitious who look to receive a blessing from the descendant of an angel. They are not all [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|benevolent]], but certainly tend in that direction.
> Despite their inborn advantages, aasimars can face a number of difficulties in their lives. They often have high expectations placed on them from youth, and envy and resentment from their peers can cause them to face stigmas in their communities. Because of their reputation for being generally good creatures, they are sometimes targeted for killing or capture by evil beings, such as [[Black dragon|black dragons]]. The traits afforded to aasimars by their heritage, such as their beauty, often cause them to be targeted by the [[Slavery|slave trade]].
> Aasimars, due to their rarity, rarely form true societies. It is rare for more than one aasimar to live in the same town or village, or for an aasimar child to find older members of her species to serve as guides or mentors. Aasimars often live among the societies of their parent species as a result.


## Etymology

> The word *aasimar* in the [[Human languages of GolarionCommon Taldane|Common]] language derives from a combination of the [[Languages of the Great BeyondCelestial|Celestial]] terms "aasu", meaning "new", and "imarr", meaning "birth". Interestingly, both words in Celestial are derived from the [[Nonhuman languages of GolarionDraconic|Draconic]] language.

> While they have existed on [[Golarion]] for thousands of years, there has been a recent increase in aasimar births. This is thought to correlate with the increased numbers of [[Tiefling|tieflings]] born in the [[Hell]]-influenced nation of [[Cheliax]] in the last century.
> Aasimars are more common in settlements which have a larger proportion of natives of the [[Great Beyond]], such as the city of [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]] in [[Garund]], and (in the [[Inner Sea region]]) are found in their greatest numbers in [[Varisia]], [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], [[Mendev]], [[Nirmathas]] and [[Andoran]]. Aasimars born in Cheliax and [[Nidal]] are often seen as threats by the dark nations' governments, and are often forced to live in secret. Chelish aasimars, in particular, are often mistaken for tieflings and subjected to the discrimination that the other planar race faces.
> Aasimars, especially emberkin, are held in high regard in the [[Sarenrae]]-worshipping nation of [[Qadira]]. Plumekith are also common among the nomads of Qadira's [[Zho Mountains]], who according to legend were once watched over by the aasimars' [[Garuda|garuda]] ancestors. Likewise, emberkin are also common in [[Rahadoum]] and [[Thuvia]], due to the high numbers of [[Peri|peris]] found there.
> While aasimars are relatively uncommon in most of [[Golarion]], they are the primary inhabitants of the [[Tian Xia|Tian Xian]] nation of [[Tianjing]]. They are descended from a celestial force that arrived in the region thousands of years in the past to fight a [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] invasion, and which passed the rule of the land to their aasimar descendants on their return to the [[Upper plane|upper planes]].
