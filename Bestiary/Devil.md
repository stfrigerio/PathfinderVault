>  **Devils** are [[outsiders]] native to the [[plane]] of [[Hell]]. They obey a rigid hierarchy, base much of their dealings with others on strict contracts, and are always looking to gain an advantage. It is common for devils to provide [[mortals]] with great power in exchange for an eternity of torment and punishment at that devil's hands in the pits of Hell.



## Habitat and society

>  Devils exist in a rigid hierarchy, united under the iron fist of their creator [[Asmodeus]], the Prince of Darkness. Created from the [[souls]] of the damned, their individuality and identity stripped away through centuries of torment until they are reduced to mindless piles of flesh called [[lemures]], devils rise through the ranks by proving themselves through ages of service and torture. Devils can be transformed into different castes by proving themselves to their infernal masters (an [[Erinys]] can be transformed into an [[Osyluth]], for instance), but the hierarchy is not based solely on form, and a highly skilled lesser devil might command less experienced greater devils.
>  Commonly [[summoned]] by mortal [[spellcasters]], devils willingly serve and bargain with those who conjure them, but always seek to pervert their orders to serve Hell's greater agenda. Even the weakest [[Imp]] [[Familiar]] subtly pushes the bounds of its servitude to corrupt its "master" to the service of the Pit.


### Hierarchy

>  Devils are split into several tiers that define their standing in Hell based on their caste and rank, listed here in rough order of power and influence:

Least devils
[[Nupperibos]], [[lemures]], [[imps]]
Lesser devils
[[Gaavs]], [[zebubs]], [[hesperians]], [[magadazes]], [[ukobachs]], [[barbazus]], [[lesser gidim]], [[magaavs]], [[levalochs]], [[salikotals]], [[ascensoriel]], [[erinyes]], [[sarglagons]], [[chortovs]], [[ghalshoaton]], [[osyluths]], [[phistophiluses]], [[uniilas]], [[hamatulas]], [[ayngavhauls]], [[edavagors]]
Greater devils
[[Ashmedes]], [[gylous]], [[greater gidim]], [[bdellavritras]], [[cornugons]], [[gelugons]], [[deimaviggas]], [[advodazas]], [[puragaus]], [[pit fiends]]
Lords of Hell
[[Malebranche]], [[infernal dukes]], [[Queens of the Night]], [[archdevils]], [[Asmodeus]]

### Archdevils

>  Each of the nine circles of Hell is ruled by a different [[Archdevil]], a unique and nearly [[godlike]] fiend. The most prominently worshiped and widely known archdevil is Asmodeus, who is a true deity. He is the master of the deepest circle of Hell as well as the entire plane. The other eight archdevils bow before him. Cultists of these lesser archdevils are uncommon in the [[Material Plane]] outside of [[Cheliax]], and even there they generally pale in comparison to the church of Asmodeus. Often, a worshiper of an archdevil is a lone cultist who practices his faith in total secrecy and lives a deceptively good life.


## Abilities

>  Devils come in numerous shapes and sizes, often with vastly different abilities between types. However, all devils have some traits in common: [[telepathy]] (except for [[lemures]] and [[imps]]), the ability to see in absolute darkness, immunity to fire and [[poison]], and resistance to acid and cold. Most devils can also summon others of their kind and shrug off attacks not made by [[silver]] or holy [[weapons]].


## On Golarion

>  It is unsurprising that most devils on [[Golarion]] exist in and around the empire of Cheliax. Not only is its government modeled after [[the unshakable laws of Hell]], but the governing [[House Thrune]] actively uses devils in numerous capacities. Cheliax's [[Hellknights]] also train with summoned devils; Hellknight signifers coax the ingenuity of diabolical tactics from infernal tongues, while rank-and-file members spar against themâ€”making nearly any future conflict a far less daunting prospect.
