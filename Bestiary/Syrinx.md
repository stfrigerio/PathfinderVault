*For other meanings of "**Syrinx**", please see [[Syrinx disambiguation]].*
> **Syrinxes** are [[Humanoid|humanoids]] native to the continent of [[Arcadia]] with the heads, wings, and feet of [[Owl|owls]]. They are scholars who highly value [[Art|art]] and [[Philosophy|philosophy]], and seek to distance themselves from their own history of [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarism]]. Their methods, however, are anything but cultured, as they seek to [[Slavery|enslave]] all other races (especially those without wings) to serve their quest for cultural progress.


## Society

> Syrinx society revolves around a hierarchy of their subservient races, with the [[Strix|strix]] immediately beneath them. Syrinx [[Magic|magically]] modified the strix race in the distant past to serve as their soldiers and slave masters, though the strix of the [[Inner Sea region]] have all but forgotten their former overlords.


## Language

> As well as using [[Common]] as a [[Language|language]], syrinxes are able to communicate with any [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird]] or birdlike [[Magical beast|magical beast]] and have their own language, which is also known as [[Nonhuman languages of GolarionSyrinx|Syrinx]].
