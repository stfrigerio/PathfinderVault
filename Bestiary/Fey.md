>  **Fey** are [[soul-bearing]] supernatural creatures originating from soul energy in the [[First World]]. While effectively [[immortal]] in the First World, they still have [[mortal]] souls, if of a different nature than those of the [[Material Plane]]. They cannot die without extremely powerful magic. They simply reform from the matter of the First World after some variable amount of time. From [[dryads]] and [[satyrs]] to [[gremlins]] and [[nuckelavees]], fey are varied beyond imagination..

## Culture

>  Fey creatures can often have customs that are unintentionally murderous to outsiders due to their immortality in the First World. They see death as a nebulous thing that rarely has real consequence.
>  While no one can truly rule the First World, the most powerful fey are known as the [[Eldest]], who command great respect and influence.
>  Many fey in the [[Verduran Forest]] play a game called [[Prismati]]
