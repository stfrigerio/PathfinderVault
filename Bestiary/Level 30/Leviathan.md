> **Leviathan** is the mightiest of the [[Tane]], a group of the [[Eldest|Eldests]] destructive servants.


## Appearance

> Leviathan is a massive sperm whale-like creature measuring nearly 150 feet long. It has a hundred red eyes and rows of sharp teeth, and is capable of 'swimming' in air as if it were water.


## Ecology

> Leviathan spends most of its time sleeping for millennia or singing in the [[First World|First Worlds]] vast oceans. The Eldest's whims, planar upheavals, or foolish aggression can arouse Leviathan as a weapon of mass destruction, at which point it rampages through and destroys whole nations, preserving the thoughts of its victims and composing elegies to them; not even [[Ragadahn]] would dare challenge an awakened Leviathan. It is possible to hide from Leviathan's rampage in Zanziveil, the City of the Spared, a [[Demiplane|demiplane]] accessible only via Leviathan's entrails whose ruler, Zizipal, is suspected to be a manifestation of Leviathan's curiosity and remorse.
> Leviathan has visited countless [[Material Plane]] worlds across history. Tales of its visits endure in the survivors' oral history, and many [[Planet|planets]] share similar mythologies of ancient civilisations falling victim to Leviathan.
> Should Leviathan die, it is instead transported across time and space to a hidden spot in the First World's oceans some time in the future, where its body fully recovers but lies in a death-like coma. Leviathan can be killed forever only if its immobile body is discovered and destroyed, otherwise it awakens a century after being slain.
