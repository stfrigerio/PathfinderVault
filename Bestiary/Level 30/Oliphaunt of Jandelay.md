> The **Oliphaunt of Jandelay** (pronounced ALL-eh-faunt of JAN-deh-lay) is the mythical creator, guardian, and prisoner of [[Jandelay]], an enigmatic [[Demiplane|demiplane]] of [[Law|law]] lodged in the [[Chaos|chaos]] of the [[Maelstrom]].



## Appearance

> The Oliphaunt is an [[Elephant|elephantine]] creature of such tremendous size that it laid waste to large sections of countryside simply by walking through it.


## Ecology

> A being of pure chaos, the Oliphaunt is a physical embodiment of apocalypses, and it is compulsively drawn to the fragments of dead worlds from which Jandelay is made. Attempting to remove it from Jandelay is almost impossible; even when an attempt is successful, the Oliphaunt will constantly try to return to Jandelay, triggering a [[Magic|magical]] punishment on those that [[Summoned|summoned]] it.
> The Oliphaunt shares its home of Jandelay with the [[Watcher|watchers]], whom it never notices. Although not a divine being, it is worshipped by many watchers as part of a dualistic faith that venerates it as the destroyer and the First Watcher as the preserver.


## On Golarion

> The Oliphaunt appeared on [[Golarion]] once, during an [[Azlant|Azlanti]] invasion of [[Thassilon]] in [[-6301 AR]], in the [[Age of Legend]]. After the Azlanti executed the [[Runelords|runelord of envy]] [[Ivamura]], the runelord of greed [[Gimmel]] used rune magic to summon the Oliphaunt. He looked at it in the eye and successfully controlled it to destroy the Azlanti invaders. However, the wards protecting the Oliphaunt continued to draw it back to Jandelay. When Gimmel lost control, the Oliphaunt destroyed several Thassilonian legions, including half of [[Xanderghul]]'s Peacock Legion, before vanishing from Golarion.
> Despite the repercussions, [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] of great influence and arrogance still attempt to repeat Gimmel's feat, notably [[Alaznist]], who would have tried to summon it and unleash it upon [[Karzoug]] if [[Earthfall]] had not cut her plans short. After having woken from her slumber, Alaznist travelled back in time with the *[[Scepter of Ages]]* and arranged for the Oliphaunt's arrival in the future to threaten modern [[Varisia]].
