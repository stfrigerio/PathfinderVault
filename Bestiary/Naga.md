> **Nagas**, or "wormfolk" as they are derogatorily known, are a family of strange creatures found throughout [[Golarion]].  They share the same general physical shape: a long, serpentine body with a humanoid head.  All are at least of average human intelligence.  Known naga-kin include the [[Water naga|water naga]] who predominately dwell in warm ocean waters, the subterranean [[Dark naga|dark naga]], the benevolent [[Guardian naga|guardian naga]], the spiritual [[Lunar naga|lunar naga]], the sorcerous [[Spirit naga|spirit naga]], and the five-headed [[Royal naga|royal naga]].


## History

> According to myth, nagas are the children of [[Ravithra]], the [[Vudra|Vudran]] [[Deity|goddess]] of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]]. A canny matriarch, she once tried to grant her children [[Immortality|immortality]] but was stopped by the god [[Gruhastha]] and the first [[Garuda|garuda]] Sudachala, causing the nagas to spread in different directions and diverge into different subspecies. This also began the enmity between nagas and garudas.
> Nevertheless, the nagas did become the first rulers of Vudra in the [[Age of Serpents]], with the [[Vishkanya|vishkanyas]], [[Grippli|grippli]], [[Catfolk|catfolk]], and [[Human|humans]] as their servants. The humans built great palaces and temples where the nagas could live and be worshipped, and the nagas in turn created classes of human professionals that would become the foundation of the future Vudran caste system.
> Eventually, the naga empire suddenly fell. The exact reason has been lost to time: some myths blame Gruhastha and Sudachala again, others blame [[Desna]] for having put them into sleep for 444 years while their empire crumbled, while some archaeologists of the [[Pathfinder Society]] claim that the cause was just a mundane human rebellion.
> After the loss of Vudra, the remaining nagas became paranoid, retreated from the new human civilisation to live in ruins, and stopped cooperating with other naga subspecies. The exception lies in [[Nagajor]], a nation in southwestern [[Tian Xia]], founded by the naga [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]] [[Nalinivati]] and considered to be the sole remnant of the ancient naga empire. They have also spread across [[Golarion]] but remain most common in Nagajor, and some even view Nagajor as their ancestral homeland as if to attempt to ignore the shameful loss of Vudra. Despite the general loss of Vudra, there are still some [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapadas]] within the Impossible Kingdoms, particularly within the [[Crying Jungle]] region, that are openly ruled by nagas.
