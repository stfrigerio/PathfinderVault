> **Plant** is the name given to a type of creature composed of vegetable matter. Plant creatures are known in many forms, including green plants living above ground, presumably undergoing photosynthesis as part of their [[Anatomy|anatomy]]. However, plant creatures are also found deep underground where the [[Sun|suns]] light never reaches; such creatures owe their heritage more to [[Fungus|fungi]]. 'Plant' can also refer to normal, mundane, non-animated entities, such as humble trees and flowers. The study of plants is called [[Botany|botany]].
