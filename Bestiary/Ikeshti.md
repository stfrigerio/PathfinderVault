> **Ikeshtis** are a species of red-scaled reptilian [[Humanoid|humanoids]] native to the deserts and mountains of [[Akiton]], who possess a distinctive life cycle.


## Appearance

> Ikeshtis are small and reactive to the environment, and their bodies can rapidly physically adapt to their surroundings.


## Society

> Ikeshti females, called *congregants*, are tasked with leading the community, while males, called **brood-minders**, watch over the carnivorous, nearly-mindless hatchlings. Males are taught about childcare from a young age and expected to conform to rigid, selfless behaviours, which can exert significant societal pressure.
> Brood-minders who exhibit dangerous traits like violence often come into conflict with societal norms. Those who rebel against these norms might end up branded unsuitable for child-rearing, or even too dangerous to stay in the settlement. In the dangerous wilderness, their demand for survival can supercharge their adaptability, turning them into **riveners**, violent, instinct-driven brutes who possess hulking frames, hardened scales, elongated fangs and claws, and an endless frustration and rage carried over from their past.
