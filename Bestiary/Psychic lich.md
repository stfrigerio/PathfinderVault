> **Psychic liches** are a variant of [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|liches]] who maintain their existence by creating a physical object, called a [[Memoir|memoir]], which projects their personal accomplishments into the [[Astral Plane]] and tethers this astral echo through the [[Plane|planes]]. Such liches can only be destroyed by using their memoir as a focus to erase their astral legend. Psychic liches resemble normal liches, except for the ghostly, constantly shifting images of their past [[Evil|evil]] deeds, which attend them at all times and turn them even more megalomaniacal than usual. Most psychic liches come from races renowned for [[Psychic magic|psychic magic]].
