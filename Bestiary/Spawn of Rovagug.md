> The terrible monsters known as the **Spawn of Rovagug** are the most feared children of [[Rovagug]], [[Deity|god]] of destruction. These nigh-invincible creatures wreak destruction across [[Golarion]], and only some of the world's most legendary heroesâ€”including the god [[Aroden]], first Maharajah of [[Vudra]] [[Khiben-Sald]], and the Legion of Wandsâ€”have been able to slow or halt their rampages.
> Most rise from the [[Pit of Gormuz]] in [[Casmaron]], where Rovagug was initially captured. The first known emergence of a Spawn from the pit was in [[-3923 AR]].
> On the day of [[Burning Blades]] across lands that worship [[Sarenrae]], temples ring seven bells to commemorate their deity's defeat of Rovagug and its spawn.


## Great Spawn

> Six of the recorded Spawn of Rovagug are collectively known as the **Great Spawn**. These infamous creatures have laid waste to entire nations and cut festering swaths of destruction across continents, the wounds of which remain visible thousands of years later.

## Lesser Spawn and unknown entities

> An unnamed creature terrorized the [[Vudra|Vudran]] realm of [[Ninshabur]] in [[-3923 AR]]. Some believe this was [[Ulunat]], though this has not been confirmed.
> Some massive, rampaging creatures known as **Lesser Spawn** also appear in Golarion's history. While they are not conclusively spawn of Rovagug, their similarities in size and destructive nature lend themselves an association with the six greater spawn.
> These include:

> - Agohbindi, the Splintering Child, who once attacked the city of [[Nantambu]] from beneath the [[Vanji River]].
> - [[Crawling Hunger]], a many-legged purple worm with an endless appetite.
> - [[Gray-Stag-Devourer]] of the [[Crown of the World]] and [[Irrisen]].
> - Slohr, an asymmetrical beast which trampled the [[Arthfell Forest]] in [[3537 AR]].
> - [[Urtleytlar|Urtleytlar the Tempest Queen]], a [[Scylla|scylla]] [[Cleric|cleric]] of Rovagug.
