 A [[Keketar|keketar]] [[Protean|protean]].
*See also: [[Celestial]]Â and [[Bestiary/Fiend]]*
> **Monitor** is an umbrella term collectively referring to [[Outsider|outsiders]] from or strongly associated with [[Plane|planes]] that are [[Neutral|neutral]] in respect to [[Good|good]] and [[Evil|evil]]: [[Axiomite|axiomites]], [[Inevitable|inevitables]], [[Aeon|aeons]], [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]], and [[Protean|proteans]]. Their foremost role is to take care of the [[Great Beyond]]: psychopomps protect the [[River of Souls]], inevitables hunt down those who violate their [[Law|laws]], proteans subvert order, and aeons mind cosmic balance. Monitors are usually unconcerned with matters outside their designated purview. Despite being gathered under the same term, different monitors are rivals and often fight each other, most commonly inevitables and proteans.

## Monitor demigods

> Each caste of monitor has its own [[Demigod|demigods]]: 

> - psychopomps revere the [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp ushers]]
> - proteans respect [[Protean lord|protean lords]]
> - inevitables answer to the [[Primordial inevitable|primordial inevitables]]
> - aeons are created by a singular being called the [[Monad]].
> Monitor demigods find it useful to grant [[Divine magic|divine magic]] to their agents on the [[Material Plane]], especially to further the goals that fall outside the purview of regular monitors. They are practical, seeing little use in prayers or elaborate religious rites. Their followers are usually lone scholars or [[Planar travel|planar travellers]] and rarely congregate in large numbers or form organised religions, and like their patrons, most are practical.


### Planar scion

> Descendants of monitor and [[Mortal|mortal]] pairings are [[Planar scion|planar scions]] called [[Urobian|urobians]].
