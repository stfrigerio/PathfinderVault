> The **kuru** are a race of degenerate humanoids who live in the [[Shackles]] and are known to be [[Cannibalism|cannibals]]. They live in the ruins of [[Ghol-Gan]], the ancient [[Cyclopes|cyclopes]] empire, and some believe they are possessed by the spirits of those who built their (now ruined) homes. Among other places, kuru tribes can be found in the [[Cannibal Isles]], and also in the [[Terwa Uplands]] near the [[Temple of the Ravenous Moon]]â€”although they are careful to avoid the temple itself.


## Language

> The kuru have their own language (generally referred to as [[Kuru language|Kuru]]), although particularly intelligent members sometimes speak [[Abyssal Language]], [[Common]], [[Polyglot]], or [[Undercommon]].


## Recent Kuru Encounter

> The beggar [[Strong-Arm Hix]] claims to be the sole survivor of the crew of the *[[Spindrift Reaver]]*, who were captured by the kuru and taken to a flooded temple. The rest of the crew were eaten alive as a sacrifice to a god the kuru called the [[Blood Queen]], but Hix managed to escape.
