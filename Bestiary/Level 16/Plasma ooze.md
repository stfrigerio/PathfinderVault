> **Plasma oozes** are balls of superheated goo that move about by manipulating [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Magnetic|magnetic]] fields. They consume organic materials, yet strangely have the ability to draw [[Metal|metals]] of all kinds towards themselves.


## Appearance

> A plasma ooze is a rippling sphere of violet energy which lashes out with blue tendrils. It is 20 feet in diameter and weighs 6,000 pounds.


## Ecology

> Plasma oozes originate from the [[Sun|sun]], and have also been found on the [[Plane of Fire]]. They can fly by interacting with [[Gravity|gravity]] and [[Magnetism|magnetism]]. They are mindless and only seek to consume organic materials by engulfing and slowly digesting prey, yet their magnetic aura can only attract metals.
> The rare survivors of plasma ooze attacks describe them as like being torn to pieces. Wounds inflicted by a plasma ooze resemble hideously melted burn scars.
