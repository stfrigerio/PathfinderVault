>  The **grogrisant** is a great [[Lion]]-like beast which has appeared a few times throughout the history of [[Taldor]] to test great [[Taldan]] heroes.



## Appearance

![[Mindscape_Battle.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Quinn]], [[Alain]] and [[Merisiel]] fighting First Emperor Taldaris and the grogrisant in a [[mindscape]].
>  The grogrisant resembles a six-eyed lion which stands 18 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 12,000 pounds. Its golden mane amplifies [[sunlight]] to such great brilliance that it can permanently blind nearby creatures who attempt to look directly at it.


## Ecology

>  Its [[magical]] nature hides what should be massive tracks and masks it from [[Magic/Divination]] attempts, which makes its nature and origins unclearâ€”it might be a solitary, unique [[immortal]] or a race of creatures in hiding, but no known evidence proves any theory.
>  The grogrisant has sired offspring, known as [[grisantian lions]], among the lions of the [[Whistling Plains]].


## On Golarion

>  The grogrisant was first seen in the centuries prior to the foundation of Taldor. It wreaked havoc on the city-states in the region, eating livestock and plundering wealth until [[First Emperor Taldaris]] killed it. Since then, the grogrisant has reappeared in perilous times to test Taldor's heroes, and always claims the lives of many pretenders before a true hero ultimately defeats it.


### Primogen Crown

>  According to Taldan myth, the *[[Primogen Crown]]* was forged by Taldaris and contains the grogrisant's brilliant mane.


### Grogrisant's Fang

***Main article: [[Grogrisant's Fang]]***
>  [[Grogrisant's Fang]] is the name given to a vast basalt mountain in the [[Sophra Prefecture]] that casts a shadow across the military city of [[Zimar]]. Other than its name, Grogrisant's Fang is not thought to have any other relation to the mythical beast.
