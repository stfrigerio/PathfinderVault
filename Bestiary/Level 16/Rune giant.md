> **Rune giants** are rare [[Giant|giants]] closely linked to [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] rune magic.



## History

> Rune giants were created by the [[Runelords|runelords]] of ancient Thassilon from [[Fire giant|fire giants]]. They were bred to command Thassilon's armies of giants and were therefore given the [[Magic|magical]] ability to control other giant species. This physiological alteration was sufficient to make them their own true-breeding race of giant.


## Appearance

> Rune giants are towering creatures, with nearly black skin etched with glowing [[Rune|runes]]. They stand approximately 40 feet tall and can weigh up to 25,000 pounds. Their skin is warm to the touch, and a strange grinding and rumbling sound emits from them when they move. In combat, they wear elaborate [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] and helms designed to reveal their rune-scribed flesh, and they wield enormous [[Greatsword|greatswords]].
> The runes inscribed on their flesh are natural. They are faintly visible on the skin of newborn rune giants and, as the child reaches maturity, take on a fiery glow. The type of runes appear to be genetic, as those of a single family name bear similar runes. Crossbreeding with other families results in variation of the runes. Some claim that if one could gather all the different rune giants together the ancient power of Thassilon would be at their command.


## Habitat & ecology

> Like most giants, rune giants have very long life-spans, on average up to 1,200 years.


## On Golarion

> Rune giants are extraordinarily rare and are considered mythical, even by other giants. They can only be found in Thassilonian ruins lost to time, especially concentrated in the city of [[Xin-Shalast]] in [[Varisia]] and in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]].


## Legacy

> When working on the rune giants, the runelords discovered something enormously intriguing about them: hidden within the giants was a shared [[Immortal|immortal]] essence, a core attribute that carried from generation to generation of giant. Each giant carried within it a timeless copy of primeval history. The runelords coveted this aspect, and exhausted great energies to harvest it. This work resulted in the creation of the [[Runewell|Runewells]], and the rune giants themselves became living avatars of the runelord's immortal ambition. The rune giants are somehow the living keys to unlocking and awakening the legendary seven immortal runelords.
