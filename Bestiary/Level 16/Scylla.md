> **Scyllas** are rare, nightmarish, half-mad [[Sorted Traits/creature/aberration|aberrations]] that prey on [[Ship|ships]] and their crew. Due to their rarity, many consider them nothing more than tall tales told by drunken sailors.



## Appearance

> A scylla has the upper body of a beautiful woman, and a lower body of [[Wolf|wolf]] heads and tentacles.


## History

> There are many conflicting accounts of the scylla's origin: the result of [[Demon|demonic]] flesh-crafting and [[Arcane|arcane]] experiments, a [[Curse|curse]] handed down by a vengeful [[Deity|deity]], or the monstrous spawn of a [[Mortal|mortal]] and a [[Deity|god]].


## Ecology

> Scyllas dwell along major shipping lanes, often near coastlines, and lure entire ships to their doom. Though intelligent, they are consumed by hunger and self-loathing. They rarely use [[Weapon|weapons]], preferring to wield [[Magic item|magic items]] on their two human-like hands.
