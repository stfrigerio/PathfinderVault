> **Astradaemons** (pronounced AH-strah-day-mons), commonly known as **void daemons**, are [[Daemon|daemons]] that swim through the [[River of Souls]] like aberrant [[Shark|sharks]], snatching up unlucky [[Soul|souls]] for their [[Evil|evil]] masters. They personify death from [[Negative energy|negative energy]], leeching the very life essence out of their victims.



## Appearance

> Astradaemons are unnaturally thin, translucent [[Humanoid|humanoids]] with spindly clawed limbs, a random number of twitching tentacles extending from their upper backs, and a long tail. They have a skeletal head like a fiendish gulper eel with two pairs of jaws.


## History

> Astradaemons were created in the depths of time by the [[Oinodaemon]]. Suspicious of the [[Deacon|deacons]] created by his servants, the [[Four Horsemen]], the Oinodaemon meshed together hundreds of [[Mortal|mortal]] souls and the essences of lesser daemons to create the first astradaemons. The astradaemons served as the Oinodaemon's own race of deacons, harvesting souls from the [[Astral Plane]] to feed his undying hunger. It was the creation of the astradaemons, a clear sign of distrust from their leader, that planted the seed of resentment in the minds of the Horsemen and led to the Oinodaemon's downfall. The majority of the astradaemons were slaughtered and the survivors enslaved by the Horsemen, who took the secret of their creation for themselves.


## Abilities

> As the perpetually ravenous servitors of [[Abaddon]]'s Four Horsemen, the astradaemons' touch is corruptive and damaging to the spiritual material of souls. Their touch and especially their bite can cause horrific damage, akin to that of a [[Wraith|wraith]], to anything they attack. Most feared, however, is their ability to utterly consume the souls of those killed in their proximity, feeding off of their essence or dragging it back to their fiendish overlords.


## Ecology

![[Astradaemon_portal.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 An astradaemon passes through a [[Portal|portal]].
> Astradaemons hunt the souls of deceased mortals in the [[Astral Plane]] and drag them back to Abaddon before they can be properly judged. They fly through the astral medium in loose packs, dutifully following orders from the archdaemons but caring little for others of their own kind; rival packs of astradaemons have been known to tear each other to pieces. Astradaemons tend to subtly mimic the habits of their patron Horseman's deacons. For this reason, astradaemons are particularly despised by [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]].
> In addition to stealing souls from the Astral, astradaemons also often serve more powerful daemons as assassins and executioners. They may be summoned by mortal [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] for the same purposes, but afterwards, summoned astradaemons seek out their former masters for revenge - either in this life or the next.


## Binding an astradaemon

> Astradaemons are best [[Binding outsiders|bound]] to a [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] will with bribes of souls or the promise of spreading death.
