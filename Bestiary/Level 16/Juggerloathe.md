> The **Juggerloathe** is the devastating offspring of an exceptionally large [[Bulette|bulette]] and the herald of [[Lamashtu]], [[Yethazmari]]. It has lived for centuries in the [[Mindspin Mountains]], occasionally descending into the Hold's plains on voracious hunting trips that have been known to destroy entire tribes. It feeds on the life-force of its prey rather than on their physical flesh, and the victims its devours have been known to be regurgitated later on as [[Bodak|bodaks]].
