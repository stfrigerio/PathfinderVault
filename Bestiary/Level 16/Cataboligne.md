> **Catabolignes** are the living [[Siege engine|siege engines]] of the [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]].



## Appearance

> The cataboligne is a six-legged creature, with spiked clubs at each end of its body in place of heads or tails. A spiky growth sticks up from its back, and a mouth yawns in its belly and drools a terrible flesh-eating [[Poison|poison]]. A cataboligne is 30 feet tall and 40 feet long, and weighs 16 tons.


## Abilities

> A cataboligne can unleash a concentrated beam of entropic power from the spiky tree-like growth on its back, capable of turning all it touches to dust. Creatures that succumb to a cataboligne's horrific appearance feel as though their bodies were falling to pieces.


## Ecology

> Serving as siege engines, catabolignes rampage among [[Demon|demonic]] fortifications, unmaking everything in their path. For some reason, they are not hostile towards [[Protean|proteans]], and the proteans in turn often merrily lead catabolignes on destructive sprees.
