> **Xochatli** is an intelligent [[Clockwork|clockwork]] creature created by the [[Azlant|Azlanti]] [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] [[Auberon]], improved from the design of clockwork nautiloids.


## Appearance

> Xochatli resembles a clockwork [[Kraken|kraken]], covered by rubbery material which was in turn covered by [[Metal|metal]] plates. Its head and tentacles can expand and contract, allowing it to fit into small areas. It lacks [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]] components and cannot be possessed by incorporeal creatures.


## Background

> Xochatli's creator Auberon bound the [[Soul|soul]] of a kraken within it, granting it a malicious intelligence and some limited [[Magic|magic]]. When [[Earthfall]] destroyed Azlant, Xochatli lost contact with Auberon, but continued to follow its master's orders of protecting Azlant from incursions. For millennia, it has patrolled the seas around Azlant until Auberon recently recalled it to his side.
