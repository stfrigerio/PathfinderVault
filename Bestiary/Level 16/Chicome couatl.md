> **Chicome couatls** are powerful but gentle [[Couatl|couatls]] who restore nature in lands that have been cleansed of [[Evil|evil]].



## Appearance

> A chicome couatl resembles a winged [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|serpent]] with verdant green or brown wing feathers, and crimson head and crest feathers. Its wings exude showers of dew and pollen. It is typically 40 feet long with a wingspan of 30 feet, and weighs 5,500 pounds. Chicome couatls can also take the form of [[Animal|animals]], [[Vermin|vermin]], [[Dragon|dragons]], or [[Magical beast|magical beasts]].


## Ecology

> Chicome couatls are solitary creatures and only show up in lands that have recently suffered great devastation and then been cleansed of evil, which they deem worthy of restoration; the exact rubrics for such worthy lands are unknown. Employing [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druidic]] [[Magic|magic]] to purge residual [[Poisons of Golarion|poisons]] and [[Diseases of Golarion|pathogens]] and plant the seeds of new lives, the chicome couatl restores the balance of nature in the land. If necessary, it also coaxes animals from elsewhere to populate the restored environment.


## Society

> Chicome couatls frequently survey their habitat to determine whether they are still needed or not, and search for those that can continue their stewardship: typically an [[Awaken|awakened]] animal, or sometimes a resident of a nearby settlement. Such individuals, known as **Children of the Chicome**, learn [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druidic]] magic from the chicome couatl, and will be reincarnated by the chicome couatl when they die, typically as the animal they most identified with in life.


### Religion

> Chicome couatls usually serve nature-oriented or life-related [[Deity|deities]] like [[Erastil]] or [[Cihua Couatl]], or [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lords]] like [[Valani]] or [[Cernunnos]]; some are dedicated to the [[Green Faith|primordial forces of nature]]. Some even worship non-[[Good|good]] deities like [[Feronia]] or [[Gozreh]], but never those who concern themselves with spreading civilisation or destroying nature, like [[Abadar]].
