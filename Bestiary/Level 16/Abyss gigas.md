## Description

> Abyss gigas are incredibly large, black- or gray-skinned humanoid creatures, well over 50 feet in height and weighing at least 25 tons. They have no obvious organs of sight and their mouths spout large tusks from their lower jaws. They are rarely seen without their heavy [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]] [[Nethys/Equipment/Armors/Full Plate|full plate]], which they wear effortlessly.
