> A **clockwork dragon** is a wonder of [[Azlant|Azlanti]] magic and craftsmanship, originally designed to be used as a weapon against the true masters of that ancient empire: the [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]]. They are some of the most complex [[Clockwork|clockwork]] devices known, and are usually equipped with breath weapons in mimicry of real [[Dragon|dragons]], such as fire, acid, flaming tar, rusting mist, or sleeping gas. Clockwork dragons are often able to partially rewind themselves through the use of their wings, and often have to be reinforced with [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]] if the goal of the creator is of any notable size.
