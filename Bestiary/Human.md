> **Humans** are the most numerous civilized [[Humanoid|humanoid]] [[Races of Golarion|ancestries]] of [[Golarion]] with a variety of ethnicities, and a stake in virtually every corner of the world. Known for their adaptability and versatility, humans have throughout history been behind many of the largest and most prosperous of nations.



## History

> No one truly knows what [[Deity|deity]] or creature first created the human race. According to [[Alghollthu|alghollthu]] wall carvings, they were responsible for humanity's creation, although this claim is impossible to prove conclusively.
> The first great human civilization was that of [[Azlanti Empire|Azlant]], which arose over 10,000 years ago on the destroyed continent [[Azlant|bearing the same name]] in the middle of the [[Arcadian Ocean]]. It was destroyed by [[Earthfall]] in [[-5293 AR]], which ushered in the [[Age of Darkness]]. New great human civilizations did not arise again in the [[Inner Sea region]] until the [[Age of Anguish]], when the [[Jistka Imperium|Jistka]], [[Shory Empire|Shory]], and [[Osirion|Osiriani empires]] flourished in northern [[Garund]].  [[Jatembe|Old Man Jatembe]] and his [[PathfinderWiki/Ten Magic Warriors]] refounded the practice of [[Magic|magic]] among humanity, while in [[Avistan]], the first great civilization was founded when [[Taldaris]] unified the city-states of [[Taldor]].
> The ascendancy of [[Aroden]], the [[Deity|god]] of humanity, ushered in the [[Age of Enthronement]], and the spread of human civilizations throughout Golarion and beyond.


## On Golarion

> Distinct ethnic groups can be found throughout the world, each with its own unique culture and appearance. While mingling does occur, most humans fall into one of these groupings more prominently than the others.
> The known human ethnicities of Golarion are as follows, grouped by continent of origin.
