> **Man-eating animals** are seemingly normal [[Animal|animals]] that have once tasted [[Humanoid|humanoid]] flesh and now seek out such sustenance equipped with above-animal intelligence and carnivorous teeth. This is not a natural transformation but [[Fiendish|fiendish]] corruption of the creature through some [[Abyss|Abyssal]] source.
