> Above even the mighty [[Void yai|void yai]] [[Oni|oni]], there exist the oni [[Demigod|demigods]]â€”entities of nearly incomprehensible power known as the **oni daimyo**. Countless oni stalk the world, slaking their greed and bloodlust to the misery of [[Humanoid|humanoids]]. The great leaders among the oni, beings known as daimyo, are as numerous as the nations of the world, and all oni seek to climb the rungs of power to become such powerful entities.
