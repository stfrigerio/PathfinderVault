> The **[[Rakshasa|rakshasa]] immortals** are the greatest and most powerful of their race. Although they are [[Fiendish|fiends]] with great power and spiritual potency, rakshasas are mortal, and need to reincarnate from life to life to continue their pursuit of debauchery and conquest. Not so the immortals: they have broken the cycle of reincarnation by perfecting their cruelty through countless lifetimes, ascending to true immortality and near-godlike power. These [[Demigod|demigods]] are the paragons of the rakshasa race, to which all other rakshasas aspire.
> Of all the different breeds of rakshasa, the [[Tataka|tatakas]] are the most fanatically loyal to the rakshasa immortals.
