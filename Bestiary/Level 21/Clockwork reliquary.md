> The **clockwork reliquary** is a [[Construct|construct]] created by [[Xin]], founder of [[Thassilon]]. Meant to house his body and spirit, Xin did not get a chance to activate it before his betrayal at the hands of his [[Runelords]]. It is constructed from the exceedingly rare [[Skymetal|skymetals]].
