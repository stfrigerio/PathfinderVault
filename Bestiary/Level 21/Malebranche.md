> **Malebranche** are the least of the divinities of [[Hell]]. A malebranche is chosen every 5,000 years from the [[Cornugon|cornugon]] [[Devil|devils]]: the candidate will then undergo a painful transformation into a unique malebranche. These fiends are only ever transformed for a single reason: to lead the infernal legions in conquest of an entire [[Material Plane]] [[Planet|world]]. Although malebranche are chosen to lead Hell's invasions, they do not always choose to achieve their victories through naked military might. Many of these devils are devious manipulators, who seek to corrupt a realm's defenders before unleashing their forces.
