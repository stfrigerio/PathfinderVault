If he succeeds, the creature is shoved into Krampus's basket and Krampus's spiked chain or claw is freed for future [[Strike|Strikes]]. The captured creature is [[grabbed|grabbed]], [[slowed|slowed 1]], and subjected to Krampus's regression ability (see below) at the start of each round it is captured. If the victim [[Escape|Escapes]] (DC 48), it climbs out of the basket. A captured creature can attack the interior of the basket, but only with unarmed attacks or weapons of light Bulk or less, against an AC of 40. If the captured creature deals 40 slashing or piercing damage, the basket is [[broken|broken]] and all the creatures inside spill out. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or by someone breaking the basket is deposited in a square of their choosing adjacent to Krampus. The basket is an extradimensional space, so the weight of the creatures within doesn't count against Krampus's Bulk limit. Up to four Small creatures or two Medium creatures can fit in the basket at one time. Krampus can [[Repair]] the basket as a 2-action activity that doesn't require tools. If the basket is lost or destroyed, Krampus can create a new one with 1 hour of work. The basket functions as a normal sack if used by anyone other than Krampus."

Krampus can have only one naughty target at a time."

The effect persists for 24 hours, after which the target regains their normal size and their proficiencies return to normal. A creature currently under the effects of regression can't be further affected by this ability.

> **Krampus** is a cruel harbinger of punishment that haunts cold lands during their winter celebrations.



## Appearance

> Krampus is a dark brown [[Goat|goat]]-resembling [[Humanoid|humanoid]] with a pointed nose, swept-back horns, hoofed feet, and a long, greasy tongue that sometimes licks spittle from his fur. He wields a set of [[Iron|iron]] chains and always carries a blood-stained wicker basket over a shoulder. Krampus is a little more than 14 feet tall and weighs nearly 1,000 pounds.


## Ecology

> Krampus needs to eat, drink, and sleep but does not age. If he is killed, another Krampus forms elsewhere after a year, keeps the old Krampus' memories, and likely holds a grudge against his previous incarnation's killer. No one has yet attempted to find a way to kill him permanently, if such a thing is even possible.
> Krampus particularly delights in putting his victims into his basket and transforming them into petulant children before killing them.


## Habitat

> Krampus is said to live in the deep crevasses of ice somewhere within the [[Winterwall Glacier]] in the far north of [[Avistan]].


## History

> The people living in northern [[Irrisen]], where Krampus terrorises, believe that he has always existed and tell many stories of his origin. The most popular of them tells of several mountain towns, whose residents began to doubt the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] who protected them after a series of harsh winters. Under the light of a blue [[Moon Golarion|moon]], the druids took drastic action and opened a [[Portal|portal]] to the [[First World]] to bring forth the most powerful essence they could, a figure to lead people in winter celebrations. However, the druids failed to realise that the villagers' resentment and doubt had corrupted the portal. For a time, Krampus served his intended purpose, before turning into a monster that only sought to punish those who had behaved selfishly, and he sees everyone as selfish.
> The druids, seeing their error, tracked down Krampus and bound him with [[Cold iron|cold iron]] chains when he was sleeping, hoping to force him to return to the First World. However, cold iron is powerless against non-[[Fey|fey]] creatures like Krampus; when he awoke, he claimed the chains as his own and tracked down the druids. Since then, Krampus has had no desire other than to punish the wicked and selfish.
