> **Elysian titans** are the [[Titan|titans]] who sided with the [[Deity|gods]] against their [[Thanatotic titan|thanatotic]] cousins and reside in [[Elysium]].



## Appearance

> Elysian titans resemble titanic [[Humanoid|humanoids]] measuring 70 feet tall and weighing 20 tons.


## History

> In ages past, as a group of titans grew jealous of their deific creators and began a crusade against [[Mortal|mortal]] life. The Elysian titans turned against them, sacrificed some of their power to the gods, and convinced them to imprison the thanatotic titans to the [[Abyss]]. After the war, the Elysian titans retired to Elysium; some of them wandered across the [[Plane|planes]], spawning [[Gigas|gigas]] offspring, who would go on to be the ancestors of [[Giant|giants]].


## Habitat and society

> Elysian titans live in remote, opulent mountaintop homes or in floating palazzi, but often search for new wonders to enjoy in Elysium. They are generally beneficent individuals who collect interesting items and support the [[Art|arts]].
> Lone Elysian titans wander the planes, seeking enlightenment or exploring ancient places of power. Others can be found manipulating events, training aspiring heroes, counselling kings, marshalling armies against tyranny, and inspiring mortals to become legends.
