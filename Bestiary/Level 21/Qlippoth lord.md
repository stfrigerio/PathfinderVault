> **Qlippoth lords** are particularly powerful and unique [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] that wield approximately the same power as the [[Demon lord|nascent demon lords]]. Maybe in the very depths of the Abyss, lie qlippoth that even match the power of demigods. Furthermore, some scholars debate whether [[Rovagug]] is actually the most powerful qlippoth in existence.


## Known qlippoth lords

> The following are some of the qlippoth lords known to scholars:

> - [[Aonaurious]]
> - [[Chavazvug]]
> - [[Isph-Aun-Vuln]]
> - [[Oaur-Ooung]]
> - [[Shiggarreb]]
> - [[Thuskchoon]]
> - [[Yamasoth]]

## Transformation to demon lords

> Eventually, in time after the demons took control of the [[Abyss]], a few powerful qlippoth lords became jealous of the power of [[Demon|demons]] and [[Demon lord|demon lords]] and sought to also transform themselves. By fusing mortal souls to their antediluvian bodies, they became [[Demon lord|demon lords]] and thus gained full [[Demigod|demigod]] status too. They exist to this day, and are generally the least anthropomorphic of their brethren. They include the demon lords [[Cyth-V'sug|Cyth-Vsug]], [[Dagon]], [[Jubilex]], [[Mazmezz]], [[Yhidothrus]] and [[Zevgavizeb]].
