## History

> Kami were created by the gods when the [[Material Plane]] was young and tasked to preserve and protect places and things that could not protect themselves. On [[Golarion]], the first kami appeared in what was to become [[Minkai]] in the [[Age of Creation]]. They are by far most common in that nation, but have spread throughout [[Tian Xia]] in the ages since. Because the kami are limited in number and proliferate slowly, they are rare outside Tian Xia, but hope to expand throughout Golarion in time.


## Kami lords

> Some kami are so powerful they take on the power of a [[Demigod|demigod]]: these are called **kami lords**. One group of kami lords is said to dwell in [[Seseragi Forest]], where Okirori Tomoko is said to have bartered for peace between the kami lords and the Warashi River.


## Veneration

> In Minkai, kami are venerated by the population regardless of a person's class or rank.


> [[Paizo Inc]] published a major article regarding kami called 'Ecology of the Kami' in *[[Forest of Spirits adventure|Forest of Spirits]]*.
