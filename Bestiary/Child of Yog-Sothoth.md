> **Children of Yog-Sothoth** are the less monstrous [[Mortal|mortal]] creatures infused with the essence of [[Yog-Sothoth]].



## Appearance

> A child of Yog-Sothoth can usually pass for a particularly big but typical member of the base creature's species if not for its scaly skin, beast-like legs, tentacles and a tail that ends in a sucker mouth; because of this, most don clothing to hide these monstrous qualities. A child of Yog-Sothoth always exudes an unpleasant scent.


## Ecology

> Traditionally, the creation of a child of Yog-Sothoth involves a blasphemous ritual that uses a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] or [[Animal|animal]], most often a [[Human|human]], as an incubator. The gender of the subject is irrelevant and giving birth to a child of Yog-Sothoth is always fatal. In most cases, the ritual results in the birth of twins: a less monstrous child of Yog-Sothoth and a more monstrous [[Spawn of Yog-Sothoth|spawn of Yog-Sothoth]]. A child of Yog-Sothoth possesses an intrinsic understanding of [[Magic|magic]].


## Society

> The vast majority of children of Yog-Sothoth are created by cults and raised as [[Evil|evil]]; those that are separated from the cults at an early age can be guided towards [[Good|good]]. Children of Yog-Sothoth are loathed by [[Animal|animals]] and [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]].
