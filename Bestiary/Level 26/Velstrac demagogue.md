> The powerful [[Velstrac|velstrac]] rulers called **velstrac demagogues** are [[Demigod|demigods]] possessing strength hardly fathomable by [[Mortal|mortals]]. They exist within a power structure similar to that of [[Archdevil|archdevils]] in [[Hell]], and lesser velstracs view these overseers as horrid sovereigns among their kind. Velstracs who wander through a demagogue's territory know to show respect for these lords of suffering.



## Appearance

> Each demagogue's appearance is a unique perfection of self-disfigurement. Some are strangely beautiful, while others are horrors beyond description.


## Abilities

> A demagogue's powers are vaster than even many of their velstrac kin dare consider. Each controls as much of the realm around their constructed realms as they can, a feat that proves forever challenging in the dark, shifting corners of the Shadow Plane. Though one rarely finds reason to leave the confines of its home plane, a demagogue's influence is far-reaching, and velstracs who value their lives do as they are commanded lest they incite the awful and calculating rage of a mighty overlord.
> Velstrac demagogues rarely oppose each other directly, but prefer to act through proxies, in the process evaluating the performance and ambition of their minions.


## Known velstrac demagogues

> The nine velstrac demagogues live in the Shadow Plane, where they watch over their pulsating kingdoms in massive, gory towers.

> - [[Aroggus]], the Abbey Maker
> - [[Barravoclair]], Lady of the Final Gasp
> - [[Fharaas]], the Seer in Skin
> - [[Inkariax]], the White Death
> - [[Kaikyton]], the Stitchweaver
> - [[Morrobahn]], the Parasite Seed
> - [[Raetorgash]], the Skull-Hoarder
> - [[Sugroz]], the Voice in Screams
> - [[Vevelor]] of the Broken Dream
> At least two demagogues are imprisoned in the Shadow Plane; none of the existing ones admit responsibility for their imprisonment.
