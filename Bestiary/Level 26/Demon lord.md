> A **demon lord** is a very powerful and unique [[Demon|demon]]. They are by definition rulers of at least one layer of the [[Abyss]], and have hordes of nascent demon lords and lesser demons in their service. Being creatures of [[Chaos|chaos]], however, not all demons are servants to a demon lord. As the Abyss is nigh infinite, so too are the number of demon lords.
> All demon lords are technicallyâ€”if not activelyâ€”at war with one another almost all the time. While some alliances are forged and uneasy truces held, most demon lords are actively at war with one or two others. Often these combatants have similar interests (and are therefore rivals for mortal worshipers), or have adjacent layers.
> Demon lords are such powerful [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]] that they are capable of granting [[Spell|spells]] and power to their debauched mortal worshipers, and as such are considered [[Demigod|demigods]]. As demigods, they can take dominion over four [[Domain|domains]].



## Known demon lords

> This is a list of those demon lords with a well-known interest in [[Golarion]]. [[Lamashtu]] is included on this list because she is both a demon lord and a goddess. These demon lords are powerful even among their own kind and are known well beyond the confines of the Abyss.

## Nascent demon lords

> All demons are created from [[Larva|larvae]], the Abyss-damned souls of evil mortals. By amassing tremendous power and prestige, any demon can theoretically transform itself into a unique member of its species. These creatures have not yet achieved the full status of demon lordship, including [[Demigod|demigod]] status, and are as yet somewhat unformed. They must continue serving more powerful demon lords until they come into their own. These creatures are known as **nascent demon lords**, and they exist in their hundreds or thousands in the Abyss. Of this large population, however, very few survive the trials and tribulation of the Abyss and its denizens to ascend to full demon lordship.


### Known nascent demon lords

> Although the true number of nascent demon lords in the Abyss is not known, it is rumored to be in the hundreds, if not thousands. Below is a short list of the most well-known of these powerful creatures, along with the names of the demon lords whom they serve (if any).
> [[Yamasoth]] is a [[Qlippoth lord|qlippoth lord]], so not included in the table below, yet many scholars persist with the notion that Yamasoth is actually a nascent demon lord, maybe the only [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] currently at that rank in the Abyssal hierarchy. This is wrong, and Yamasoth himself is angry at this misrepresentation.
