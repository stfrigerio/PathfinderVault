> **Agmazar the Star Titan** is a [[Kaiju|kaiju]] that plummeted into the [[Valashmai Jungle]] in [[-44 AR]]. It immediately attracted the attention of [[Mogaru|King Mogaru]], who fought and killed this otherworldly foe at a place now known as the [[Star Titan's Grave|Star Titans Grave]].  However, Agmazar's creators built it with a sinister fail-safe, and soon the Star Titan rose as an [[Undead|undead]] version of itself.
> Agmazar was created by the [[Vercite|Vercites]] as a weapon against the undead of [[Eox]]. Agmazar's victories against these invaders were such that its masters decided to launch it directly at their enemy's home [[Planet|world]]. A cabal of Eoxian [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|liches]] averted this attack by conjuring an interplanetary [[Portal|portal]] and redirecting Agmazar to [[Golarion]].
