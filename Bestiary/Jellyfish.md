 Jellyfish swim alongside a [[Merfolk|merfolk]].
> **Jellyfish** are translucent, aquatic creatures consisting of a wide, gelatinous bell trailing several long, [[Poisons of Golarion|poisonous]] tentacles. They are carnivores, although most types of jellyfish are too small to threaten [[Humanoid|humanoids]]. However, they can potentially become very dangerous when they gather in large swarms, something that is known to occur in spring or as a response to conditions such as increasing ocean temperatures. These **jellyfish swarms** do not actively seek out larger creatures as prey, but will strike opportunistically when potential targets enter into the nearly invisible swarm. Despite their name, jellyfish are not true [[Fish|fish]].



## Giant jellyfish




> While most jellyfish only reach small sizes, several varieties are known to reach considerable sizes. **Giant jellyfish**, unlike their smaller relatives, are often active hunters of humanoid-sized prey. Multiple distinct varieties of giant jellyfish are known to exist, often varying in size and possessing different abilities from one another.

> - **Death's head jellyfish** are distinguished by their relatively small size compared to other giant jellyfish species, the skull-like pattern on their bells from which their name is derived, and their ability to produce a toxin that causes the facial muscles of those stung by these creatures to tense in a wide-eyed grimace. They are roughly four feet in diameter.
> - **Crimson jellyfish**
> - **Sapphire jellyfish** store powerful electrical charges transmitted through their tentacles. Their bells are usually 16 feet in diameter, and their sensory tentacles can trail 32 feet behind these creatures.
> - **Vampire jellyfish**
> - **Whaler jellyfish**

## Similar creatures

> Multiple creatures similar to jellyfish exist throughout [[Golarion]] and the [[Great Beyond]]. The components of [[Swimming eye swarm|swimming eye swarms]] are bizarre, deep-ocean entities resembling jellyfish with an eyeball suspended in their mesoglea, which serves both to generate poison and as a sensory organ. [[Whyrlish|Whyrlishes]] are creatures resembling enormous jellyfish native to the [[Astral Plane]], where they feed on the [[Metaphysical|metaphysical]] energies of the [[River of Souls]]. [[Merlucent|Merlucents]] are a species of half-human, half-jellyfish aberrations.


## In Golarion


> Whaler jellyfish are among the predators drawn to the [[Antarkos Ocean]] by the abundant [[Fish|fish]] and krill found there.


## Extraplanar jellyfish

> The [[Plane of Water]] is home to diminutive **bathysphere jellyfish**, which can produce breathable air within their bells and are occasionally used as naturally-occurring breathing devices by air-breathing visitors to the plane. Additionally, a kelp forest within the plane is home to the Lion's Mouth, a sapient jellyfish-like entity composed of billions of perceptive organs.
