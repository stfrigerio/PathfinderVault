> **Formians** are a race of territorial, expansionist, [[Ant|ant]]-like eusocial [[Monstrous humanoid|monstrous humanoids]] native to the Colonies, a continent located in southern [[Castrovel]].



## Appearance

> Formians possess the upper body of an insectile [[Humanoid|humanoid]] and the lower body of a giant ant. More powerful and influential formians are bigger. They speak a [[Languages of the Great Beyond|language]] that consists of scent glands and complex clicks that a humanoid's mouth finds hard to pronounce.


## Ecology

> Formians are divided into five main castes, each specialised on a nominated task. Each hive's [[Formian queen|queen]] is its ruler and sole egg-layer, and serving her are the [[Formian myrmarch|myrmarchs]], [[Formian taskmaster|taskmasters]], [[Formian warrior|warriors]], and [[Formian worker|workers]]. All members of a formian hive coordinate through a shared [[Telepathic|telepathic]] link. In unprecedented circumstances, a formian queen can create [[Mutant|mutant]] castes with abilities adapted to the situation. One such example is the **formian mageslayer**, specialists trained to fight the [[King of Biting Ants]].
> Formians mostly feed on fruits harvested above their hives, and sometimes supplement their diet with the flesh of predators.


## History

> In ancient times, members of formian hives constantly fought against both each other and Castrovel's other native race, the [[Lashunta|lashunta]]. These civil wars ended with the Meeting of Queens, where the leaders of several large hives agreed to work together in service to the concept of an **Overqueen**, the ultimate authority figure of the formian race. The newly unified Colonies then turned their conflicts toward the lashunta, who recognize the formians' Everlasting Queendoms as a perpetual threat.


## Habitat

> Formians build elaborate underground hives that can stretch up to hundreds of square miles. Formians hide the entrances to their hives and keep the ground above largely intact, so from the surface it can be difficult to recognise if one has entered formian territory.
> Formians fiercely defend their territory from intruders and poachers and incessantly seek to expand their presence across the [[Material Plane|universe]]. In order to do this, they hollow out [[Asteroid|asteroids]]; populate each with a single queen, a few myrmarchs and taskmasters, and hundreds of eggs; shield them with [[Magic|magical]] protection; and then launch them toward other [[Planet|planets]]. Not all such attempts succeed, but this has allowed them to spread across the [[Galaxy|galaxy]]. Successful seed ships often establish colonies beneath the surface of these alien worlds, and abandoned formian cities sometimes serve other races, such as the [[Ysoki|ysoki]] of [[Akiton]].


## Society

> The queen of each formian hive is its absolute monarch. All hives are theoretically independent, though allegiances are common and weaker hives often have to defer to stronger ones. Formians that lose their hive for any reason rarely survive long, but those who successfully adapt to the wild or other species tend to become quite powerful.


## On Golarion

> Most people on [[Golarion]] are unaware of either the formians or lashunta of Castrovel. However, formians do live beneath Golarion's surface, particularly around the [[PathfinderWiki/Beehive]] in the [[Barrier Wall]] mountains of western [[Katapesh]] and Stonespur in the [[Hold of Belkzen]].


### In magic items

> The fabled *[[Harrow Deck of Many Things]]* contains a card known as the Queen Mother, which depicts a formian. Drawing this card from the deck causes formians to appear and provide aid, although they are unlikely to share a [[Language|language]] or culture.


## In the Great Beyond

> A colony of three sterile formian queens live in the [[Vault of the Onyx Citadel]], within a region known as Greensend.
> The [[Infernal duke|infernal duke]] [[Furcas]] of [[Forked Pyre]] uses the [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]] claw of an ancient formian titan named Legionnaire as the gate to the [[Hellmouth|hellmouth]] Voulgaz.
