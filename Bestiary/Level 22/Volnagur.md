> **Volnagur**, the **End-Singer**, is one of the [[Spawn of Rovagug]]. It arrived after [[Ulunat]], though the date of its arrival is unknown. Volnagur is among the four spawn best known in [[Avistan]].
> Volnagur had wings and has been spotted throughout [[Garund]], [[Casmaron]], and [[Arcadia]]. There are further reports of Volnagur in the traditions surrounding [[Sarusan]].
> Volnagur's first known appearance was at the site of [[Holy Xatramba]] in [[909 AR]] (not then founded), where it was defeated. If this were its first appearance, it must be the *last* of the Spawn. It was been defeated above the [[Zho Mountains]] in [[1540 AR]], and in the valleys surrounding [[Mount Na-Ken]] in [[2062 AR]].
> In [[4540 AR]], a mining colony in [[Sargava]] consisting of 8,000 people went out of communication. A later expedition discovered that all had perished in a chaotic internal mel√©e. The recent consensus is that it was Volnagur's work. Prior to [[4711 AR]], most assumed that Volnagur was dead.
