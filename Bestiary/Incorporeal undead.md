 A [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Ships/Banshee|banshee]] is an incorporeal undead creature.
> **Incorporeal undead** are one of the four major types of [[Undead|undead]]. This type of undead is the closest linked to the [[Negative Energy Plane]], where the [[Soul|core of their being]] resides. This causes the incorporeal undead to seem intangible when encountered on the [[Material Plane]]. Examples of this type of undead are [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]], [[Spectre|spectres]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Ships/Banshee|banshees]].
