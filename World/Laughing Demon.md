> [[Zokar Elkarid]] runs and owns the **Laughing Demon** tavern in the town of [[Ravengro]], in the [[Canterwall]] county of the nation of [[Ustalav]]. Elkarid faces life with laughter and tries to instil a fun atmosphere in his tavern by creating horror-themed menus and exaggerating what the ingredients of the dishes are. This means that, if a customer finds the humour to his taste, the Laughing Demon is a pleasant and friendly place to meet and drink. The tavern is located right on the east bank of the Ravengro Creek set back from the [[Town Square Ravengro|town square]].
