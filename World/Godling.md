> A **godling** is a [[Mortal|mortal]] granted divine powers through a [[Deity|deitys]] direct intervention, whether by being the deity's direct descendant, powerfully blessed by the deity as a child, or granted mythic power by the deity itself.
> Divine entities who take physical form and visit the [[Material Plane]] sometimes couple with mortals or otherwise immaculately create life within a mortal. The result goes beyond the forms of similar [[Bloodline|bloodlines]] and offspring, such as [[Tiefling|tieflings]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aasimar|aasimars]], to create a child with unique traits and mythic potential.
> One example of a godling is [[Nivi Rhombodazzle]], who became one by trading a gem with [[Torag]].
