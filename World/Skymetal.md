 A meteoroid strikes; many contain precious skymetals.
> [[Metal|Metals]] from distant [[Planet|planets]] and [[Meteoroid|fallen stars]] are known as **skymetals**. These metals are extremely rare and very expensive, such that the impact of a meteoroid can cause [[Gold|gold]] rush-style events. There are seven known skymetals, each with its own particular properties.


## Types

Abysium (also known as feverstone)
[[Abysium]] is a blue-green stone that glows and has a great deal of energy to be found within it. It also [[Disease|sickens]] those who spend time around it. Abysium is rumored to have certain mystical properties, as [[Portal|portals]] to the realm known as the [[Dark Tapestry]] made of the toxic metal have been found in ancient caves below [[Absalom]]. It can also be ground into a powder and distilled to concentrate its [[Poison|poisonous]] effects.
Adamantine (also known as Numerian steel)
[[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine]] is the most common skymetal. It is sometimes known as "[[Numeria|Numerian]] steel" after the land where the largest known deposits are found. It is so tough that it often survives the brutal entry through [[Golarion|Golarions]] atmosphere. [[Weapon|Weapons]] made of adamantine are incredibly hard and durable, able to cut through almost any material with ease. It is also often fashioned into incredibly dense, protective [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]].
Djezet (also known as quickiron)
[[Djezet 1]] is a rust-red metal only found in a liquid state, no matter what the temperature. It is supposed to enhance the power of [[Spell|spells]] and the potency of [[Magic item|magic items]] constructed with it.
Inubrix
[[Inubrix]] is said to be able to pass through [[Iron|iron]] and steel as though it were capable of phasing in and out of reality. Nearly as soft as [[Lead|lead]], it is the softest solid skymetal.
Noqual
[[Noqual]] is one of the rarer types of skymetal and has [[Magic|magic-resistant]] properties. It appears to be a pale green crystal but can be forged like iron. It has half the weight of iron, yet is just as strong. Crafting magic items from noqual requires expensive [[Alchemy|alchemical]] treatments.
Orichalcum (also known as horacalcum)
[[Orichalcum]], sometimes known as horacalcum, the rarest of skymetals, is a coppery, sturdy metal said to bend [[Time|time]] around it. While prohibitively expensive, armor made from orichalcum reputedly slows the wearer's perception of time.
Siccatite
A bright [[Silver|silver]] metal, [[Siccatite|siccatite]] is found to be either very cold or very hot. It is unclear if this represents two different metals or two states of the same metal.

## Alloys

> Whether from alien sources or extremely skilled smiths, skymetal alloys produce specific effects or temper the metals' strange properties to make them more appropriate for use. Notable alloys include:

[[Djezeteel]]
A rarely seen alloy of djezet and steel produces a solid form of red djezet that retains its metamagical properties.
[[Glaucite]]
This gray alloy of iron and adamantine is frequently seen in alien [[Spaceship|spaceship]] hulls and [[Robot|robot]] frames.
