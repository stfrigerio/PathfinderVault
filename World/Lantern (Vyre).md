> **The Lantern** glowers over the city of [[Vyre]], its mauve light lancing out into the [[Arcadian Ocean]]; it is visible to visiting [[Ship|ships]] up to twenty miles out to sea. The Lantern itself is a fortress-like building built upon [[Keelwrack Island]] that serves as the home to Vyre's notoriously corrupt harbour master [[Morgramb Hudd]].
