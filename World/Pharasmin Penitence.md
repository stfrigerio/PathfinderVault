 The [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] of Pharasma.
> **The Pharasmin Penitence** is the [[Philosophy|philosophy]] that one must balance his or her actions through pain and the trials of life to add existential weight to one's [[Soul|soul]] when judged by [[Pharasma]], the Lady of Graves. It is also the name of an [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] order dedicated to this devotion.
> In [[3833 AR]], upon the shores of [[Lake Divirmis]], [[Mother Kavapesta]] began preaching a stoic and sombre vision of devotion to Pharasma that came to be known as the Pharasmin Penitence. Called the Sister of Sorrow, she taught that death's rewards correspond to the suffering in one's life. This does not, however, make the adherents altogether dispassionate. These penitents continue to believe in [[Healing|healing]] the sick, easing excess burdens of people who have already suffered, and a ceremonial form of worship, even as their modest shrines typically dispense with the ornate wealth of the church.
> Regent [[Bavhulameta Ulametria]] leads the sect within Ustalav from her everlasting kneeling position at the altar of Pharasma.
