> The **Moaning Vault** serves as the palace of the loathed [[Drow|drow]] of [[House Parastric]], the only drow noble house not to have its palace within the city of [[Zirnakaynin]]. As worshippers of the foul [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of alchemy, [[Haagenti]], the Moaning Vault is as much a [[Laboratory|laboratory]] as a palace. Here the members of House Parastric research the dark arts of [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]] and [[Fleshcrafting|fleshcrafting]], and is doubtlessly home to abominations more unnatural than [[Drider|driders]].
