> **Herald's Fall** is the echo on the [[Ethereal Plane]] which resonates to the site where [[Tar-Baphon]] killed [[Arazni]] on the [[Material Plane]]. It moves from one location to another, following known [[Ley line|ley lines]].


## On Golarion

> The first sighting of Herald's Fall took place in 3944 AR in Tolbau, a hamlet in [[Ustalav]]. Its terrified residents reported a fog bank rolling into their homes, causing buildings to take the shape of monsters, a sickly black rain to fall, and day to become night. When the fog dispersed, a few residents were gone, instilling panic in those who remained. When priests of [[Pharasma]] from [[Hyannis]] came to investigate, no evidence could be located to back up the claims that anything happened or that the disappearance of people was more than mundane. Eventually, the town moved on, but the missing never returned, leaving behind lingering questions and mental scars.
> In [[4704 AR]], [[Brevoy|Brevic]] [[Spiritualist|spiritualist]] Kalara Atroshka discovered records about the Tolbau event and linked it to several other 'roaming haunt' incidents in northern [[Avistan]]. She believed that they were all the same thing and correctly predicted its next appearance, 125 miles west of [[Chastel]] in Ustalav in [[4714 AR]]. She took a team of scholars to investigate with her.
> When the phenomenon was active, Atroshka used *ethereal jaunt* and witnessed, at the epicentre, a being she believed to be Arazni, surrounded by tormented [[Soul|souls]] and seemingly reliving her torturous death again and again. Arazni's screams and anguish were so great that Atroshka could not remember anything that happened after that. A week after the appearance of the haunt, she was found catatonic and bloody outside of [[Ravengro]], and sent to the [[Havenguard Lunatic Asylum]] in [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]].
> During her recovery, Atroshka named the phenomenon Herald's Fall and concluded that Tar-Baphon intentionally created it. As her entire team was killed and her notes lost, predicting the next encounter with Herald's Fall is impossible. Atroshka suggests that it will manifest again soon, and risks reaching a point of escalation that could endanger most of the [[Inner Sea region]].
