> The **Khopesh Span** is a large stone bridge that crosses the [[Crook River]] in southern [[Osirion]]. It was built during the height of Osirian power in [[-2370 AR]], and besides the [[Shallows of Ipeq|shallows]] at the city of [[Ipeq]], provides the only other place to safely cross the river. It is still operational to this day and is a part of the overland trade route between Osirion and its southern neighbor, [[Katapesh]].
