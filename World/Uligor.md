> **Uligor** is the name of the [[Abyssal realm]] of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Orcus]]. It is an entire world of different environments all filled with [[Undead|undead]].
> The realm is not entirely Orcus', for there exists a vast population of [[Thanatotic titan|thanatotic titans]]: some worship Orcus while others are merely allied to his cause, but others war against him and his allied titans in a civil war which engulfs large tracts of Uligor. The reason for the war and who commands the enemy titans is not known, apart from it being likely to be a shadowy [[Demigod|demigod]]; the war has lasted for millenia.
