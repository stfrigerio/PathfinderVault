> **Viper nettle** is a rare plant that grows along the banks of rivers in the tropical regions of [[Garund]]. Its red berries are known to be an excellent remedy for alcohol withdrawal and are a good all-around [[httpenwikipediaorgantiemetic|antiemetic]] as well. Care must be taken when harvesting the berries, as the plant grows many sharp, red thorns (up to 6 inches in length) that can cause a serious skin rash.
