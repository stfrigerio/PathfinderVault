 Nalinivati's [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]].
> The ***Lotus Annals*** are memoirs written by the [[Royal naga|royal naga]] [[Holadi]], most famous for the many stories and tales it contains about the naga [[Deity|goddess]] [[Nalinivati]] when she was still a [[Mortal|mortal]]. Holadi was Nalinivati's great granddaughter and was quite close to her in life. While the *Lotus Annals* have never been considered one of the holy texts of Nalinivati's faith, they are well regarded by her worshippers as they contain many unique parables and stories about the goddess that come directly from her time as a mortal. Most copies of the *Lotus Annals *are securely kept within the [[Nagajor|Nagajori]] capital of [[Zom Kullan]].
