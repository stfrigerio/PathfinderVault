> **Walleye's Rum Room** is the oldest of the three taverns of the little town of [[Goatshead]] on the [[Firegrass Isle]] in the [[Shackles]]. The town's charter, set by the three [[Pirate|pirates]] who founded the town, is affixed with a [[Dagger|dagger]] on the wall of the tavern. It is written as a childish script of a semi-literate (or a drunkard), "No lawss, nor lords, evry won is hez oon mastr - We ar the lass baschun of freedym.", and is signed by three very shaky X's.
