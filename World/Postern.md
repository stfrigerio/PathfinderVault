> The **Postern Gate**, or simply the **Postern**, is the eastern gate of [[Absalom]]. It is the smallest of the city's gates, only 50 feet high and 40 feet wide, and the only one that is normally kept closed and locked. It is a defensive building designed by [[Aroden]] and made of thick stone with balconies, and is used mainly to get goods to and from the [[Starwatch Keep]].
> The gate was often the focus of siege attacks, and was breached during the [[Siege of Prophets]] even if the enemy forces proved unable to penetrate the city. A carved stone set in the last hall within the Postern commemorates the deepest point the enemy reached. The Postern Gate also serves as the headquarters of [[Eastgate]]'s district guard, the [[Post Guard]].
