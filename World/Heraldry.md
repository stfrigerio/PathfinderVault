Heraldry is employed on Golarion to distinguish amongst other things nations and regions; noble houses and royalty; military and other organizations and chivalric orders.

> In the [[River Kingdoms]], 'nobles' come and go. Some use heraldry to gain an air of superiority or credibility. One such is [[Suvarian|Lord Suvarian]]; his men wear tabards, [[Shield|shields]] or [[Armour|armour]] emblazoned with a [[Silver|silver]] gerfalcon rampant on a blue background.
> In Galt, "the arms of the late Duke of Dabril were properly termed vert, a [[Cockatrice|cockatrice]] in his majesty displayed and inverted tergant regardant or issuant a fountain and transfixed by a [[Unicorn|unicorn]] incensant [[Silver|argent]]. Or, more prosaically: a green field with a crowned golden cockatrice flying out of a pool, only to get stabbed in the back by an angry white unicorn."
