> The **Lands Partition Decree** of [[3247 AR]] was a [[Taldor|Taldan]] law that formalized the political division of the empire, and broke the nation into 62 [[Prefecture|prefectures]] by law. Before then, the lands of Taldor were a chaotic mess after millennia of land trades, inheritances, and bequests that became difficult to oversee and govern. Today, only 12 prefectures and two provinces remain for all practical purposes. The other 50 are politically inconsequential, covering only a few dozen square miles, and created to appease ancient political favor.
