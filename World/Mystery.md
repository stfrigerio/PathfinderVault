 [[Alahazra]], an oracle associated with the flame mystery.
> Each [[Oracle|oracle]] feels a particular connection to a **divine mystery** from which she draws her [[Spell|spells]] and powers. This mystery can be a specific ideal to which the oracle prays, a [[Deity|deity]] or other divine entity, or simply a natural calling or cause. An oracle chooses her mystery (or perhaps it chooses her) at the beginning of her training, or calling, and cannot be changed thereafter.
