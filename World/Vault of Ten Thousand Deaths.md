 The demonic rune of Andirifkhu.
> The **Vault of Ten Thousand Deaths** is the [[Abyssal realm]] of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Andirifkhu]]. It is a vast, [[Trap|trap]]-filled [[Dungeon|dungeon]], as large as a continent, rumored to be connected to many other dungeons in the [[Multiverse|multiverse]]. Some scholars believe that the Vault of Ten Thousand Deaths is in fact responsible for the preponderance of so-called "death-trap dungeons" across the [[Material Plane]]. This rumor of a connection to the Material Plane gives hope to those trapped in this realm that they might escape, and it is often the reason they explore further, falling prey to yet more deadly traps. This however is not its purpose, the Vault of Ten Thousand Deaths, like all Abyssal layers, is a malicious living thing and hungers to expand its fell influence ever deeper into the [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Plane|plane]]. Where the vault touches the Material Plane, new dungeons squirm into existence, serving as deadly lures to foolhardy [[Adventurer|adventurers]] and inspiring new generations of Andirifkhu worshippers.
