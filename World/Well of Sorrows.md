The **Well of Sorrows** is an ornately decorated shaft within the Wizard-King's Pit, a massive dungeon complex built by [[Tar-Baphon]] sometime before [[896 AR]] on the [[Isle of Terror]] in [[Lake Encarthan]]. Originally designed to trap the god [[Aroden]], the Well was never used, and is thought to still be active. Decorated with murals and images of mortality and defeat, it is said to run from the surface all the way to the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Sekamina]].
