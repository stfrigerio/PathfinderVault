> The **Sargavan boar** is a small member of the boar family found in the jungles and veldts of the [[Mwangi Expanse]], [[Screaming Jungle]], and tropical forests south of [[Desperation Bay]]. It is the  size as a small canine, allowing it to more easily hide from its enemies. The boar's main defenses are the loud, earsplitting squeal it emits when threatened, and its small, yet quite sharp tusks.
> These boars are used as meat for both the indigenous tribes of its homeland, as well as the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] settlers of the Mwangi Expanse. The [[Mwangi human ethnicity|Mwangi]] believe the boar to be the guardians of the souls of those who have fallen in the Screaming Jungle. This means that the animal is considered sacred, and only eaten when no other meat is available and only after giving thanks to the animal's spirit. The new colonists do not share this view of the boar's spiritual place in [[Golarion]], causing yet another sore point between the tribes and the colonists.
> Despite the increased amount of mouths eating boar flesh, their numbers have actually increased since the Chelish began to settle, for they quickly adapted to having the colonists' planted crops around, using them as a stable source of food.
