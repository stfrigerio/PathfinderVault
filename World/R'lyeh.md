> The nightmare corpse-city of **R'lyeh** lies deep under an ocean on the planet [[Earth]]. It is the domain of dread [[Cthulhu]], who lies slumbering at the heart of the sunken city, held in stasis by the *[[PathfinderWiki/Items/Artifacts/Minor Artifacts/Elder Sign]]*. At times, R'lyeh rises to the surface and the doors of Cthulhu's tomb open, allowing him to awaken and roam the city for a limited time.
