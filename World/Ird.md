> The fabled lost city of **Ird** is said to lie somewhere within the [[Mwangi Expanse]], but its location is unknown. [[Pathfinder]] [[Innobar DiGomphrey]] is currently engaged in searching for it, but previous explorers have found native guides to be extremely unreliable where Ird is concerned, as the city is taboo.


## History

> Some believe the city was built by the first [[Mwangi human ethnicity|Mwangi]] culture during the [[Age of Darkness]], while others believe the city to have sprung up in one of its successor states later during the [[Age of Anguish]]. Artefacts of Ird have been found in the later [[Rastel]] and Terwa cultures, and also in [[Arzikal]]. They provide a picture of slavery, decadence, and an apparently immortal ruling caste who traded in the souls and lives of their subjects.
> [[Jatembe|Old-Mage Jatembe]] has been linked with the city. In some stories he destroyed Ird, and in others it is his birthplace. Some believe that Ird is also where the Harvestmen were first developed and built.


## Inhabitants

> First-hand accounts of the city don't seem to exist, but it has long been rumored that Ird is home to a variant species of [[Totenmaske|totenmaske]] able to take the form of gold statues studded with gems and jewels.
