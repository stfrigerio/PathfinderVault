> **Grayguard's Shadow** is a small district in the [[Taldor|Taldan]] port city of [[Cassomir]], tightly pressed against the [[Grayguard Castle|Grayguard Castles]] enormous walls. It is built on the same rocky outcropping that supports the castle and therefore doesn't suffer from the [[Blackwood Swamp]] plague like the neighboring [[Admiral's Fen|Admirals Fen]] district to the east. The district supplies the castle with everything it needs. A single fortified dock, which is the only other dock in the city outside the [[Imperial Naval Shipyards]], is surrounded by many warehouses and import/export businesses that supply the castle. In Grayguard's Shadow, the streets, which in Admiral's Fen are sunk into the murky soil, can be clearly seen. The district is well patrolled by the [[Cassomir Constabulary]] and naval security forces.
