 Iomedae's [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]]
> Unlike [[Aroden|Arodens]] realm on [[Axis]], **Iomedae's Realm** is located on [[Proelera]], [[Heaven|Heavens]] second tier. Even though [[Iomedae|she]] is a young [[Deity|deity]], she has been judged of great importance to Heaven, a fact reflected in the expansiveness of her realm. It is a peaceful land of small keeps that somewhat resembles the former realm of Aroden, and is a significant source of support for Heaven's [[Archon|archon]] armies.
