> The **Teikoku family**, or **Teikoku clan**, is one of the five Imperial Families of [[Minkai]], families blessed with the right to rule Minkai by the divine [[Deity|goddess]] [[Shizuru]] herself. The Teikoku founded the [[Teikoku|Teikoku Shogunate]], the first kingdom to unite modern Minkai, and ruled the peninsula until its overthrow in [[3616 AR]]. The Teikoku family were staunch traditionalists and followed isolationist policies while also being the most openly militaristic of the five Imperial Families. The last members of the Teikoku family were slain by the [[Oni|oni]] of the Five Storms as part of their attempt to seize the Jade Throne and gain control of Minkai.
