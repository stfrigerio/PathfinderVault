> A ***mindbind figurine*** is a marble statue that can be linked by a follower of [[Nocticula]] to another creature, transforming the target into a sleeper agent. When a *mindbind figurine* is broken, the victim is [[Magic/Enchantment|dominated]], causing it to play its role in Nocticula's schemes. Known victims of *mindbind figurines* include [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Angothane]], [[Erestos Marburran]], and Miliana Vistrara.
