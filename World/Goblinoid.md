 A [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]], one of several goblinoid races.
> **Goblinoids** are a family of related [[Humanoid|humanoid]] races. Though varied in form, all goblinoids have certain traits in common, notably sharply pointed ears, [[Nonhuman languages of GolarionGoblin|a shared language]], a lifestyle of hunting and raiding, and an aptitude at stealth. Most goblinoids have an evil reputation and enjoy causing pain and suffering, though their methods and motivation for doing so vary between races. It is common to find goblinoids of different species working together, often led by the cunning and ambitious [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]].


## On Golarion

> The barbaric goblinoids have rarely left a lasting impact on [[Golarion|Golarions]] history. In living memory, however, the [[Goblinblood Wars]] swept throughout central [[Avistan]]. Hundreds of [[Goblin|goblin]] and [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]] tribes rose up against the [[Human|humans]] of [[Isger]] and its neighboring countries, leaving death and destruction in their wake. Additionally, within the last hundred years, [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]] seized control of the kingdom of [[Kaoling]] in [[Tian Xia]].
