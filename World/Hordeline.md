> The **Hordeline** is a former, fortified border running between the nation of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] and the [[Orc|orc]] tribes of the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. It was constructed around [[4515 AR]] and consisted of crude, earthen ramparts and palisades.  It ran from the [[Mindspin Mountains]] along the southern edge of the [[Kestrel River]], then headed northeast to end at the [[River Esk]]. It was overrun two years after its construction, in [[4517 AR]], by orc forces who pushed the border further south to its current position.
