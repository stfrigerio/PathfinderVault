 Pjallarene is an Irrisen holiday
> **Pjallarane Day** is an ancient [[Holidays and festivals|holiday]] in [[Irrisen]] celebrated on [[Abadius|1 Abadius]] ([[Holidays and festivalsNew Years Day|New Years Day]]). Every 100 years, [[Baba Yaga]] returns to [[Golarion]] to remove her daughter from the throne of Irrisen, and put another daughter on the throne instead. In [[3713 AR]] the third Queen of Irrisen, [[Pjallarane]], and her children chose to resist. Baba Yaga ruthlessly crushed the rebellion in a single day, which is now celebrated as a holiday. The festival includes feasting and the burning of effigies of tar and straw. This is a reminder of the fate of Pjallarane's followers, who were burned alive as a warning to all those who would oppose Baba Yaga.
