> **Vaingrier Alley**, also called **Oracle's Alley**, runs off of the bustling street market of Barragaro Road and is where some of the more shady, occult vendors make their home. Sham soothsayers read fortunes, [[Sczarni]] thugs work over easy marks, and several of the city's dealers in [[Magic|magic]] goods, both cheap knock-offs and the genuine article, keep shop. One of the most recognised features of Vaingrier Alley is the flower seller Madam Camille and her remarkable, unique hats. The rosy-cheeked matron also possesses an uncanny knowledge of who is selling what and where they can be found; in a place as chaotic as Barragaro Road and Vaingrier Alley, this is almost certainly worth more than the flowers she sells.
