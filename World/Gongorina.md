> **Gongorina** is an immense cavern located 8,000 thousand feet beneath [[Hollow Mountain]].


## Geography

> Gongorina is located in the layer of [[Sekamina]] near the border with [[Orv]], and is connected to the Hollow Mountain above it but not to rest of the [[Darklands]]. The whole cavern glows green, due to the presence of many glowing stalactites. Its southern end is a jagged stony beach, on the shore of a still underground sea. In the southwest, the cavern floor rises, and some [[Metal|metallic]] ores unknown on the surface can be found here. Grey [[Mushroom|mushrooms]] sprout in the northwest corner. In the south, Gongorina is connected to the Snarl, a twisting maze of tunnels, and in the north lie the glowing Glitterstone Spires.


## Inhabitants

> In the [[Age of Legend]], the [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]] [[Laboratory|laboratory]] known as the Castle of Night was built in Gongorina by the [[Qlippoth lord|qlippoth lord]] [[Yamasoth]], who took test subjects from nearby Darklands settlements and the city of [[Xin-Bakrakhan]] at the base of Hollow Mountain. It was the namesake of the [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] species known as [[Gongorinan|gongorinans]]. Yamasoth no longer comes to Gongorina, but many gongorinans, stranded [[Demon|demons]], and experiments continue to reside here. Some of Yamasoth's followers regard Gongorina as an [[Unholy|unholy]] site, but few return from pilgrimages to it; the few survivors occasionally whisper:



“

Gongorina stirs.

”

> It is said that in the [[Dungeon|dungeons]] and passages that continue deeper underground from the Castle of Night lies Yamasoth's only weakness.
