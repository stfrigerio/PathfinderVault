 An akata can naturally produce noqual from its skin.
> **Noqual** is one of the rarer types of [[Skymetal|skymetal]] and has [[Magic|magic]]-resistant properties. It appears as a pale green crystal, but can be forged like [[Iron|iron]], and has half the weight of iron, yet is just as strong.


## Uses of noqual

> Noqual is associated with [[PathfinderWiki/Magic/Abjuration|abjuration magic]], charity, and envy. The mages of [[Numeria]] are believed to have learned how to suppress the skymetal's natural anti-magic properties long enough to create [[Noqual golem|noqual golems]].
> [[Kevoth-Kul]] invented a unique alloy of [[Cold iron|cold iron]] and noqual called sovereign steel, which better allows weapon manufacture by attenuating the pure metal's anti-magic properties.


## Sources of noqual

> Natural, unprocessed noqual can be found almost exclusively in the nation of Numeria, although a recent [[Meteorite|meteorite]] impact near the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Riddleport]] has led to the discovery of the metal there as well.
> The space-travelling [[Akata|akatas]] can create cocoons around themselves by secreting noqual from their skin, however, this biologically sourced noqual is too low in quality to craft noqual items from it.
