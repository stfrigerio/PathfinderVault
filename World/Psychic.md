![[Rivani.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Rivani]], iconic [[Human|human]] psychic.
> **Psychics** draw on their tremendous wells of inner mental power to manipulate the world around them, applying [[Occult magic|occult magic]] as a broad, flexible range of cantrips. Their inherent and unfettered powers often cause others to confuse them for [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]].
> Many psychics are self-taught, but some are tutored by a mentor or classically trained at a facility for psychic development.



## Psychic's Mind


### Subconscious Mind

> A psychicâ€™s power is born deep in their minds. Their subconscious mind might reflect the way their power comes to them naturally, or it could be a framework they use to safely tap into their mind's endless potential. Either way, their subconsciousness decides how the way they access and control their magic.
> Psychics may gain their abilities from throwing themselves headfirst into their raw emotions; specific axioms and lessons taught by tutors and other more experienced psychics; near-perfect alignment and control of their thoughts; or vivid imagination that fuels magic through instincts and associations.


### Conscious Mind

> No matter where in the subconscious mind the power comes from, all psychics find that there's a single specific external manifestation of their psychic magic that comes most easily to them.
> Psychics' powers may manifest as an ability to control physical objects with telekinesis; manipulate energy and temperature to cause explosions and freeze objects; influence thoughts and minds of those around them to heal and manipulate; bring their imagination to life in the form of creations of force and light; or bend and traverse space with teleportation and phasing.


## On Golarion

> Most psychics come from or study in [[Vudra]], particularly at formalized academies and guilds led by prominent rishis similar to the [[Arcane|arcane]] academies common in the [[Inner Sea region]]. As such, monasteries in the Vudrani colony of [[Jalmeray]] host the largest group of psychics in the Inner Sea region.
> However, psychic talents also arise independently in other cultures and regions. [[Erutaki]] psychics are linked via dreams to the [[Nameless Spires]], and members of [[Numeria|Numerias]] [[Technic League]] exposed to [[Radiation|radiation]] or alien chemistry and interbreeding also exhibit psychic powers. Certain techniques are also taught on [[Hermea]].


### On distant worlds

> Out of the [[Planet|planets]] in [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Solar system|solar system]], psychics are most dominant on [[Castrovel]], where cults of [[Lashunta|lashunta]] form a massive gestalt overmind in pursuit of oneness.
> On [[Akiton]], the [[Contemplative of Ashok|Contemplatives of Ashok]], [[Ratfolk|ratfolk]], and [[Shobhad|shobhad]] all count psychics among their numbers. [[Brethedan|Brethedans]] share a psychic gift, and its colony on [[Liavara]] is a single psychic hive mind.
