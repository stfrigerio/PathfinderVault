> **Mage** is a loose term used to indicate a magic user. Unlike the even more generic term "[[Spellcaster|spellcaster]]", "mage" implies a use of [[Arcane|arcane]] [[Magic|magic]] by the subject, rather than the use of [[Divine|divine]] or [[Psychic|psychic]] magic.
> In common parlance, mage will most probably refer to a [[Wizard|wizard]], but might also suggest:

> - an [[Arcanist|arcanist]]
> - an [[Archmage|archmage]]
> - a [[Magus|magus]]
> - a [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]]
> - a [[Summoner|summoner]]
> Less likely, it might refer to another type of arcane spellcaster.
> "Arcanist", as a term, might also be used similarly to mage to indicate a generic arcane spellcaster, but there is a specific class also called [[Arcanist|arcanist]]. Likewise, "[[Magus|magus]]" is a related term also used by a specific class. There is no specific class called "mage".


## Specific uses of the word "mage"


### Classes and prestige classes

> Mage is sometime used in forming the name of a [[Class|class]] or a [[Prestige class|prestige class]], such as [[Archmage|archmage]], [[Bloatmage|bloatmage]] or [[Cyphermage prestige class|Cyphermage]].


### Spells and items

> Mage is also used to describe many [[Spell|spells]], such as *mage hand*, *mage's private sanctum*; and [[Magic item|magic items]], like the *hand of the mage*.


### Creatures

> The names of some creatures include the word "mage", such as [[Ogre mage|ogre mage]] or [[Clockwork mage|clockwork mage]].


## A note on use

> In English, "mage" derives from magus, and so "magi" and "mages" are both permissible pluralizations. However, due to the existence of the [[Magus|magus]] class, "magi" should be reserved for the plural form of magus to avoid ambiguity.
