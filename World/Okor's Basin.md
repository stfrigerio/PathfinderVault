> **Okor's Basin**, also known as the breadbasket of the north, is the most populous region of [[Iobaria]]. A fertile depression that slopes towards the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]] from the western [[Coreth Wood]], the [[Icerime Peaks]], and the [[Syrzemyan Highlands]], the region is protected from the worst of the arctic winds. [[Human|human]] settlers farm hardy breeds of [[Cattle|cattle]] and crops, including dwarf strains of barley, wheat, and rye. Wild cattle herds also roam across the region as legacy of failed [[Avistan|western]] settlements. 
> Once the Basin was dominated by the sprawling [[Storith Wood]], but much of the forest covering the Basin was logged away as more settlers arrived and the nearby city of [[Orlov]] expanded. Much of the region's human population lives either along the [[Nirrus River]] in the southwest, or close or Orlov, north of the remaining Storith Woods.
> [[Rashalka]] [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaur]] occasionally range through the Basin.
