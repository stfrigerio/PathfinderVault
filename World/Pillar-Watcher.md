> The **Pillar-Watchers** of [[Kibwe]] are soapstone statues perched atop namesake pillars across the city. Legends suggest the statutes, which are shaped in the forms of animalistic [[Humanoid|humanoids]], would come to life under times of great need, though this has never been known to occur. They primarily serve as [[Language|language]]-neutral navigational aids within the chaotic city.
