 The Laws of Mortality in tablet form.
> The **Laws of Mortality** are a list of edicts created in [[2555 AR]] in response to the devastation caused by the religious [[Oath Wars]] in northwest [[Garund]]. The Laws' authors include the philosopher [[Kalim Onaku]] and the militia of [[Azir]]. Although the Laws do not refute the existence of the [[Divine|divine]], they forbid anyone from worshiping any [[Deity|god]] or other divine being. They are most widely used by the nation of [[Rahadoum]] and were instrumental in the country's founding.
> Within the nation of Rahadoum, the Laws are enforced by the [[Pure Legion]], a trained militia who search any ship entering the country for religious paraphernalia, and harshly prosecute anyone caught proselytizing. However, as the gods are a powerful force in Golarion, this has not completely eradicated their worship. Native Rahadoumis find themselves called to a faith, and the country is also a tempting target for missionaries from all over the [[Inner Sea region]]. Small groups of worshipers exist throughout the land, but all are highly secretive.
