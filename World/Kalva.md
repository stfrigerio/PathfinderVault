**Kalva** is a large island off the southern coast of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Icemark]] that is inhabited by [[Cannibalism|cannibals]] called [[Kalvaman|Kalvamen]]. The island is disowned by Icemark, due to the degenerate nature of the Kalvamen, who are ruled by Old Crone Mavkaii. The inhabitants of Icemark claim that the [[Deity|gods]] themselves separated Kalva from the mainland in order to keep the cannibals segregated, and that the Kalvamen serve as guardians or servants of an unknown creature.
