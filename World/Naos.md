> Disparagingly called the "new-money district" by the city's more established nobles the **Naos** is actually one of the nicest, best maintained parts of the city. It lies in the wealthy area known as the [[Summit Magnimar district|Summit]] and is centred around the [[Avenue of Hours]]. it is bordered by the [[Alabaster District]] to the north, and the [[Capital District]] to the north west. The rest of the Naos borders are made up either by the natural barrier of the [[Fogwall Cliffs]] to the east or the city walls to the south. The district is home to both great public spaces like the [[Starsilver Plaza]] and the [[Lord-Mayor's Menagerie|Lord-Mayors Menagerie]] and great buildings like the [[Triodea]] and the [[Heidmarch Manor]] which serves as a [[Pathfinder lodge|lodge]] for members of the [[Pathfinder Society]].
