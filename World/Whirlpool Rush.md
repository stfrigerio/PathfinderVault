The **Whirlpool Rush** is a seaside cataract at the [[Nalt's Island|Nalts Island]] in the [[Shackles]]. It is located on the eastern end of the straits between [[Redbow Isle]] and Nalt's Island. Two sibling [[Charybdis|charybdises]] are said to be the cause of the perpetual vortex beneath the cataract. Sailors trying to avoid the hostile [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]]-plagued waters of [[Shark Island]], dare the straits between Redbow Isle and Nalt's Island and often meet their doom beneath the crashing waves of the whirlpool.
