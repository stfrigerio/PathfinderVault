> **Redroof** is a district in the southern half of [[Kintargo]]; it is unique due to its buildings being constructed from red river brick (hence the name Redroof) rather than the silver-flecked white limestone used throughout the rest of the city. There are still a few buildings within the district not built of brick, particularly notable is the derelict [[Hocum's Fantasmagorium|Hocums Fantasmagorium]]. Redroof is a lower-class neighbourhood, the red brick used is significantly cheaper than Kintargan limestone making the district more affordable but, unfortunately, the buildings hold up less well during the summer and winter extremes. Redroof is also home to Kintargo's notorious [[Tiefling|tiefling]] slum, the [[Devil's Nursery|Devils Nursery]], as well as the [[Cloven Hoof Society]] who fight to improve tiefling lives within the city.
