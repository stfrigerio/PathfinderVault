> The **Histaqen** is an ancient annual horse race that runs the length of the [[Pashman River]], from its traditional starting point within the city of [[Katheer]], east to a waypoint somewhere at the foot of the [[Zho Mountains]], across the river, and then all the way back toward Katheer again, following the north bank of the river. The winner of the race becomes a hero for the tribes of [[Plains of Paresh|Paresh]]. The prize for the race is revealed only to the winner by the Qadiran elders who organize the race. Cheating, either by magic or by skipping waypoints is punishable by death.
