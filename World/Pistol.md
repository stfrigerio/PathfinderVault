## Variants

> The **coat pistol** is an even smaller and weaker variant designed for concealment, and the **double-barreled pistol** allows it to be fired twice (or to fire two bullets at once).
> The dragon pistol fires pellets like a [[World/Items & Equipment/Weapons/Guns/Blunderbuss|blunderbuss]] rather than a bullet.
> The [[Rifle|rifle]] is the larger cousin of this gun. The pepperbox has a six rotating barrels for more rapid firing, while the [[Revolver|revolver]] is a more advanced cartridge-firing pistol with a similar size and automatically rotating chamber that can fire several successive shots.
