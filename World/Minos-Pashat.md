> **Minos-Pashat** is one of the Vaults of [[Orv]], the deepest layer of the [[Darklands]]. It is a remote Vault located south of the [[Black Desert]].
> The ceilings are unusually low in this Vault, never rising more than 40 feet from the ground. It often resembles a maze, with pillars, stalactites, stalagmites, fissures, and rock walls making passage difficult. In other parts, there are wide-open spaces, the comparatively close ceiling having no obvious means of support.
> At the centre of the Vault is a huge pillar of stone 1,000 feet in diameter. There is a massive [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine-banded]] door in the western side of the pillar, large enough for two [[Elephant|elephants]] to enter side-by-side. The [[Urdefhan|urdefhan]] believe that their race was born behind this door, created in a grand [[Daemon|daemonic]] experiment. As a result, Minos-Pashat is one of their most sacred places.


## Denizens

> The urdefhan do not live in their sacred Vault. Instead, priests and elders come here on pilgrimages and pray before the sacred door. Some are said to receive visions; others mysteriously disappear, leaving behind their belongings in a pile to the side of the door.
> [[Half-fiend|Half-fiends]] and their [[Daemon|daemon]] masters lair in some of the more easily fortified sections of the Vault. There are also [[Ooze|oozes]], giant [[Vermin|vermin]], and cave raptors.
