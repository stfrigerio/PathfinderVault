 Calistria's [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]]
> [[Elves]] and [[Half-elves|half-elves]] are common among the temple [[Prostitutes|prostitutes]] of the **Pleasure Salon of Calistria** in the [[Ascendant Court]] district of [[Absalom]]. Elves are otherwise relatively uncommon in Absalom, mostly consisting of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] or outcasts; more common are their half-elven descendants. Although [[Calistria|Calistrias]] [[Priest|priests]] play a significant role in the operations of the temple, the Pleasure Salon is managed by the ranking sacred prostitute, [[Dyrianna of House Avenstar]].



## Description

> The edifice is constructed in the colonnaded style of a classical [[Azlant|Azlanti]] temple to match the architecture of Absalom rather than elven cities. Its exterior is covered with bas-relief sculptures of hedonistic [[Humanoid|humanoids]], and it is rumored that the interior contains blasphemous sculptures of Calistria herself engaging in salacious activities with other [[Deities|deities]].


## Temple services


### Brothel

> The temple prostitutes are clean and well-educated, and offer their services on a sliding scale; they can develop a high social status in the city.


### Honey production

> The temple supplies honey—unusually made by [[Wasp|wasps]]—that is used by the city's [[Mead|mead]] brewers. The same breed of honey-producing wasps are also kept by the Scions of Revenge at the Calistrian temple of [[Imvrildara]] in [[Kyonin]].


### Public baths

> The Pleasure Salon provides public baths that have become a meeting-place for distrustful factions due to the temple's requirement for nudity within the baths.
