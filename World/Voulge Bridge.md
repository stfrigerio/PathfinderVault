> The old, historical **Voulge Bridge** that crossed the [[Kestrel River]] was demolished and replaced in [[4701 AR]] in the latest expansion of [[Castle Everstand]]. The new bridge is a two-span crossing 150 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 40 feet above the water level. With the construction of the [[Northwatch]] on the opposite side of the river, the bridge became part of the castle. The bridge is made of large blocks of ash-granite imported from [[Highhelm Militia]] and when it is wet its color is almost white, which is why the locals dub it the **Snow Bridge**.
