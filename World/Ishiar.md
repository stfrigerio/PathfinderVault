> Teeming multitudes of terrifying aquatic monsters haunt its lightless depths, including fiendish [[Tojanida|tojanidas]] and water-loving [[Hezrou|hezrous]] that swim through its depths and flop on its shores, but none is as fearsome as Dagon himself.  He resides in a sunken city called [[Ugothanok]], sending out his minions to the oceans of [[Golarion]] to wreak havoc and spread his foul seed.
> Ishiar's surface is a warred over by the Ishians, a race of fiendish and half-fiend humans who reside on the many islands that are found on the surface of the Abyssal Sea.
> Dagon's realm is one of the largest in all the Abyss, and wholly encompasses the realms of several other demon lords, including the [[Midnight Isles]] of [[Nocticula]], [[Gogunta|Goguntas]] realm of [[Mephizim]], the deceased [[Ibdurengian|Ibdurengians]] [[Slithering Pools]], and the [[Flensing Rocks]] of [[Ovonovo]]. [[Sifkesh|Sifkeshs]] realm of [[Vantian]] borders on Ishiar, and the great Abyssal ocean connects to the [[River Styx]].
