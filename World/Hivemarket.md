> The **Hivemarket** is a great bazaar located along the eastern foot of the [[Volcano|volcano]] [[Ka]], where merchants across [[Akiton]] can trade without having to pay taxes or care about any ruler. It exists both aboveground and in natural underground tunnels, the latter seem to have been formed from Ka's lava flows. The Hivemarket is protected by the khulans, who pay no attention to legitimate businesses (no matter how [[Evil|evil]]) but attack anyone who tries to take over the market by force. Akiton's [[Ysoki]] are regular merchants at the Hivemarket selling goods gathered from their interplanetary travels.
