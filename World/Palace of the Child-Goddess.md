> The **Palace of the Child-Goddess** is a flat-topped pyramid in the [[Ankar-Te]] [[Ring district|ring district]] of [[Kaer Maga]]. It is the home of at least one [[Child-goddess|child-goddess]], who is worshiped as a living [[Deity|deity]] within the city. Its single, massive door is the only way in and out. From there, windowless, metal palanquins allegedly bearing the child-goddess are carried through the streets multiple times a day, where the faithful believe her presence wards them from [[Evil|evil]] and danger. Whether the child-goddesses are actually carried within is not definitively known, as the metal palanquins have no windows and most members of the [[Cult of the Child-Goddess]] do not talk to outsiders.
> The Palace is overseen by the [[Shamalay Kasan|High Priestess Shamalay Kasan]], the only of the child-goddess's clergy who regularly interacts with the city's general populace.
