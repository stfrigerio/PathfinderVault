> The ***rope trick*** [[Spell|spell]] animates a rope between 5 and 30 feet in length to lift one end straight up into the air, where it hangs as though fixed to a higher point. At the top of the rope, the spell creates an [[Extradimensional|extradimensional]] space that exists outside of the [[Multiverse|multiverse]] capable of holding up to eight creatures of any size, while the rope can support up to 16,000 pounds of weight. Creatures inside this space cannot be seen from their [[Plane|plane]] of origin, including by [[Magic/Divination|divination]], but can look out through a one-way invisible window about 3 by 5 feet in dimension.
