> The **Hollow Tribunal** is a sturdy log building in the small town of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] in [[Andoran]]. [[Vamros Harg|Magistrate Vamros Harg]] dispenses merchant licenses, stamps mining and lumber claims, and passes judgment from Hollow Tribunal. It is known that Vamros obeys [[Thuldrin Kreed]]. Kreed put Harg in power with the understanding that he could remove him any time he wants. The residents do not trust the justice of Hollow Tribunal as Harg never dares oppose Kreed directly.
