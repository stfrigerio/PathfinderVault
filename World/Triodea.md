> The **Triodea** is by far the most important playhouse and concert hall in the whole of [[Magnimar]], and possibly all of western [[Varisia]]. It sits in the [[Summit Magnimar district|Summit]] region in Magnimar's [[Naos]] district, and its entrance is located on [[Starsilver Plaza]].  The venue is owned by [[Durstin Versade]]; although the [[Half-elf|half-elf]] counter-tenor and dancer [[Kassiel Iylmrain]] is the one who makes all the important decisions.


## Layout

> The building is divided into three performance spaces: the **Grand Stage**, the **Stonewall**, and the **Aerie**.  The Grand Stage is generally reserved for [[Opera|operas]] and [[Play|plays]].  The Stonewall is a concert hall known for its perfect acoustics, while the Aerie is a raised rooftop performance area used mostly by soloists.
