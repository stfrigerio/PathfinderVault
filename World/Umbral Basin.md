*For another meaning of "Umbral Basin", please see Umbral Basin (province).*
> The **Umbral Basin**, sometimes referred to as the **shadowlands**, is a wide mountain pass between the [[Mindspin Mountains]] to the north and the [[Menador Mountains]] to the south. It lies in [[Molthune]] and marks that nation's western border with [[Nidal]]. The region is notoriously dangerous, and rumors speak of shadowy [[Giant|giants]], bandits with their mouths sewn shut, and a reality-warping storm of black fog. Molthuni merchants bound for Nidal traverse the basin weekly, but do so under heavy guard.
