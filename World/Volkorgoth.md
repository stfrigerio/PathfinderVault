> **Volkorgoth** is an immense continent floating in the [[Chaos|chaos]] of the [[Maelstrom]]. It has its own ecology, gravity, and weather, and is the shared home of the countless [[Demigod|demigods]] worshipped by the [[Orc|orcs]], including the eight ones commonly worshipped on [[Golarion]]. All of these demigods claim their own realm, which is inhabited by [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]], [[Outsider|outsider]] servants, monsters, and the occasional [[Mortality|mortal]]; they constantly battle with others over territory. A great valley of a blood-red river serves as neutral ground for inhabitants, visitors, mercenaries, and [[Protean|proteans]] alike.
