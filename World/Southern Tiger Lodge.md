> The **Southern Tiger Lodge**, a [[Pathfinder lodge]] in [[Ramparassad]], [[Dtang Ma]], was founded by [[Nehari Siriwardana]] between [[4711 AR]] and [[4713 AR]] as a workshop to reverse-engineer [[Clockwork|clockwork]] devices recovered from [[Pan Majang]]. The lodge grew over time as she recruited others to help in her work, and was eventually brought under the management of the larger [[Lantern Lodge]].
