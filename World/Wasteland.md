> The **Wasteland** is an inhospitable desert of polychromatic sand that surrounds the [[Axis|Eternal City of Axis]], but is still considered to be part of the [[Plane|plane]]. It is dotted with crumbling ruins and the corpses of [[Titan|titans]] who invaded Axis in the earliest days of [[Great Beyond|creation]]. Travellers into the Wasteland have to cope with both dangerous intruders from the [[Maelstrom]] and dangerous antipode storms.
