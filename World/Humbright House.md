> **Humbright House** was one of a number of smaller shrines to [[Aroden]] that once dotted [[Kintargo|Kintargos]] [[Temple Hill Kintargo|Temple Hill]] district but now lies abandoned after the [[Deity|gods]] death. Humbright House used to serve as a combination shrine and orphanage but has lain abandoned since [[4606 AR]], since then it has periodically served as a base for all sorts of miscreants. Its current inhabitants, the [[Red Jills]], are a perfect example of this, a rough band of violent thugs led by an exiled [[Strix|strix]] named [[Scarplume]]. The interior of the buildings has been completely burned out stripping it of its first floor.
