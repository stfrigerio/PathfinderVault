> **Ritualists** are [[Spell|spellcasters]] who focus their skills on [[Occult ritual|occult rituals]], making these spells less likely to fail or cause unintended harm. Because of the vast knowledge, [[Time|time]], and training needed to become one, all ritualists have to be members of esoteric orders, though their studies often lead them down paths avoided by their peers in the [[Occultism|occult]]. Ritualists regularly risk death (or worse) by interacting with dangerous [[Magic|magic]], but the most powerful ones can learn and perform rituals at an unmatched speed. Some ritualists are particularly fatalistic, obsessive, or unpredictable in search of occult power, often endangering their peers and leading to their ostracism from occult societies.
