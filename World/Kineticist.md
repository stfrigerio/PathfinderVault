> **Kineticists** channel raw [[Element|elemental]] power and matter of the [[Ethereal Plane]] and into their bodies, manifesting in strange effects known as **kinesis**. Their powers often confuse others into believing they are [[Monk|monks]] or [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]].



## Becoming a kineticist

> Kinesis is seldom inherited, and powers are often initially exhibited during great stress or trauma. Most must master their abilities on their own, as experienced kineticists are rare. The form of kinesis is often linked to locations of great psychic or elemental power.


## Kinesis

> Kineticists draw their power from the Elemental Plane, but this power takes the form of elemental matter or energy.


## Forms of kinesis

> Most kineticists specialize in one of five elements: air (**aerokinesis** and **aerokineticists**), water (**hydrokinesis** and **hydrokineticists**), earth (**geokinesis** and **geokineticists**), fire (**pyrokinesis** and **pyrokineticists**), or [[Aether|aether]] (**telekinesis** and **telekineticists**).

 A [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]] chaokineticist.
> Others specialize in regionally prominent elements, such as the void (**chaokineticists**, specific to [[Minkai]]) and wood (**phytokineticists**, in [[Tian Xia]]). While **venokineticists**, especially found in [[Nagajor]], use the elements to create [[Poison|poisons]] (**venokinesis**). These powers are further shaped by the kineticist's wild talents.
> The most talented kineticists can transcend their specialization to manipulate any element, though the process inflicts greater strain than manipulating their preferred element. This is known as **omnikinesis**.
> Some kineticists can further specialize their art. For instance, hydrokinetics who specialize in manipulating the water in blood can devastate blood-bearing creatures or become supernaturally talented surgeons.


### Wild talents

*See also: [[Psychic magic]]*
> Kinesis manifests in many forms, but the most common are known as **wild talents**. Similar to [[Psychic magic|psychic magic]] [[Spell|spells]], wild talents are kinetic manifestations of the kineticist's innate abilities. The most fundamental wild talents are blasts of elemental power, and kineticists can meld multiple elements into a blast. Other wild talents can take protective forms or infuse their kinesis with more complex interactions. For instance, an experienced aerokineticist can form a simple gust of wind, but can also surround themselves with swirling winds or even create a violent cyclone.


## Regions

> Kineticists can be found anywhere, but in the [[Inner Sea region]] outside of [[Jalmeray]] and larger cities, they are either rare or easily confused with other disciplines. However, kineticists are both more common and greatly respected in [[Tian Xia]].


## Races

> There are no restrictions on the race of a kineticist.


## Religions

> There are no religious restrictions on kineticists.
