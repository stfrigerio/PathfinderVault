 [[Silver]] is anathema to [[Werewolf|werewolves]], so hopefully [[Feiya]] and [[Merisiel]] remembered to bring some.
> Some creatures, particularly [[Outsider|outsiders]], have specific vulnerabilities known as **anathemas**. Commonly known anathemas include [[Silver|silvers]] effects against [[Lycanthrope|lycanthropes]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Devil|devils]]; [[Sun|sunlight]]'s effects on [[Vampire|vampires]]; and [[Cold iron|cold irons]] effects against [[Daemon|daemons]], [[Demon|demons]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fey|fey]].
> **Anathematic substances** are often incorporated into [[Weapon|weapons]] designed to harm outsiders, and *magic circles* used to [[Binding outsiders|bind]] or ward against them.
