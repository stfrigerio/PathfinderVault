> The four [[Demigod|demigods]] now referred to as the **goblin hero-gods** were initially minor [[Barghest|barghest]] deities in the service of [[Asmodeus]]. The four found that when they killed [[Mortal|mortal]] creatures, the spilled blood turned into [[Goblin|goblins]]. They swiftly secured the loyalty of their new creations. To gain their loyalty, [[Lamashtu]] created [[Basalfeyst]], a realm in the [[Abyss]], and gifted it to the four demigods. In return, they made sure the goblins worshipped Lamashtu. Today, most goblins revere Lamashtu above all others, and recognise the four hero gods as equal secondary deities. However, a few tribes have favourites amongst the hero gods, and some even revere one or more of them ahead of Lamashtu.
