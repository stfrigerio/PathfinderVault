 The symbol of Irori, the Perfect Human, head of the Vudran pantheon.
> The [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]] are vast and contain over a hundred small kingdoms known as [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapadas]] ruled by [[Rajah|rajahs]] subservient to an almighty emperor called the maharajah. Even greater, however, is the number of [[Deities|deities]] worshipped in the land: some estimate more than a thousand, while others place the magnitude at over ten thousand forming a massive pantheon of conflicting ideas. Vudran [[Cleric|clerics]] claim that they have been guided by their gods for over 50,000 years, though some Vudran exaggeration may conflate this figure. At [[Hemachandra|Hemachandra Seat of the Golden Moon]] the entire pantheon comes together: it is thought that the tower contains a shrine to every Vudran deity.


## Irori

> At the head of the Vudran pantheon is [[Irori]], Master of Masters, a god so powerful he is also widely worshipped as a major deity within the [[Inner Sea region]] and in [[Tian Xia]].


## Worship outside Vudra

> A handful of other Vudran deities are known in the Inner Sea region, primarily through contact with the Vudran enclave at [[Jalmeray]]. Nevertheless, scholars of the Inner Sea region are only beginning to scrape the surface of their understanding of this vast pantheon.
