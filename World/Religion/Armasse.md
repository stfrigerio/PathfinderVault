 Aroden's holy symbol.
> The raucous, week-long festival known as **Armasse** is held each year beginning on 16 [[Holidays and festivalsArodus|Arodus]]. The celebration—once dedicated to the god [[Aroden]]—is still important to the faithful of [[Iomedae]], who use it to train commoners in combat, ordain apprentice clergy, pick squires for knights, and teach military history, hoping to prevent the mistakes of the past from being repeated. Among those not dedicated to the [[Iomedae|Inheritor]] the holiday has lost most of its religious significance since Aroden's death, tending now only toward wild partying, a fact that has precluded the diabolist authorities of [[Cheliax]] from prohibiting Armasse outright. Nevertheless, in places where the church of [[Asmodeus]] is openly allowed, it hosts special activities for its parishioners during the same week in an effort to counter the influence of the holiday. The city of [[Corentyn]] is especially known for its extravagant Armasse festivities.
