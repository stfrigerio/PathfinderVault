> A chaotic neutral character follows his whims; he is an individualist, beholden to no one. He values his own liberty but doesn't actively strive to protect freedom as that would make them [[Chaotic good|chaotic good]]. He avoids authority, resents any sort of law or restriction, and challenges confining traditions. A chaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy as such an action would have to be motivated either by good (a desire to liberate others or destroy tyranny) or evil (and a desire to make those who oppose him suffer just for the sake of it). A chaotic neutral character may be unpredictable, but his behaviour is not random, he has his own goals and aims and he will stick to them, even if they change regularly or do not coincide with those of his society.


## Gods

> [[Gorum]] is probably the best example of a chaotic neutral [[Deity|deity]], obsessed with the chaos of battle and fighting he cares not for what cause he fight just as long as he fights. He will change sides on a whim just as long as the war and fighting does not cease. Other chaotic neutral deities include [[Calistria]] and [[Besmara]] each with their own agenda's quite separate from conventional morality.


## Outsider

> Embodiments of the endless creative and destructive possibilities of pure chaos the [[Protean|proteans]] embody chaos untainted by any sort of morality much like the [[Maelstrom]] they call home.


> [[Paizo]] published *[[Faiths of Balance]]* regarding [[Deity|deities]] aligned on the ethical axis of neutrality, *[[Champions of Balance]]* regarding people and organizations aligned on the ethical axis of neutrality, and *[[Concordance of Rivals sourcebook|Concordance of Rivals]]* regarding neutrally aligned [[Plane|planes]] and creatures.
