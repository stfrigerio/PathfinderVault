> **Igramalash** is the first and most powerful of the [[Inverted giant|inverted giants]] created by [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Alderpash]].


## History

> Igramalash was one of the first [[Rune giant|rune giants]]. In [[-6310 AR]], when he failed Alderpash, the runelord called a powerful nameless [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] to turn Igramalash inside out and infuse him with [[Abyss|Abyssal]] power, creating the first inverted giant. Later inverted giants created by the other [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] runelords never matched Igramalash.
> For many years afterwards, Igramalash served Alderpash faithfully and came to be seen as a [[Deity|god]] by other inverted giants. However, around [[-6267 AR]], Igramalash betrayed Alderpash again, and was given to Alderpash's new patron, the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Baphomet]], for eternal imprisonment within the [[Ivory Labyrinth]]. His entire body except for his inverted mouth was transformed into gaseous form, left in stasis, blind and deaf to his surroundings.
