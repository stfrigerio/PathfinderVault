> **Apsu** is the patron [[Deity|deity]] of all [[Good|good]] and [[Metallic dragon|metallic dragons]], and one of the oldest gods of the [[Great Beyond]]. According to the [[Dragon|draconic]] creation myth, he was one of the primordial dragons who created the [[Solar system|solar system]] and its inhabitants from the chaos of the [[Material Plane]].



## History



> According to draconic lore, Apsu and [[Dahak]] were the two creator-dragons who made more of their own kind, from the [[Chromatic dragon|chromatic dragons]] to lesser ones like [[Drake|drakes]]. When [[Rovagug]] rampaged across [[Golarion]], they joined the fight and were able to defeat him, but Rovagug's touch corrupted Dahak. Dahak then vowed to kill Apsu, who declared that Golarion would be their battlefield; the battle between Apsu and Dahak still rages on Golarion.


## Home

> Apsu makes his home in the [[Immortal Ambulatory]], a [[Demiplane|demiplane]] of wandering stars and floating islands that moves about from plane to plane in the [[Great Beyond]]. The Immortal Ambulatory can embed itself in different planes, and can often be found in [[Heaven]]. Apsu is most often found in the Opalescent Cathedral, which resides on an island at the center of the demiplane.


## Appearance

> Apsu appears as a regal [[Silver dragon|silver dragon]] dwarfing the largest great wyrms. His scales sparkle with a pearlescent glow.


## Relationships

> Apsu maintains strong relationships with good deities, in particular [[Lawful good|lawful]] ones like [[Torag]]. [[Sarenrae]] remembers his contribution to imprisoning Rovagug in the Dead Vault. [[Cayden Cailean]] views the coming battle between Apsu and Dahak as a 'good rumble'; while [[Gorum]] sees it as a war where his followers could fight. [[Iomedae]] approached him after she completed the [[Test of the Starstone]], seeking to ask him to get involved more deeply in worldly affairs; although a formal alliance is impossible due to Apsu's focus on the battle against Dahak, the two deities still agreed to defend each other, symbolised by Iomedae's [[Gold dragon|gold dragon]] servant [[Peace through Vigilance]].
> Apsu and Dahak are arch-enemies, the two having battled countless times across history. They once worked together to imprison Rovagug, but Dahak has no intention of ever doing this again and focuses his entire existence on the eventual final battle against Apsu.
> [[Asmodeus]], the only evil god known to approach Apsu, has offered his services for some unknown reason and price, but Apsu has politely refused every time. It is rumoured that he has offered to weaken both Apsu for Dahak and Dahak for Apsu, making his true intent unclear.


## Church of Apsu

> Unsurprisingly, most of Apsu's worshipers are metallic dragons, although some non-aligned draconic creatures such as [[Primal dragon|primal dragons]] and [[Wyvern|wyverns]] worship him as well. Few dragons practice [[Divine magic|divine magic]], preferring to leave that to their [[Humanoid|humanoid]] allies. As Apsu's prime purpose is the destruction of Dahak, few non-dragons take up his cause, although honourable [[Humanoid|humanoids]] with an interest in draconic lore have taken up his faith from time to time. They typically wear a [[Gold|gold]] dragon's foot brooch, or have other custom-made equipment in the shape of a dragon's foot.
> Golarion lacks much of a centralized [[Humanoid|humanoid]] church of Apsu. The largest congregation of humanoid Apsu worshipers on the planet is known as the Platinum Band, which maintains relatively small centers of worship in [[Oppara]] and [[Absalom]]. Apsu is more widely worshiped by humanoids on the [[Planet|planet]] [[Triaxus]], where he is the patron deity of the [[Dragon Legion]]. The Legion's leaders prohibit their priests from revealing Apsu's connection to Golarion, so younger legionnaires would not be tempted to prematurely journey there to help him. Instead, they hope to raise a grand army to offer Apsu when the time comes for him to fight Dahak.
> [[Brass dragon|Brass dragons]], gregarious in the extreme, generally fill the role as Apsu's servants and diplomats, although few of them could be considered particularly devout. Nevertheless, they always come when they are needed.
> The church's holy text is the *[[Draconic Apsu]]*, an epic poem written by the blind [[Gold dragon|gold dragon]] sage [[Gunnarrex]].  Both the first day of the [[Winter solstice|winter solstice]] and the first day of summer are considered holy days by the church.


## Followers

> Apsu's [[Herald|herald]] is Oreganus, a bespectacled [[Celestial|celestial]] [[Silver dragon|silver dragon]] with the ability to create solid fortifications with his breath.
> Apsu's other planar allies include:

> - Blameless Flame
> - Syrax the Platinum

> [[Paizo]] published a major article on Apsu in *[[Inner Sea Faiths]]*.
