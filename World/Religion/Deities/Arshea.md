> The [[Angel|angel]] [[Empyreal Lord|empyreal Lord]] **Arshea** (pronounced AHR-shey) is a champion of the repressed and weary, providing [[Mortal|mortals]] deliverance from their bonds. This liberation applies to many of Arshea's worshipers, who often choose to ignore conventional gender identities, eventually choosing one that fits them best.



## Home

> Arshea has no permanent home, and constantly travels through the [[Material Plane]], [[Nirvana]], [[Elysium]] and [[Heaven]].


## Appearance

> Arshea is androgynous and has been depicted as both male and female, but in either case, always dressed in many-colored veils of gossamer. Indeed, Arshea is of both genders and neither, unhindered by such differences. Arshea has a perfect face, a lithe body, and wings of gray and blue. Their form is seen as ideal by any species that look upon them, and some claim that those who directly behold Arshea can never be satisfied with mortal beauty again.


## Providence

> Miserable individuals sometimes receive a sign of hope from Arshea in the form of a soft grey feather, jewelled bangle, or scrap of gossamer.


## Relationships

> Arshea is a welcome guest at the empyreal lord [[Lymnieris]] [[Palace of Delectation]] in Heaven and such visits are legendary concerning the intensity of the revels held.


## Church of Arshea

> Arshea is worshipped by artisans, [[Courtesan|courtesans]], some [[Fey|fey]], and those seeking to escape repression. They eschew gender roles and often dress and behave as members of the opposite sex (or another gender role in societies with multiple gender roles) for a period of time ranging from months to decades, which they consider the best way to overcome repression and understand freedom, choosing the most fitting gender after this period of pilgrimage. Arshea teaches them to abandon constraining beliefs and practice free love and sexuality.
> The Spirit of Abandon's temples are most likely found in [[Art|artists studios]], burlesque parlors, and dance halls. Arshea's most devout followers endeavor to achieve sexual release daily (either solo or with partners), praise the beauty of the partners and self, and pray to Arshea while naked.
> Arshea's favored minions are [[Aasimar's Mercy|aasimar]] [[Enchanter|enchanters]], [[Astral deva|astral devas]], and good-aligned [[Bestiary/Nymph|nymphs]].


### On Golarion

> The cult of Arshea has a long association with [[Magnimar]].
