> **Primordial inevitables**, sometimes termed **primal inevitables**, were the first [[Inevitable|inevitables]] produced by [[Axiomite|axiomites]], and are the most powerful and authoritative among their kind. They are living forges who create lesser inevitables that serve their strict interpretations and enforcement of cosmic [[Law|law]].



## Habitat and ecology

> Guided by the same [[Godmind]] as their axiomite creators, primordial inevitables serve and protect [[Axis]] and its residents against the entropy of [[Chaos|chaos]] by targeting emerging cosmic threats. Their numbers are limited, dwindling, and unreplenishing—the lore to create them is so ancient that it has been lost to the axiomites, each destruction is permanent — and all other inevitables work to protect them. Little more than a quarter of all primordial inevitables remain in the wake of this eternal conflict. Many of the destroyed primordial inevitables are memorialized in inscriptions around Axis, although some have been forgotten entirely.
> They live in bastions within Axis, and when not working, inevitables of all kinds congregate around these homes.


## As demigods

> Each unique primordial inevitable has become so powerful that they have ascended to become [[Demigod|demigods]], and have [[Mortal|mortal]] worshipers.
> These mortal worshipers often appreciate the meditative precision of primordial inevitables, though they rarely attract [[Paladin|paladins]] due to their ambivalence between the moral spectrum of [[Good|good]] and [[Evil|evil]].


### Bailiff sects

> While mortal worshipers of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Monitor|monitors]] typically refer to themselves as [[Proctor|proctors]], worshipers of primordial inevitables refer to themselves as "**bailiffs**". The primordial inevitables who foster **bailiff sects** of mortal worshipers do so to leverage the redundancies in having multiple active groups.
> Bailiff sects model the laws and order of Axis in the [[Material Plane]], putting them in relentless opposition with anarchists, criminals, the corrupt, and radicals. They pursue these goals through the pursuit of [[Mathematics|mathematics]], accounting, and legal studies, fields that often also bring them considerable wealth that many (at least, those who do not themselves succumb to corruption) re-invest into their communities. They readily work alongside local law enforcement, but take special joy in helping inevitables pursue cosmic disorder.
> On [[Golarion]], these sects are most common in [[Egorian]], [[Cheliax]]; [[Kerse]], [[Druma]]; and [[Sothis]], [[Osirion]].
