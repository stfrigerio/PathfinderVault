> **Picoperi** is an [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azata]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] who delights in jokes and surprises, and finds joy in taunting [[Evil|evil]].



## Home

> Picoperi lives inside a kapok tree on [[Elysium]]. Carved into its trunk is a network of comfortable rooms, despite its small outward size.


## Appearance

> Picoperi can take any form but usually prefers that of a young brown-skinned, black-haired [[Elf|elven]] boy. He is never seen without his woollen vest, dyed bright green and yellow, decorated with images of llamas, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]], and tree [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Frog|frogs]]. In battle, he prefers ambushes and [[Trap|traps]], and employs darts that cause laughter and euphoria.


## Relationships

> Legend has it that [[Urxehl]] smiled at one of Picoperi's jokes millennia ago, and the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] been trying to destroy Picoperi ever since.


## Cults

> Picoperi is worshipped by [[Good|good]] people who look at the world with wonder and delight. Some inventors, particularly [[Alchemist|alchemists]] who employ jungle [[Plant|plant]] extracts, let his surprises lead them to new discoveries.
