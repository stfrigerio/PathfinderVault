> **Yhidothrus**, the Ravager Worm, is the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of age, [[Time|time]], and worms. A being full of hate, he is concerned with everything wrong about time and the process of aging: the destructive power of erosion and entropy's ability to bring all to naught.



## Appearance

> Yhidothrus is a massive, black-skinned worm with a maw filled with arrayed teeth, hidden by a mouth that folds back when the demon lord bares its jaws. The tail of the worm is indescribable, as those that have seen it are turned [[Mad|mad]]. The accounts of these lunatics all seem to describe that Yhidothrus grows more ancient as one travels alongside its body, and its tail is rooted in a deep [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]]-ruled [[Abyssal realm]] where the very ideas of sin and [[Demon|demons]] have not yet existed. Scholars speculate that Yhidothrus is still a [[Qlippoth lord|qlippoth lord]] at the end of his body, and could possibly encircle the entire [[Great Beyond]] if he could climb out of his source. According to the most disturbing rumours, Yhidothrus' 'body' is nothing more than the tip of the tongue of an incomparably vast monster.


## Home

> Yhidothrus has a unique Abyssal realm in that it spans many other realms: the [[Spiral Path]] is a labyrinth of tunnels cut through the [[Outer Sphere]]. They may connect to every other Abyssal realm and even be bored into the depths of other [[Plane|planes]] of the Outer Sphere. The deeper into the Spiral Path, the more qlippoth and the fewer demons can be encountered. None has managed to travel all the way down the Spiral Path to the source of Yhidothrus; if they have, these people have never returned, or are unable or willing to say what they saw there.


## Cult and worshippers

> [[Human]] cultists of the Ravager Worm tend to be an isolated few: loners fearful of old age desperate to prevent its ravages by turning to the worship of demons, and becoming [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|liches]] or [[Worm that walks|worms that walk]]. Liches of Yhidothrus tend to have a more disgusting appearance than normal ones: wetter and more worm-eaten. Yhidothrus' cultists are afraid of their patron, and rarely dare contact him or call upon his powers.
> Some [[Conqueror worm|conqueror worm]] sects see Yhidothrus as their origin, and control nations in his name, instead of in their own name like normal conqueror worms.
