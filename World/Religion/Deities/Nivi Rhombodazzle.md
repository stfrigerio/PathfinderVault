> **Nivi Rhombodazzle** is the only [[Gnome|gnomish]] racial [[Deity|deity]], though she is primarily revered among subterranean gnomes who live in the [[Darklands]].
> She appears as a subterranean gnome with eyes that glimmer like [[Gem|gems]]. Her [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] is a gem cut into the shape of a six-sided die with seven pips on one side.



## History

> Nivi was once an ordinary [[Mortal|mortal]] gnome with a penchant for gambling and games of chance. She was not addicted to winning so much as playing the game. Unfortunately, this attitude led her to owe a lot of [[Money|money]] to a lot of people, which eventually forced her to flee from some of her more powerful creditors. 
> She eventually found her way into the Darklands, where she was amazed by the wonders and incredible sights contained therein. She became the first gnome to stave off the effects of the [[Bleaching]] by fully embracing her new life below the surface of Golarion.
> She traded a special gem to [[Torag]] in exchange for becoming a [[Demigod|demigoddess]].


## Myths

> Scholars have speculated that Nivi Rhombodazzle is somehow responsible for the population of gnomes native to the [[Material Plane]]. One theory suggests the first such gnomes were tricked into passing through a temporary breach from the [[First World]], and the culprit might have been Nivi.


## Realm

> Nivi’s affinity for earth and caves is reflected in her home on the [[Plane of Earth]], but she is unusual among the gods
for not maintaining a stable divine realm of her own. Instead, Nivi tends to set up temporary residence in massive, jewel-studded caverns deep within the Eternal Delve or on the Material Plane in between extended journies in search for perfect [[Gemstone|gemstones]] and high-stakes gambling.


## Followers

> Nivi is widely worshiped among subterranean gnomes, but a smaller population of surface gnomes—most of whom are [[Adventurer|adventurers]] who regularly deal with subterranean gnomes—even know of her divinity. Gnomes in danger of succumbing to the [[Bleaching|bleaching]] might also follow Nivi in hopes of finding inspiration in pursuit of chance. Gamblers and other roguish folk of any race might also carry her holy symbol in homage to her, if not in worship.
> Her followers might also carry a *rhombocrystal*, a [[Magic item|magical]] color-shifting lens.


### Church

> Nivi is a goddess of community, and her worshipers organize into tight-knit, distinct groups with their own greetings and traditions. Among her churches are the Cult of the Shining Diamond and the Blue Twilight.


### Planar Allies

> Nivi's herald is Seven-Eyes, a sapient magical die who has accompanied Nivi since her days as a mortal, and it is said that he is the template upon which all Nivian holy symbols are based.
> She is also served by Quiet, a powerful subterranean gnome rogue rumored to be one of Nivi's relatives during her mortal life, and the earth-elemental-infused sparkletop mole Rummbrrlar, a unique sparkletop mole with a body of pure diamond who is capable of changing size.
