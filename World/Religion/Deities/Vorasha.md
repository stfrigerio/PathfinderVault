> **Vorasha the Ophidian** is the most powerful of the [[Harbinger|harbingers]] (a pantheon of [[Daemon|daemonic]] [[Demigod|demigods]] capable of granting [[Divine magic|divine magic]]); she is a servant and sometimes lover of the [[Four Horsemen|Horseman]] [[Trelmarixian]].



## Home

> Vorasha's realm, the Writhing Palace, is a wing of the Withered Court, Trelmarixian's realm on [[Abaddon]]. This fecund garden is infested with [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|serpents]] from the entire [[Great Beyond]], and no one knows precisely what transpires within.


## Appearance

> Vorasha appears as a [[Meladaemon|meladaemon]] with [[Dragon|draconic]] scales and scarlet-and-emerald [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]] for hair.


## Relationships

> Vorasha is the consort of Trelmarixian, and seeks to become a Horseman in her own right. However, she is unaware of the infection of Trelmarixian's essence inside herself: he is aware of all of her actions and might have had a subtle influence on her rise to power.


## Cults


### Unholy symbol

> Vorasha's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is the head of a [[Jackal|jackal]] encircled by an [[Ouroboros|ouroboros]], a snake eating its own tail.
