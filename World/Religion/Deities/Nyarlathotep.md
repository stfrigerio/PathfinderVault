> **Nyarlathotep** is one of the [[Outer God|Outer Gods]] of the [[Dark Tapestry]] who takes on thousands of forms, each having its own cult, [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]], and favoured [[Weapon|weapon]]. Unlike the other Outer Gods, Nyarlathotep seems to enjoy manipulating [[Mortal|mortals]] and driving them to [[Madness|madness]]. It is believed that he is has prepared for the apocalyptic return of [[Great Old One|Great Old Ones]] on countless [[Planet|planets]].



## Appearance

> The [[Deity|gods]] most notorious forms on [[Golarion]] are:

> - The **Black Pharaoh**, a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] form
> - The **Faceless Sphinx**, a faceless [[Elephant|elephantine]] [[Sphinx|sphinx]]
> - The **Haunter of the Dark**, a [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bat]]-like entity with a tri-lobed burning eye

## Realm

> Nyarlathotep is the guardian and alleged caretaker of the strange gods of the [[Dreamlands]], who dwell in [[Kadath]], the impossible castle at the northern tip of the [[Leng|Plateau of Leng]]. Rumour also has it that he serves as the door ward to [[Azathoth]]. Few dare approach Kadath, and fewer return after meeting Nyarlathotep.


## The Church

> Worshippers of Nyarlathotep believe he is the [[Outer God]] who ties together the worship of the [[Great Old Ones]]. They also believe he will open the doors to the uncaring light of the [[Star|stars]]. Common worshippers are assassins, [[Poison|poisoners]], and demagogues to bring about the deaths of kings and reformers, moving the world towards [[Chaos|chaos]].


## On Golarion

> Nyarlathotep is particularly interested in [[Osirion]], where his influence is clearly visible: the Black Pharaoh is linked to many [[Witch|witch]] cults and has appeared to many [[Pharaoh|pharaohs]], including (allegedly) the incumbent [[Khemet III]]. It is believed that he was responsible for the [[Army of Exploration|Armies of Exploration]] that ultimately led to [[Taldor|Taldors]] decline, and the invention of [[Firearm|firearms]] by the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Dongun Hold]].
> In his Faceless Sphinx mask, Nyarlathotep was worshipped in [[Thassilon]] and had a vague influence. Currently, the Faceless Sphinx's cult is infiltrating the [[Drow|drow]] houses of [[Zirnakaynin]], where his worshippers hide in plain sight among their kin who still worship the [[Demon lord|demon lords]], and seek to convert the leaders of [[Sothis]] as well in order to to hasten the return of the Outer Gods.
