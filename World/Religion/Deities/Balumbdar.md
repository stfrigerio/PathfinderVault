> **Balumbdar** is a [[Deity|god]] of big things that tower over small things, and of strength born of great size. Creatures of great size and dominant natural features are sacred to him.



## Relationships

> Balumbdar is considered brutish and dim-witted by most other gods, but always commands respect due to his towering size.


## Appearance

> Balumbdar often takes the form of a giant of a man with slabs of muscle and equally thick rolls of fat, a city-sized [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Animal|animal]], or imposing clouds, heavy with rain and low to the ground.


## Cults

> While Balumbdar himself cares little about how great size is used, his followers are generally divided into two groups: [[Evil|evil]] ones who see it natural for the big to tread on the small, and [[Good|good]] ones who believe that the big have an obligation to protect the small. [[Rules/Classes/Druid|Druids]] who venerate Balumbdar for his connection to nature often adopt the care of animals much bigger or smaller than they are, to demonstrate his guardianship of small creatures.
> The Elephant People worship Balumbdar as the nameless divine patron who sent [[Elephant|elephants]] to the world to protect others. Balumbdar does not care that these people have no name for him, and speaks to them through the elephants that serve him.
