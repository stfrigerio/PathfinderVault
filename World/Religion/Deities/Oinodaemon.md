> The **Oinodaemon** (pronounced OIN-oh-day-mon) is the eldest and most mysterious of the [[Four Horsemen]] of [[Abaddon]]. The Four Horsemen once bowed to him as their creator and ruler until they rebelled, bound him at the heart of Abaddon and devoured his flesh.
> The Oinodaemon is rumoured to have more power than the other Four Horsemen combined, although only the Horsemen know for sure. The Oinodaemon is mentioned only in whispers for fear of somehow awakening the shackled beast.



## History

> According to the *[[Windsong Testaments]]*, the future First Daemon was one of the first deities of this incarnation of [[Great Beyond|reality]], but as death had yet to exist, the Prince was Bound to a throne in the [[Pharasma's Spire|Spires]] shadow to await his time. When these deities first turned their attention to the [[Material Plane]] to create [[Mortality|mortal]] life, the Bound Prince waited in the darkest place to welcome mortal death, although Abaddon started off empty, and remained so even as the first [[Soul|souls]] died and were judged by [[Pharasma]]. When [[Rovagug]] rampaged through creation, spreading death and devastation on a hitherto-unprecedented scale, the consequential vast influx of souls overflowed the banks of the [[River of Souls]] and they washed up on many places, including Abaddon, and never reached the [[Boneyard]]. According to the *Windsong Testaments*, the Bound Prince glutted upon these souls and became the First Horseman, while the *[[Book of the Damned]]* claims that a single such soul that entered Abaddon was filled with such hatred, rage, and self-loathing more than all the others combined, and coalesced into the first [[Daemon|daemon]]. It devoured otherwise [[Evil|evil]] souls to gain power and began to twist Abaddon into something as corrupt as himself and called fellow evil souls to him. These souls were unable to resist; most were eaten, while some became the first daemons.
> The daemons continued to consume the souls that washed up on Abaddon's shores, and the Oinodaemon taunted the [[Deity|gods]] that all souls that came to Abaddon would be devoured. Pharasma listened, and created the [[Eight Courts|Devouring Court]] within the Boneyard, where she sent the souls damned to Abaddon, delivering them to the Horsemen.


### Creation of the Horsemen

> As the daemons diversified in form and grew in number, the Oinodaemon created the first Horsemen as his chosen servants, who worked alongside their [[Deacon|deacons]] to satisfy the daemons' hunger for souls. Suspicious of the Horsemen's servitors, and still hungering for the River of Souls, the Oinodaemon created the [[Astradaemon|astradaemons]] to be his own deacons.


### Imprisonment

> The Four Horsemen saw this act as a sign of distrust and an insult from their leader. Eventually, the Four trapped the First in a hidden tower they call the Ruined Spire. The Oinodaemon's thrashings created, destroyed, and twisted many kinds of daemons, and [[Poison|poisoned]] whole portions of Abaddon and the [[Maelstrom]] beyond repair. The Four erased all mention of the Oinodaemon from the records, and few beings remember his existence. When they heard him speak for the first time since he was chained, the Four were so terrified that they barred the doorway leading to the Ruined Spire, only opening it when they alone come to visit and worship the Oinodaemon.


## Appearance

> The First Daemon's size and shape frequently change, depending on the Four's hunger and torture. Sometimes he is massive; other times he is merely [[Human|human]]-sized, and yet at other times he simply appears as darkness. In all such forms, the piercing red-violet eyes and ivory teeth are always present.
> Although the Four bound him and gorged themselves on his flesh, the Oinodaemon yet lives: the Four cannot simply seal him away and steal all of his power. His great, only remaining eye became the perpetual eclipse looming over and peering down on the surface of Abaddon, as his essence somehow merged with Abaddon itself. Although the Four rendered him powerless, he remains omnipresent and conscious, in constant pain. Within the Ruined Spire, the eye is open and focused on the surrounding coronal shadow.
