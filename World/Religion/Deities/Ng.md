*This article covers the [[Eldest]] [[Deity|deity]] Ng. For the [[Alignment|alignment]] abbreviated NG, see [[Neutral good]].*
> **Ng the Hooded** is a particularly mysterious member of the [[Eldest]]: divine [[Fey|fey]] creatures of tremendous power said to be able to reshape the very fabric of the [[First World]] on a whim. He is considered to be the herald of either a distant [[Deity|god]] or of the [[Plane|plane]] of the First World itself.



## History

> Few know anything about Ng's true nature, leading to many potentially conflicting theories: that Ng might be the ghost of a lost Eldest, an automaton, a servant of the Palace of Seasons, a herald of an absent deity, or the voice of a sentient First World or plane-spanning consciousness. Ng refuses to confirm or dispute any interpretation of his origin, history, or role among the Eldest.


## Relationships

> Ng interacts with others through cold logic, strange questions, and cryptic statements. He is known to travel and converse with [[Desna]], with whom he shares much in common. He also is welcome in [[The Lost Prince|The Lost Princes]] Crumbling Tower, and receives [[Ragadahn|Ragadahns]] invitations 
to research esoteric lore. None of the Eldest turn Ng away, though the rest of them remain wary of his inscrutable nature.


## Appearance

> Cloaked in secrecy, even the one visible part of his body—his gloves—is shrouded in mystery, with some maintaining the gloves hide clockwork mechanisms. His facial features are a true mystery. The only sign of his gender is his dispassionate voice, and he leaves no trail of footprints, only a trail of robes.


## Servants

> Ng's minions include brownies, bulabars, constructs, [[Grig|grigs]], and [[Huldra|huldra]].


## Worship of Ng

> Ng's followers faithfully worship him despite his exceedingly rare acknowledgement of them, leading some to question whether Ng is responsible for their [[Divine magic|divine magic]]. None of his followers know what Ng's plans or ends are.
> Those who venerate him take their roles as travelers seriously, in contrast to Desna's more carefree wanderers.


### Obedience

> Ng's most faithful followers always wear gloves or a veil. Those who do without interruption for more than a day at a time draw his favor when facing peril and injury.
> Particularly devout followers are able to move without impediment and travel between planes, and his most powerful worshipers can summon an [[Extradimensional|extradimensional]] forest labyrinth that provides supernatural sustenance.


### Temples

> Ng's temples are often based around crossroads, weathered stones, and trees in the middle of changing their colors.


> [[Paizo]] published an article about Ng on page 30 of *[[The First World Realm of the Fey]]*.
