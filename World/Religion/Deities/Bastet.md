> **Bastet** is the [[Osirian pantheon|Ancient Osirian goddess]] of [[Cat|cats]], desire, sensuality, and secrets. She protects against [[Diseases of Golarion|epidemics]], [[Evil|evil]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]]. She is usually relaxed and indolent, but Bastet's anger can be terrible.



## Appearance

> Bastet is a beautiful cat-headed woman carrying a sistrum and an aegis [[Shield|shield]] decorate with the head of a [[Lion|lion]].


## Relationships

 A Family Tree of the Osirian Pantheon.
> Bastet is the daughter of [[Ra]] and sister of [[Hathor]], [[Sekhmet]], and [[Maat]]. She has often faced off against [[Apep]] on her father's behalf. Bastet has no mate, but her affairs with numerous other [[Deity|deities]] are well-documented.


## Church of Bastet

> The worship of Bastet is particularly popular among women, and most of her [[Cleric|clergys]] are female. They usually keep cats as pets, and when these cats die, they are mummified and buried with their owners. Bastet's temples host elaborate, decadent festivals, and are home to sacred [[Prostitute|prostitutes]] of both sexes. Since the restoration of native Osirian rule in [[4609 AR]], interest in the worship of Bastet has been rekindled in that nation.
