> **Immonhiel** is the [[Angel|angel]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] patron of [[Medicine|medicine]]. She nurses to health her fellow [[Celestial|celestials]] injured in fights against [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]].



## Home

> Immonhiel has no fixed home and wanders where she is needed. She has visited the home of nearly every other empyreal lord, and many [[Mortality|mortals]] have unknowingly hosted her without being aware of their visitor's true nature.


## Appearance

> Immonhiel appears as a regal, elderly, brown-skinned woman. Her moss-green hair hangs in thick braids on both sides of her face, and her black eyes hold great wisdom. She wears a leather skirt and vest fringed with green [[Silk|silk]]. From her sash hangs innumerable pouches and [[Potion|potions]] said to contain all kinds of medicine. Immonhiel's right hand is made from pine wood, with long, capable-looking fingers.


## Servants

> Immonhiel's servants spread the knowledge of herbal remedies and how to tend them, and teach medics on the battlefield how to keep their patients alive. For those who cannot be saved, they provide ointments that give them the gift of a peaceful death.


## On Golarion

> A small cult of Immonhiel, known as the Silent Surgeons, practices in [[Azir]] using [[Medicine|non-magical healing]] to spread the faith among the [[Atheism|godless]] in [[Rahadoum]].
