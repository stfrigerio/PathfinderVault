> The ancient [[Deity|deity]] **Ydersius** (pronounced yeh-DER-see-us) is the patron of the [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]], a race of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake]]-like [[Monstrous humanoid|monstrous humanoids]] who battled [[Human|humans]] of ancient [[Azlant]] during the [[Age of Legend]]. A deity of unquenched passion and anger, the generally more cerebral serpentfolk used him as an example of all that was potent and primal in their psyche.



## History

> In the [[Age of Serpents]], Ydersius walked among his people as the embodiment of their might and power, commanded their armies to countless victories, raised great cities, and sired semi-divine offspring who ruled in their father's name.
> In one of the final battles of the war between the serpentfolk and the [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]], the mighty Azlanti champion [[Savith]] led an army to the depths of [[Garund]] and decapitated Ydersius in his hallowed sanctum of [[Ilmurea]]. However, Savith was unable to kill Ydersius. She threw his headless body to the lightless [[Darklands]] deep below, and cast his still-conscious skull into a lake of fire, before succumbing to his [[Venom|venom]]. His [[Cleric|clerics]] still receive [[Divine magic|divine magic]], a sure sign that he has not followed [[Aroden]] into true death.
> Although he was not yet dead, Ydersius' defeat marked the terminal decline of the serpentfolk empire. However, the serpentfolk have survived, and they vow to restore the Headless King. They believe that should his body and head be reunited, Ydersius would return to full power and lead his people in an attack against the surface world.
> According to the ancient legends of the [[Mwangi]], the [[Zenj]] folk hero [[Old-Mage Jatembe]] learned secrets from the severed head of Ydersius before sewing its lips shut.


## Home

> Yderius once made his home in [[Sydrixus]], a pocket [[Plane|plane]] within the [[Maelstrom]] near the border with the [[Abyss]]. He has not returned there since his defeat, and Sydrixus is no longer accessible to his servants; it is unknown if this place still exists anymore.


## Appearance

> Ydersius takes the form of a giant, muscled serpentfolk with an impossibly long tail, [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]]-hard scales, and [[Iron|iron]]-like fangs. Ydersius is famous for his threefold [[Poison|poison]]: fang venom, toxic blood, and a cloud of poison exuded from his body. Statues often depict him standing on a pedestal made from the coils of his tail, and wearing an elaborate crown or headdress, although his clothing is simple.
> Ydersius' headless body now mindlessly rampages through the depths of [[Orv]], while his skull still lies in the cooled lava lake near Ilmurea where Savith disposed of it, luring serpentfolk to that region and sending them visions and thoughts. Having been divided in two for so long, Ydersius is scarcely conscious or aware of his own followers, and his communions with them are confusing and often conflicting.


### Avatar of Ydersius

> Ydersius' avatar resembles the full [[Deity|god]]: it is a huge snake-headed humanoid with a massively long tail.


## Relationships

> Since his fall, no gods have had relationships with Ydersius. Prior to his fall, the pantheon of Azlant led by [[Abadar]], [[Desna]], and [[Shelyn]] stood together against the Father of Serpents, and it is extremely likely that these three gods would re-engage their battle against a resurgent Ydersius. He has also long been opposed to [[Yig]], who has turned his attentions elsewhere after Savith defeated Ydersius.
> Another enemy of Ydersius was the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Abraxas]] whose portfolio includes snakes. This initiated a clash of power over the serpentfolk population dear to Ydersius. Some serpentfolk still worship Abraxas, and the cult of Ydersius does not tolerate such heresy.


## Servants

> All of the god's servants are ophidian. Ydersius' [[Herald|herald]] is known as the [[Emperor of Scales]].
> Three other servants are commonly known within the cult:

> - Azal-tash, a fiendish [[Couatl|couatl]]
> - Jitajaya, a [[Spirit naga|spirit naga]]
> - Lixiriltha, a [[Marilith|marilith]] [[Demon|demon]]

## Church of Ydersius

> Ydersius is the patron deity of the serpentfolk, who are his still-active [[Mortal|mortal]] kin. An organization exists known as the [[Coils of Ydersius]] that is dedicated to bringing about his triumphant return. At the height of their empire, the serpentfolk venerated Ydersius as the paragon of their species and embodiment of their eternal empire. Since his defeat, the degenerate serpentfolk have worshipped him as their progenitor and a god of war and poison; while the few remaining advanced serpentfolk see him as the one who would revive the old serpentfolk empire.
> In addition to serpentfolk, Ydersius is also worshipped by a few [[Iruxi|iruxis]], [[Boggard|boggards]], and [[Xulgath|xulgaths]] as a god who will bring their species back to their old glories. He is also venerated by some [[Naga|nagas]] and [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]] as a god of snakes, by [[Human|human]] snake cults as a god of [[Immortality|immortality]], and by fringe assassin groups as a god of poison and murder.


### Unholy Texts

> Many unholy texts of Ydersius were lost when the serpentfolk empire fell, including the *Alberos Analects*. Today, only the *Sekamina Destinies* are used by cults.


### Holidays

> The faithful of Ydersius once celebrated many holidays, but today only one date has much significance: the Day of Sundering on 29 [[Rova]].


### Artifacts

> The *[[Skull of Ydersius]]*, a powerful [[Artifact|artifact]], can be attached to his headless body to allow him to return to full power. Destroying it would permanently kill Ydersius, but this is an almost impossible task. For instance, one method requires Ydersius' manifestation to be dragged to the [[Boneyard]] and slain in the presence of [[Pharasma]] for her immediate judgment, which would cause him to disintegrate.
