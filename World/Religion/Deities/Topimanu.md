> **Topimanu** is a [[Mace|mace]]-wielding [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Monkey|monkey]] [[Deity|god]] known for his loyalty. The center of his worship is the [[Janvari]] [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapada]] in the [[Crying Jungle]], where the [[Jansagar Lake]] lies, protected by the surrounding mahajanapadas at the behest of the goddess [[Janpati]], who dwells in the lake's depths. Rumours abound that [[Animal|animals]] that drink from the lake's waters gain sapience and thousands of sapient animals do actually populate the Janvari mahajanapada. There, they are ruled by [[Tendula]], a [[Panther|panther]] [[Rajah|rajah]].
