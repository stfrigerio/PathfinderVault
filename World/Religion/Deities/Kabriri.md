> The carrion-stenched [[Demon lord|demon lord]] **Kabriri** (pronounced ka-BREE-ree) is the patron of [[Golarion|Golarions]] flesh-hungry, [[Cannibal|cannibalistic]] [[Ghoul|ghouls]].



## History

> One myth is that Kabriri was the first [[Mortal|mortal]] to eat the flesh of his kind. He died soon thereafter from a stomach complaint, to be reborn in the [[Abyss]] as the first ghoul. Some claim that in life, Kabriri was an [[Elf|elf]], and that this is why ghouls have long ears and slender bodies, and also why elves are immune to their paralysis.


## Home

> Kabriri dwells in the [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Everglut]], a cyclopean necropolis which is said to have spontaneously created itself in welcome for the first human [[Soul|soul]] to have committed cannibalism. Lit by strange green light, the libraries of Everglut are unusually vast. It is said that going deep past ranked shelves and certain blocked doors can lead to similar libraries hidden deep under [[Leng]].


## Appearance

> Kabriri resembles the ghouls that so fervently worship his flesh-eating doctrine. Kabriri's flesh is pallid with the cold, waxy texture of dead skin; his frame is well-muscled yet emaciated as if he had been starved for countless years; his mouth boasts teeth far sharper than a humans, designed to rend flesh. Kabriri's hands are far more talon-like than that of the average ghoul's; his feet are also different, being cloven hooves rather than human feet. This latter aspect he shares with the more powerful [[Ghul|ghuls]] who sometime serve as his high priests. His signature [[Weapon|weapon]] is a two-headed [[Flail|flail]] made of [[Iron|iron]] and bone capable of rotting flesh and creating ghouls by touch. His [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a maggot-filled bowl made from a [[Human|human]] skull.


## Worshipers & cults

> Kabriri is predominantly worshiped by the cannibalistic ghouls that dwell in the hidden warrens beneath the Golarion's surface, especially the more civilized specimens who dwell in the [[Darklands]] city of [[Nemret-Noktoria]] deep beneath [[Osirion]]. Nemret-Noktoria has strong connections with [[Undead|undead]] nation of [[Geb's Rest]] which also harbours a ghoul population dedicated to He Who Gnaws. Some of his followers enacted bloody rituals in his honour beneath the gibbous [[Moon|moon]], dancing and feasting beneath the night sky. His followers tend to wear black and purple robes, and use the foul carrion perfume of Kabriri.
> [[Leng ghoul|Leng ghouls]] are a notable exception to Kabriri's worship: they predominantly worship [[Nyarlathotep]] instead and view Kabriri as a false patron. Kabriri teaches that the ghouls of Leng turned their back on him, but the ghouls cite compelling evidence that they are far older than Kabriri himself. They see the antics of Kabriri's followers as the stumblings of children discovering a lifestyle they have lived for eons.
