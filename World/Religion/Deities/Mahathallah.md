> **Mahathallah** is a [[Queen of the Night]], one of the female powers who followed [[Asmodeus]] into [[Hell]] eons ago during the Exodus. She was once a [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp usher]]: a handmaiden of the [[God|goddess]] [[Pharasma]], who was granted the double-edged vision of her own death. She fled Pharasma's side in terrible fear, wishing to avoid her fate. Her [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a single eye surrounded by mystic [[Rune|runes]] and a two-toned haze.



## History

> As a psychopomp usher, Mahathallah was obsessed by how she was capable of seeing the ends of [[Mortality|mortals]] but not her own end. She beseeched Pharasma, but her goddess said that only those who travel the [[River of Souls]] may learn their final fate.
> Mahathallah left the [[Boneyard]] and went to the [[Material Plane]], where she located the last being to die and followed that [[Soul|soul]] along the River of Souls. Mahathallah took a particularly winding route along the River of Souls: by the end, all her shrines were rubble. As Mahathallah stood once more before Pharasma, the goddess revealed her final moment to her. Mahathallah, having not understood the fear of death of mortals and terrified by the sight of her end, fled.
> Mahathallah's wanderings took her to [[Xibalba]], whose [[Sahkil|sahkils]] recall her passing with furious awe and proud scars, and the Material Plane, where she spoiled the destiny of [[Planet|planets]]. Her final destination was Hell: Asmodeus calmed her, and Mahathallah became a servant of Hell.


## Appearance

> Mahathallah begins each morning in her original [[Angel|angelic]] form, but deteriorates during the day, until she is nothing but a skeleton at evening time. To disguise this transformation, she covers herself with numerous [[Illusion|illusions]], wishing not to be reminded of the fate that supposedly awaits her.


## Realm

***Main article: [[Voiporl]]***
> Mahathallah rules over Voiporl, a desert of violet sand located between the infernal layers of [[Phlegethon]] and [[Stygia]] and contained entirely within a vast system of caverns. The deserts of Voiporl are home to giant [[Serpent|serpents]] and dragonflies, in addition to [[Witch|witches]], [[Medusa|medusas]], and [[Undead|undead]] who come there in search of wisdom.


## Providence

> Mahathallah's favour takes the form of lucid dreams, euphoric visions, fires hissing like soft laughter, and temporary youthfulness. Her disapproval results in wicks that do not burn, skin wrinkles, ineffective drugs, and blindness.


## Followers

> Mahathallah's followers meditate on [[Metaphysical|metaphysical]] subjects and consider themselves above others in the [[Multiverse|multiverse]]. They use a perception-altering [[Drug|drug]] called adyton to commune with Mahathallah in her [[Mindscape|mindscape]], called the Adyton after the drug; followers of great faith can harness their control over their body's blood and [[Toxin|toxins]].
> Her faithful have no clergy, congregations, monuments, or ceremonies, finding all such practices to be wasteful distractions. Their only pursuits are of fate-changing knowledge and powers through [[Psychic magic|psychic]] journeys and closely held secrets. At other times, they tend to gardens, tell fortunes, and counsel others.


### Holidays

> Followers of Mahathallah mark [[Astronomy|astronomical]] events as holidays, and celebrate the [[Absalom Reckoning]] calendar's leap day as **Fateless Day**—a day that they claim stops the [[River of Souls]] flow and opens a secret path in the afterlife that bypasses Pharasma's judgment.


### Unholy texts

> While Mahathallah does not have a universal [[Unholy|unholy]] text, her followers share a vast repository of knowledge in the Adyton and contribute to it in journals known as "mysteries". Her most faithful followers spend much of their time there to study or teach distant visitors.
> *The Mysteries of Salaur*, a popular mystery of Mahathallah in [[Qadira]], documents several hallucinogenic drugs and rites to Mahathallah, including an encoded formula for adyton. Its [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]] author, Salaur, is said to have entered a perpetual state of near-death in order to explore the realm of Adyton.


## Relationships

> Mahathallah has close ties to the other Queens of the Night: they mistrust each other, but will reluctantly side with each other against other [[Devil|devils]]. Mahathallah trades her mysteries of nature and the cosmos for [[Doloras]] [[Science|science]] and suffering in a distant, but mutually beneficial, relationship; while [[Eiseth]] considers Mahathallah too slow and patient. Regardless, cults of all Queens of the Night consider each other allies.
> Mahathallah is loyal to Asmodeus; it is claimed that without his protection, she would have been destroyed long ago. Mahathallah shares her interest in dark secrets with [[Barbatos]] and [[Geryon]], and also shares prophecies with Barbatos.
> Among the sahkils, the [[Sahkil tormentor|sahkil tormentor]] Eil admits to owing Mahathallah numerous favours; Beiltod Goremouth holds a grudge against her; and the mysterious Agra acknowledges Mahathallah as her mother. Pharasma seems not to care about Mahathallah's betrayal, while the followers of [[Desna]], [[Andoletta]], and [[Immonhiel]] view Mahathallah's cult as hoarders of truth and corrupters of secrets.


## Soul anchors

***Main article: Soul anchor***
> Mahathallah's worshipers can corrupt the River of Souls to create *soul anchors*, which are items that preserve [[Mortal|mortal]] memories in the afterlife.


> [[Paizo]] published a major article about Mahathallah in *[[Dance of the Damned]]*, p70–75.
