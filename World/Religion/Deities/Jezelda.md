> **Jezelda** (pronounced jeh-ZEL-dah) is the shape-shifting [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of [[Werewolves|werewolves]] and mistress of the [[Moon|moon]].



## Appearance

> Jezelda, like the werewolf, can assume three forms.  The first is a [[Human|human]] form, that of a beautiful, pale [[Varisian]] women with long, flowing ebony hair. The second is that of an enormous, slavering [[Wolf|wolf]] with huge fangs dripping saliva and horrible yellow eyes. Jezelda's third and favourite form is a horrible hybrid of the two, half wolf and half woman; in this form she looks starved and skinny, hungry for fresh meat.


## History

> Jezelda plays an important role in the history of [[Golarion]], because she is believed by many to be the first [[Lycanthrope|lycanthrope]] who spread the disease to all who now suffer from it. If this is true, then she has placed a huge blight upon the people of the world, but strangely her cultists do not boast of this, instead staying ominously silent on the rumours of their patroness' origins.
> A century ago, a lycanthropic cult of Jezelda turned the Remembrance Moon festival, originally celebrated in [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] and [[Ustalav]] to honour the fallen in the crusade against the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]], into a night of stalking and hunting a target chosen by the cult for the year before. Knowledge of this tradition was exposed when the cult chose to target a [[Paladin|paladin]] who ended up defeating the werewolves and leading a crusade that wiped out the cult.


## Home

> Jezelda dwells in the [[Abyssal realm]] known as the [[Moonbog]], a terrifying land of moors and bogs under a constant, ever-present [[Moon Moonbog|moon]]. Jezelda's minions stock the Moonbog with humanoid inhabitants from throughout the [[Material Plane]] for their mistress, [[Lycanthrope|lycanthropes]], and her [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Antipaladin|antipaladins]] to hunt.


## Cult and worshipers

> Jezelda is worshiped almost exclusively by werewolves, for she sees all other [[Humanoid|humanoids]] as just prey, although occasionally lunatics or deranged rural folk prey to her as well. Her worship is most prevalent in areas with large werewolf populations, in particular the [[Darkmoon Vale]] in northern [[Andoran]] and the haunted forests of [[Ustalav]], particular the county of [[Lozeri]]. Within the dark [[Shudderwood]] in Ustalav, there is a tribe of werewolves who worship Jezelda called the Jezeldans.
> Her followers do not build temples to the demon lord, preferring to worship her in forest glades, remote farmhouses, or among ancient standing stones. They conduct their rituals at nighttime, offering up their prayers to the moon. On nights when there is a new moon, Jezeldans sacrifice intelligent creatures (preferably of their own race or parent race), tearing out their throats with the claws and teeth and feasting upon their still-convulsing bodies.
> Non-werewolf lycanthropes are despised by Jezelda and her cultists are charged with hunting and killing them. Lycanthropes with more benevolent outlooks are considered an abomination by Jezeldans, and are therefore a particularly favoured sacrifice.
