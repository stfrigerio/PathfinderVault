> **Tsathoggua** is the [[Great Old One]] of [[Magic|magic]], outcasts, and the underworld. Despite his [[Evil|evil]] nature, he can sometimes be jovial or friendly toward supplicants, but Tsathoggua is unpredictable and likely to eat those he had been aiding only moments ago as he tires of their company.



## Home

> Tsathoggua dwells in a vast cavern network. Some say that he rules over blue-lit K'n-Yan, while others maintain that he was driven by K'n-Yan's residents down to dark N'kai, where light dares not go.


## Appearance

> Tsathoggua resembles a bloated, furred [[Toad|toad]]-like [[Humanoid|humanoid]] with a [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bat]] face, sleepy eyes, and a toothy grin.


## Servants

> Tsathoggua was the creator of the original [[Formless spawn|formless spawn]], and most of them still serve him, giving rise to their longer name: *formless spawn of Tsathoggua*. Formless spawn who become [[Cleric|clerics]] of Tsathoggua can use their own bodies in place of an [[Holy symbol|unholy symbol]] to cast [[Spell|spells]].


## Cults

> Tsathoggua is most often worshipped as a [[Deity|god]] of magic. Most of his followers are lone outcasts and rarely gather in groups or work together; however, the presence of well-preserved temples on numerous [[Planet|planets]] suggest that this might have not been always the case. Such temples are now only inhabited by monsters, Tsathoggua's spawn, or a small group of (or just one single) [[Cleric|clerics]].
