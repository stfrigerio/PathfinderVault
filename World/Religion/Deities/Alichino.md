> **Alichino** is the [[Malebranche|malebranche]] responsible for preparing for the conquest of [[Golarion]] by [[Hell]]. He is known as the "Jester Prince of the Cage" and is a master of disguise as well as a trickster who seeks to befriend anyone with power by using a dozen voices and a hundred different faces.



## History

> According to ancient legend, the [[Devil|devil]] Alichino tasked the legendary hero [[Strada]] with the conquest of an invincible city. Strada sought the help of an oracle of [[Gorum]] and was given the thousand fangs of the [[Dragon|dragon]] [[Kathalphas]]. When Strada sowed the teeth into the ground outside the city as instructed, all the heroes the dragon had devoured sprang up into battle. Having frustrated the devil, Strada ruled the city for 90 years with the skeletal army as guard. [[Magic|Magical]] [[Spartoi seeds|spartoi seeds]] that temporarily [[Summon|summon]] the skeletal [[Undead|undead]] warriors known as [[Spartolos|spartoloi]] have been created since in memory of this legend.


## Worshippers

> The Harlequin Society, a masked congregation of the elite in the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] city of [[Karcau]], whose members meet to indulge in forbidden debaucheries, is secretly a cult of Alichino.
