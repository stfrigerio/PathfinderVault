> **Bokrug**, also referred to as the **Water Lizard**, is the [[Great Old One]] of revenge, storms, and water. A relatively benign Great Old One, Bokrug prefers to enjoy being worshipped and has little desire to destroy others, except when he is angered or needs to avenge himself or his worshippers.



## Appearance

> Bokrug resembles an immense, spiny, sickly green iguana whose exceptionally long tail ends in three spines.


## Home

> Bokrug slumbers under a nameless lake, to and from which no waterway flows, in the remote land of Mnar in the [[Dreamlands]]. However, the water in the lake is not stagnant, suggesting that they connect underground to the lakes and rivers of the Dreamlands.


## Cults

> Bokrug's original worshippers were a hideous race of amphibians known only as [[Being of Ib|beings of Ib]]. They built the city of Ib on the shore of the lake where Bokrug dwells, and lived there for ages until being slaughtered by the [[Human|humans]] from the city of [[Sarnath]]. One thousand years later, their shades rose from the lake, descended upon and brought doom to Sarnath, exterminated its inhabitants, and wiped the metropolis from existence. Now, in isolated regions of dream, the Water Lizard is appeased through sacrifice.
> Dreamers who encounter Bokrug's cult in the Dimension of Dreams will often carry the seeds of the faith into the waking world. In this way, the Great Old One's cult can be found in many rural regions, bringing blessings of wealth and fine weather in exchange for blood sacrifices. Although the Water Lizard does not seem to care if its offerings are sentient, many cults have taken to sacrificing criminals, captives, and other unwanted [[Humanoid|humanoids]].
> In addition to humans, Bokrug is also worshipped by various swamp-dwelling races, especially those that suffered at the hands of intruders. Very few [[Good|good]] followers of Bokrug exist: they try to keep him calmly slumbering, and are considered heretics by his traditional devotees.
> Great shrines to Bokrug usually feature realistic statues of Bokrug's form. According to cultists, their patron can see through and animate from such statues.


### Holy symbol

> Bokrug's [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] is a green [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Lizard|lizard]] with a long, coiling tail.
