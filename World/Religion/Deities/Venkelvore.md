> Obese **Venkelvore** is the consort of [[Hadregash]], and one of two female [[Goblin|goblin]] deities among the group of demigod [[Barghest|barghests]] (collectively known as the four [[Goblin hero-gods|goblin hero-gods]]). Despite her obsessive desire for feeding, she is considered the most attractive demigod among the goblinoids. The goddess' hunger can only be satisfied by the ingestion of sentient beings.



## Relations

> Venkelvore's insatiable hunger causes her to steal food from the other Hero-Gods, much to their annoyance. Even Venkelvore's followers occasionally bear misfortune wrought by her unquenchable hunger.


## Home

> All goblin hero-gods are resident in [[Basalfeyst]] in the [[Abyss]].


## Unholy symbol

> Venkelvore's unholy symbol is a half-eaten piece of food (traditionally a piece of cheese, meat, or a pickle).
