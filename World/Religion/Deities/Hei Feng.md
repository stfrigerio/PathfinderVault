> The [[Tian Xia]] [[Deity|god]] **Hei Feng's** domain is the sea and the sky, whether it brings good fortune or ill. His [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] is a lightning bolt arcing out of a dark storm cloud. He is the patron deity of [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]] and is worshiped in many lands. He often appears as a powerful tengu swordsman with a nine-ring broadsword and is accompanied by divine servants known as the counts of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning.
> A group of tengu Hei Fengan priests known as the [[Sunderstorm Covenant]] were key contributors to the establishment of the tengu nation of [[Kwanlai]], though their creed of overwhelming response to any slight has caused their faith to lose influence.
