> **Dretha**, the **Dark Mother**, is the [[Orc]] [[Deity|goddess]] of fertility, birth, and death. She presides over orc domestic life and watches over female orcs carrying, birthing, and rearing children, as she believes in strength in numbers and strong warriors. She blesses those who fight to protect their family, lands, or possessions from enemies. Dretha is subservient to the other gods of the orc pantheon due to her gender, and is generally depicted as very sullen and filled with hidden rage.



## Appearance

> Dretha is depicted as a pregnant orc, with a swollen belly, large breasts, and small limbs and head.


## Relationships

> Orcs usually claim Dretha to be the mate of their tribe's preferred male god. She is said to be an ancient enemy of [[Lamashtu]], and her followers rarely venerate the Mother of Monsters.


## Cults

> Dretha is the most commonly worshipped orc god: orc tribes might favour different male gods but all acknowledge her and ask for her aid in defence or procreation. Most of her followers are orc women, who sometimes offer sacrifices to Dretha to ensure that they survive childbirth and that their children are strong.
