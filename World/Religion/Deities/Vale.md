> **Vale** is an agender [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp usher]] who serves as chief prosecutor and authority on non-[[Deity|deific]] religions in the [[Boneyard]]. The Court of Ancestors advocates for the judgement of [[Soul|souls]] based on external impact, disregarding internal intentions.


## History

> Vale washed ashore in the Boneyard in the earliest days of [[Mortality|mortal life]], borne on the [[River of Souls]] by the collective weight and influence of cultures upon individuals.


## Appearance

> Vale resembles the fusion of several naked, androgynous figures, crowned with a white, circular crystal.
