> **Ssila'meshnik, the Colourless Lord** is the gender-fluid [[Protean lord|protean lord]] of fate, freedom, and paradox, and the most prominent protean lord.



## Home

> Ssila'meshnik has no known divine realm in the [[Maelstrom]], but has been called the 'Warden of [[Galisemni]]'. The connection between Ssila'meshnik and the Watching Seven, the seven towering [[Keketar|keketar]] statues in Galisemni, is unknown. Nevertheless, Ssila'meshnik's largest temple and centre of worship is located in Galisemni, an iridescent crystalline building where [[Time|time]] and [[Magic|magic]] are unstable.


## Appearance

> Ssila'meshnik appears as an albino keketar [[Protean|protean]] or a [[Ganzi|ganzi]] with an intertwined trio of crowns. Their form is shadowed by after-images and periodically breaks into superimposed possibilities as they manipulate reality and choose the best course of action.


## Relationships

> Ssila'meshnik is permitted by [[Pharasma]] to arrive in the [[Boneyard]] without warning to arbitrate certain cases. The [[Soul|souls]] being judged lived contradictory, mercurial lives, with the only constant being their insistence on absolute freedom. Ssila'meshnik displays courteous respect but no humility in Pharasma's presence.
> Ssila'meshnik distrusts [[Asmodeus]], and has a violent history with the [[Axiomite|axiomites]].
