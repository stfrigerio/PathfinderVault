> **Myr** is a [[Deity|goddess]] of perfection and respect for one's ancestors worshiped by the inhabitants of ancient [[Azlant]]. She teaches that the body and life should be cherished by those who wish to achieve amazing accomplishments, and that those with the means and resources should aid the less fortunate.


## Relationships

> Myr is passionately in love with [[Elion]], but he is constantly away from home due to his need to explore. Although Myr misses him when Elion is on such journeys, she is also thankful for the more stable household that results from his absence. They have a daughter named [[Sicva]], but she became a terrible child and despises her mother for her charity. Elion and Myr's shared guilt over Sicva's corruption has strained their relationship.


## Church of Myr

> The [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] worshipped Myr for her dedication to charity, and prayed to her for the health of their bloodline. As the aristocracy grew in importance, people flocked to Myr's temples, hoping to track their lineage to an ancient Azlanti hero. Toward the end of the empire, athletes and warriors turned to worship Myr in their desire to improve their health.
