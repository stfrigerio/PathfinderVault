> **Dalenydra**, also called **the Blessed Attendant**, is an [[Angel|angel]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] concerned with battlefield healing and patron of those who undertake this work and have sworn an oath of non-violence.


## Followers

> The Blessed Attendant's workers wear a special red-and-white tabard that identifies them even in melee; their code allows them to defend themselves but must not attack. Their oath is honoured by many and even enemy soldiers are known to have refused to strike a servant of Dalenydra on the battlefield.
> To avoid the death and wounding they attend on the battlefield, Dalenydra's followers preach pacifism, highlighting the suffering that war causes in the full knowledge that their warnings are usually ignored by any set against their enemy. Dalenydra is served by many turtle-like [[Chelonidal|chelonidal]] [[Agathion|agathions]], who act as guardians and use their damage-resistant shells to help protect the defenceless.
