> **Elion** is a [[Deity|deity]] of exploration and discovery worshiped by the [[Human|humans]] of [[Azlant|ancient Azlant]]. He teaches his followers to explore and find the best that creation provides, and is credited with the creation of the first *[[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Wayfinder|wayfinder]]*.



## History

> Elion was worshipped by the early [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]], and he taught them how to read the signs of nature, to travel through the wilderness, and reach the great lands beyond the seas surrounding their home. It is said that after [[Earthfall]], he lost interest in [[Golarion]] and ventured out to the edge of the [[Great Beyond]]; his faith is unknown on Golarion today.


## Relationships

> Elion is passionately in love with [[Myr]], but he is constantly away from home due to his need to explore. Although Myr misses him when Elion is on such journeys, she is also thankful for the more stable household that results from his absence. They have a daughter named [[Sicva]], but she ended up a terrible child and despises her father for his capriciousness, and Elion and Myr's shared guilt over Sicva's corruption has strained their relationship.
> Elion is an ally of [[Desna]] and their followers often travelled together, but Elion's often found Desna's too flighty and unfocused to make significant discoveries. However, their bond deepened as Elion's church became interested in [[Space travel|space travel]].
> As Elion's priests found habitable lands, they would be followed by those of [[Abadar]] who would establish colonies. Their relationship was somewhat strained by how Elion's priests disapproved of the sometimes harsh methods that the Abadarans used.


## Church of Elion


### Worshipers and clergy

> Thousands of Elion's forward priests sought out new places to explore and bring new information back home. They sought locations no one else had previously visited, and were the first Azlanti to sail across the [[Arcadian Ocean]] to [[Avistan]], [[Garund]], and [[Arcadia]]. It is believed that a priest of Elion was the first advocate of exploring and colonising the rest of the [[Solar system|solar system]], and that after Earthfall, Elion's followers were instrumental in the exodus out of Azlant into other continents.
