> **Trudd** is a [[Deity|deity]] almost entirely worshiped by [[Dwarf|dwarves]]. He is the youngest son of the primary dwarven deity, [[Torag]]. Despite his relatively young age, Trudd is the strongest deity in the dwarven pantheon, and as a result is often left to guard his father's halls while Torag is absent. For a dwarf, Trudd sports a remarkably short beard, spawning many tales, including one that he sold it for some unknown boon.

### Chelonidal agathions

> Despite the general dwarven aversion to the sea, [[Chelonidal|chelonidal]] [[Agathion|agathions]] share many other interests in common especially around military matters. This closeness and respect is demonstrated by Trudd's favouring of chelonidal legions to aid him and his interests.
