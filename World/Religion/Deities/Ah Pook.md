> **Ah Pook** is an [[Evil|evil]] [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] [[Deity|deity]] who preys upon fears, twisting [[Mortality|mortals]] doubts until they break, ruining their lives and those of their associates, and revelling in their misery. He is known under several names across Arcadia: those in [[Xopatl]] and [[Innazpa]] call him **Ohachtsik**.



## Relationships

> Ah Pook is opposed by [[Kazutal]].


## Appearance and emissaries

> Ah Pook is served by many [[Sahkil|sahkils]] who see an opportunity in furthering mortals' fears. For as long as mortals have existed, Ah Pook's sahkil servants have collected [[Soul|souls]] for him and left them in the bowels of Xibalba. Most of the time, Ah Pook leaves them alone to torture each other; when visiting them, he remains silent to add to their dread.
> In [[-1505 AR]], when Imictal called for Ah Pook's aid, he gathered the souls of his forces and added them to his collection, from which he created the Army of Fire, and also turned the ashes of Imictal's men into a beast named [[Cuetzmonquali]]. Even after Imictal was defeated, both the Army of Fire and Cuetzmonquali have endured; when the *Spear of the Destroyer's Flame* is collected by another mortal, Ah Pook rebuilds the Army of Fire, which he sees as a suitable torture for the souls he collected.
