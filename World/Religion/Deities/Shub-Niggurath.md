> **Shub-Niggurath** is an [[Outer God]] belonging to a group of immensely powerful, yet inscrutable beings called the [[Elder Mythos]], or the gods of the [[Dark Tapestry]]. Shub-Niggurath is the fertility [[Deity|deity]] of that pantheon. Her [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] consists of three [[Goat|goat]] heads attached at the neck, with horns pointed outward to form a circular shape.



## Home

> Shub-Niggurath resides in what is known as the Dark Tapestry: the darkness between the stars where inhabitants of [[Golarion]] believe true [[Madness|madness]] lies.
> Shub-Niggurath's mobility means she is able to materialize quite readily on any [[Planet|planet]] in the [[Material Plane]] especially if locals are dabbling with her spawn.


## Appearance

> Shub-Niggurath appears as an alien, sanity-shaking, immense blob of living tissue and mist with tentacles, hooves, eyes, fanged mouths and other deformities protruding from every surface.


## Relationships

> Shub-Niggurath is a fecund [[Deity|goddess]] and has mated with probably most Dark Tapestry deities, giving birth to powerful offspring. The goddess' title refers to the number of spawn she is likely to have born. Some of her most successful spawn are termed [[Dark young of Shub-Niggurath|dark young of Shub-Niggurath]], which start out as [[Moit of Shub-Niggurath|moit of Shub-Niggurath]].


## On Golarion

> The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young has a relatively strong following within the [[Inner Sea region]] compared to the other gods of her pantheon, usually localized in rural areas: especially forests, jungles or swamps. The largest cult following is around [[Lake Encarthan]], which is also home to a piece of Shub-Niggurath: the [[Watcher in the Bay]], the result of an [[Occult ritual|occult ritual]] designed to call out Shub-Niggurath enacted long ago by her worshipper [[Ariadnah]].
> Shub-Niggurath was responsible for spawning millions of [[Neothelid|neothelids]] into the surface of Golarion during the [[Age of Creation]]. Most neothelids venerate her and pray for her return so she might give birth to a new clutch of neothelids.
> Outside of Golarion, the [[Mi-go|mi-go]] population mostly worship Shub-Niggurath.
