> **Ragadahn the Water Lord** is one of the [[Eldest]], a divine [[Fey|fey]] creature of tremendous power said to be able to reshape the very fabric of the [[First World]] on a whim. He appears as a [[Linnorm|linnorm]] and maintains that he is the father of all linnorms in the First World and, one suspects, the [[Material Plane]] too. In making this claim, he also counts himself the Father of Dragons and this title may be considered heretical by other [[Dragon|dragon]] [[Deities|deities]]. Arrogant and wise at the same time, Ragadahn believes that the oceans are home to the first life and the secrets of eternity, and knows a great deal about extinct aquatic cultures in the [[Great Beyond]]. He is fond of symbolism, especially the limitless [[Ouroboros|ouroboros]] and spiral.



## Appearance

> Ragadahn is an enormous, streamlined blue-green linnorm with flippers in place of legs.


## Home

> Ragadahn resides in the city of [[Karaphas]], but claims all bodies of water in the First World (and the Material Plane, to an extent) as his own realm and all creatures dwelling there as his subjects. In truth, he cares little about them, and few ever see him, though few dragons would enter the deep waters of the First World without his permission, and those seeking to speak to Ragadahn are advised to call his name from land so he would not accuse them of trespassing.
> Ragadahn is the Eldest that most often leaves the First World to travel and sire children in the Material Plane, or visit the libraries in [[Axis]].


## Relationships

> Ragadahn is intrigued by [[Magdh]], and shares an interest in the esoteric with [[Shyka]] and [[Ng]]. He considers the [[Green Mother]] petty, the [[Lantern King]] irreverent, and the [[Lost Prince]] pouty. It is believed that Ragadahn is the individual most knowledgeable about [[Imbrex|Imbrexs]] goals (outside of Imbrex themselves), but he rarely talks about the Twins.


## Followers

> Many linnorms bow before Ragadahn as their progenitor, while [[Chromatic dragon|chromatic]] and [[Metallic dragon|metallic dragons]] view his claimed title 'Father of Dragons' as heretical. The [[Lake Lost to the Sun]] in the [[Sarkoris Scar]] hosts a large population of fey [[Water orm|water orms]] led by a particularly huge [[Fjord linnorm|fjord linnorm]] called [[Ilirjastehr]], who serves as Ragadahn's envoy within the lake.
