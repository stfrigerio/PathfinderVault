> **Anubis** is the [[Deity|god]] of mummification and the guardian of tombs in the [[Osirian pantheon]]. He protects tombs and the [[Soul|souls]] of the dead on their way to receiving [[Pharasma|Pharasmas]] judgement in the [[Boneyard]].



## Dogma

> Anubis teaches that the dead deserve proper burial and that his faithful should be impartial when sitting in judgement. He sees [[Undead|undead]] as a descecration of the dead and urges his followers to destroy them. He also forbids the looting of tombs or the trapping of a [[Soul|soul]] to keep it from reaching its eternal destination.


## Appearance

> Anubis appears either as a [[Jackal|jackal]] or a jackal-headed, black-skinned [[Human|human]].


## Relationships

> Anubis is the son of [[Osiris]] and [[Nephthys]] born out of wedlock. He assisted [[Isis]] in the mummification of his father. He frequently works with Isis, [[Neith]], Nephthys, and [[Selket]] in the protection of the dead, and is an enemy of [[Set]] due to his association with undead.


## Church of Anubis

> Nearly all [[Osirion|Osirian]] tombs contain images or other depictions of Anubis. The patron of embalmers, his followers (including [[Paladin|paladins]]) usually wear jackal masks and are dedicated to the destruction of [[Undead|undead]].
