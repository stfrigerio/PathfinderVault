> **Menxyr** is a [[Demon lordNascent demon lord|nascent demon lord]] who controls an area of the [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Malvyrea]] known as the Harem Graves. He appears as an extremely emaciated creature, nearly 12 feet in height, but with tremendous strength. He has disgusting power to yank bones from the living but perpetrates greater evil to the dead: animation and necrophilia.
> Menxyr's unholy symbol is a skull covered with a wedding veil.
