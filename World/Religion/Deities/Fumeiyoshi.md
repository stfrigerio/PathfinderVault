> **Fumeiyoshi** is a [[Tian Xia]] [[Deity|deity]] most often associated with the [[Undead|undead]] and graves, although he is also the patron deity of the evil [[Oni|oni]].



## Appearance

> Fumeiyoshi has many different forms but the one he most commonly takes is that of an almost skeletal [[Tian-Min]] [[Humanoid|humanoid]] with three glowing red eyes, a set of jagged tusks, and a set of twisted claws.


## History

> [[Shizuru]], the Empress of Heaven, and the moon [[Deity|god]] [[Tsukiyo]] are lovers; Tsukiyo is the Prince of the [[Moon]] and the brother of Fumeiyoshi. Aeons ago, Fumeiyoshi, who was then the god of night, grew jealous of his brother's loving relationship with Shizuru and, on one occasion, grew so angry he murdered Tsukiyo. Shizuru then successfully requested the aid of [[Qi Zhong]], the god of [[Medicine|medicine]], to resurrect her lover. She then recruited [[Yaezhing]], the punisher of the gods and the enforcer of divine justice, to punish Fumeiyoshi by banishing him to his brother's tomb and stripping him of his position. She stated Fumeiyoshi would forever envy his betters as the [[Undead|undead]] envy the living and, indeed, Fumeiyoshi is now styled the Lord of Envy and in his portfolio are dishonour, envy, graves, and the undead. In contrast, after his rebirth, Tsukiyo added spirits to his portfolio.


## Church of Fumeiyoshi

> Fumeiyoshi is considered the patron of undead and of the oni and both frequently worship him; he is also often worshipped by former [[Paladin|paladins]] or [[Samurai|samurai]] who have fallen from grace or been somehow dishonoured. Because of his patronage, Fumeiyoshi's worship is centred in the [[Forest of Spirits]], [[Minkai]], and the monstrous kingdoms of [[Chu Ye]] and [[Shenmen]] Cults dedicated to Fumeiyoshi are a particular problem in metropolitan [[Goka]] where they make the already free-wheeling city even more dangerous.


#### Unholy symbol, favoured weapon, and sacred animal

> The [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] of Fumeiyoshi is a red [[Demon|demonic]] face and his favoured [[Weapon|weapon]] is the naginata. As with all the pantheon of [[Tian Xia]], Fumeiyoshi is associated with a [[Sacred animal|sacred animal]]; in his case, he adopts the [[Wolf|wolf]].
