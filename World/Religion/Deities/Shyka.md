![[Shyka.jpg|right+hmed]] 



> **Shyka the Many** is one of the [[Eldest]], a divine [[Fey|fey]] creature of tremendous power said to be able to reshape the very fabric of the [[First World]] on a whim. Shyka is considered a title or a role, for many entities, both male and female, have borne this name over the ages. All have been [[Chronomancy|chronomancers]] with mastery over [[Time|time]]; time acts strangely within the First World, but Shyka seems able to manipulate it. Indeed, their many forms and personalities over time, past and future, may well sit within Shyka together, out of time, as they all speak with the same voice. All of Shyka's incarnations have seen both the beginning and the end of the [[Great Beyond]], yet they are strangely interested in small events, especially those related to the continuum of time, which they call *perceived causality*. Many of their worshippers believe that Shyka quickly shepherds existence toward the best possible version, and has prevented its destruction innumerous times.



## Home

> Shyka's mountaintop lair is called the House of Eternity. Like its master, it holds a single position in space but not time.


## Appearance

> Long ago, the original Shyka contacted all who would eventually bear the title and called a convocation. In a place beyond time, all of them agreed to share their reign in flickers, each experiencing a sample of eternity, instead of having one succeed each other in chronological order. In order to keep the fabric of time and causality intact, only one Shyka can be present at a time, but can change without warning: one incarnation could remain for days and then give way to multiple others during a single conversation. Different incarnations have slightly different personalities but share memories and have lived others' lives for so long that they see no point in keeping individuality.
> Shyka's incarnations take numerous forms, from ordinary-looking [[Human|humans]] to bizarre creatures like a woman with green skin and mandibles, or an entity made entirely of light. The majority of them are [[Humanoid|humanoid]], and wear blue and grey gowns and robes.


## Relationships

> Shyka remains on speaking terms with some [[Bythos|bythos]] [[Aeon|aeons]] and [[Time dragon|time dragons]] even though they have attacked Shyka over the ages for meddling in time. They are fond of aiding less powerful beings for future service. All other Eldest sometimes seek out Shyka's knowledge but are never comfortable in their presence, knowing that Shyka has seen the end of their reign.


## On Golarion

> Shyka gifted the [[Artifact|artifact]] now known as *[[Vesper's Rapier|Vespers Rapier]]* to Vesper, the [[Bard's End|bard]].
