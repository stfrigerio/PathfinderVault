> **Valmallos, the Answering Rite,** is a [[Primordial inevitable|primordial inevitable]] who understands all laws of [[Magic|magic]], and regulates its usage to ensure it is inaccessible to those who fail to put sufficient practice and training to wield it responsibly. Scholars believe the complex array of [[Spell component|spell components]] so prevalent in magic are at least partially Valmallos's responsibility.


## Appearance

> The Answering Rite appears as a mechanical [[Giant|giant]] with an exposed, glowing heart. His form is also surrounded by serpentine [[Scroll|scrolls]].


## Cults

> Valmallos typically approves of [[Wizard|wizards]], and he and his devotees are wary of those born with the ability to use magic to the point of prejudice. Other [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] are judged on a case-by-case basis, depending how responsibly they used their powers in the past.
> His followers are perfectionists in magical practices, and Valmallos views them more as students whom he can educate in ways to make magic more complicated and less inaccessible to the irresponsible. His priests often spend long spans of time teaching apprentices, and hunt them down at any hint of misconduct.
