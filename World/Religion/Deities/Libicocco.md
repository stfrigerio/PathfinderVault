> **Libicocco**, the Prideful Lady of Winds, is the former member of an ancient alliance between four [[Malebranche|malebranche]] [[Devil|devils]] dedicated to conquering entire [[Material Plane]] [[Planet|planets]] until she broke with her now-dead allies. She has no desire to conquer like many of her peers, instead setting her goals on utter destruction.
