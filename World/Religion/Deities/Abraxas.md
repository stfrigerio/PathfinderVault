> **Abraxas** (pronounced a-BRAHK-zuhs) (occasionally spelled "**Abraxus**") is the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of forbidden lore and [[Magic|magic]], and called the **Master of the Final Incantation**. He is said to know countless magical formulae, [[Spell|spells]], and secrets, including the [[Final Incantation]], a single word so powerful its speaking causes the annihilation of magic. He specializes in magic and lore associated with pain and devastation, and dwells in [[Diovengia]], capital city of his [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Pleroma]].



## History

> Abraxas is one of the oldest [[Demon|demons]] of the [[Abyss]], though he was never a [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]]—a primordial inhabitant of the Abyss. Abraxas has gathered dark [[Arcane|arcane]] secrets through countless ages. It is said that Abraxas watched as the [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]] called down the [[Meteor|meteor]] that was responsible for [[Earthfall]] on [[Golarion]] and began the [[Age of Darkness]], as well as countless other magics best left forgotten. It was through these methods that Abraxas gained knowledge of the Final Incantation, a single word that can completely unmake magic. Abraxas has used the Final Incantation sparingly in the past, as it unbinds many of his own powers, but he has employed it to destroy [[Minor artifact|minor artifacts]], permanently strip all magic from a creature, and remove knowledge of a particular spell from the records and minds of an entire [[Planet|planet]].


## Appearance

> Abraxas is utterly demonic in appearance: he possesses the head of a fanged, deformed [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird]] with a tooth-filled mouth and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Lizard|lizard-like]] crest behind his head. In place of his legs, Abraxas has a pair of writhing [[Viper|vipers]], each with its own head and [[Poison|venomous]] fangs. Abraxas's torso is [[Humanoid|humanoid]] with the exception of his viperous legs and demented head. His two arms end in large claws that wield a [[Flail|flail]] (Abraxas's favored weapon) and a [[Shield|shield]]. Some sources replace the flail with a [[Whip|whip]] that is forked like a serpent's tongue.  His whip is said to have the ability to steal thoughts or even prepared spells from those who are struck by it, transferring them to Abraxas for his use, while his shield can animate and attack his enemies.


## Relationships

> [[Serpentfolk]] traditionally worship their own god, [[Ydersius]], but since the latter [[Deity|gods]] fall, enmity exists between the god and the demon lord over whom serpentfolk should worship.


## Servants

> Abraxas is served on the [[Material Plane]] by [[Marilith|mariliths]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]] of all kind. The demon lord will sometimes even send the mysterious and feared [[Xacarba|xacarbas]] to aid his most devoted followers by speaking secrets best forgotten, or to guard his largest temples or libraries.


## Church of Abraxas

> Temples to the demon lord can most commonly be found in dark libraries, reliquaries, and vaults.


### Worshipers

> Abraxas is venerated by [[Evil|evil]] [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] and scholars seeking forbidden knowledge at any price, even the death of all those they love. They tolerate no rivals and are cruel masters. Abraxas is worshiped in the [[Darklands]] among the [[Drow|drow]], especially those of [[House Azrinae]] who have access to darkened vaults filled with forgotten secrets. On the surface, Abraxas' following is particularly strong in the [[Nex|Nexian]] capital of [[Quantium]], where his worshipers control a hidden library called [[Scrivenbough]] filled with rare books and [[Scroll|scrolls]], although small cults can be found in nearly all of the [[Inner Sea region|Inner Sea regions]] major cities.


### Obedience

> Certain dedicated worshipers of Abraxas perform daily [[Obedience|obediences]] in order to receive [[Unholy|unholy]] blessings known as a [[Boon|boons]] from their deity. The Master of the Final Incantation's faithful flagellate themselves with small whips or tree branches, speaking mystical words of power with each blow.
