> Of all the [[Rakshasa|rakshasas]] to ascend to [[Rakshasa immortal|immortality]], **Ravana** is the oldest and greatest. He is the most powerful of all the rakshasa race. He has four arms and a [[Tiger|tigers]] head with three extra faces. Rumour has it that Ravana knows the thoughts and intentions of all rakshasas at any given moment and can influence them as he wishes.
