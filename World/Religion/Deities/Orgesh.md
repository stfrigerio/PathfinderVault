> The [[Great Old One]] **Orgesh** is arguably the best known among the inscrutable and obscure [[Deity|deities]] of the [[Charda|charda]], who view it as an endlessly hungry being that requires constant sacrifices of food to placate.



## History

> Orgesh was the first among the charda that spawned from the [[Black blood|black blood]] in the [[Land of Black Blood]], a vault of [[Orv]], the deepest [[Darklands]] region. According to charda mythology, this dangerous substance is the blood of Orgesh's mother, spilled when their [[Deity|god]] ate his way out of her womb.


## Home

> Orgesh no longer lives in the Land of Black Blood, having long ago abandoned its children. Due to this neglect, while the charda remain unpredictable, they are no longer cruel or vengeful. Those who do not worship Orgesh believe that it went to the deepest, darkest trench of the [[Sightless Sea]], to take care of its other children.


## Appearance

> Orgesh is a vaguely [[Humanoid|humanoid]] figure with [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|canine]] legs, a hugely distended belly, and no facial features except an open maw filled with [[Shark|shark]] teeth. No one alive has seen it for millennia, but its statues are strangely resistant to damage.


## Cults

> Orgesh's followers view each other as the greatest threat. Some believe that when they eat a fellow worshipper, they can consume their prey's faith as well, and when only one remains, Orgesh will return to use this devotee to unleash a new race upon Orv, one that will relentlessly expand until it consumes everything.


## Relics

> There are a number of relics of Orgesh in the [[Land of Black Blood]]. The [[Faceless Idol of the Hungering God]] is considered by the charda to be a depiction of Orgesh. The ancient city of [[Orgeshta]], not far from the idol, also has numerous icons of the god.
