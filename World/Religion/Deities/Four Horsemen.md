![[Trelmarixian.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Trelmarixian the Black, Horseman of Famine.
> The **Four Horsemen**, the **archdaemons**, the **End Bringers** are powerful and unique [[Daemon|daemons]] having attained the power of [[Demigod|demigods]]: they rule [[Abaddon]], and have hordes of daemons in their service.



## Description

> Each of the Four Horsemen represents one of four ideals: war, disease, famine and death. The actual position of being a Horseman is a coveted title and is often fought for by the greatest members of daemonkind. Each Horseman has his own legion of servitor daemons known as **deacons** or **destroyers**.


## Current Horsemen

> Each Horseman also boasts his own realm uniquely suited to what they represent. The current Four Horsemen are [[Apollyon]], the horseman of pestilence, who rules [[Plaguemere]]; the horseman of death, [[Charon]], who rules the [[River Styx]]; [[Szuriel]], the horseman of war, who presides over the [[Cinder Furnace]]; and [[Trelmarixian]], the horseman of famine, who rules Wasting. A fifth Horseman, known in forbidden texts as the [[Oinodaemon]], is said to be superior even to the Four Horsemen in power and stature.  Most believe he either never existed, or was killed by the remaining Horsemen long ago.


## Apocalypse horses

***Main article: [[Apocalypse horse]]***
> Each horseman has an [[Apocalypse horse|apocalypse horse]] as its mount.


## History

> 'Horseman' is a title granted to a powerful daemon who ascends to this position. There have been other daemons in the past who have arisen to the title of Horseman, but they have been replaced for various reasons, including by their murder at the hands of [[Lamashtu]]. The Horsemen, however, were the first daemons to appear.
> An ancient Horseman is responsible for the genesis of the [[Demon|demons]]. [[Lamashtu]] learnt the daemon's secret 'art' of creating demons from the torture of a former Horseman of the Apocalypse, whom she had taken during her wars against Abaddon. She had managed to take two Horsemen captive during these wars and murdered both of them.


### Previous Horsemen

> Before the current incumbents, there have been a number of previous Horsemen such as the following:


#### Horsemen of Death

> Charon is the only Horseman of Death to exist holding this possession since the beginning.


#### Horsemen of Famine

> - Lyutheria the Parasite Queen, the original Horseman of Famine

#### Horsemen of Pestilence

> - Azulos the Corrupting, the original Horseman of Pestilence
> - Drulaema the Fever Princess
> - [[Llamolaek]], a Horseman of Pestilence demoted into an [[Astradaemon|astradaemon]] by his rival, Roshmolem. Now a [[Harbinger|harbinger]].
> - [[Yrsinius]]

#### Horsemen of War

> - Horeksim, the original Horseman of War
> - Roshmolem the Steel Weaver
> - Ortaro of the Ten Thousand Screams

#### Unspecified

> - Balishek, early Horseman of unknown station destroyed utterly at [[Balishek's Crater|Balisheks Crater]] in Abaddon.

## Churches of the Horsemen

> The Four Horsemen are such powerful fiends that they are capable of granting spells and power to their deluded, nihilistic [[Cleric|clerics]]. They do not have churches or organised faiths on the [[Material Plane]], but rather are worshipped out of fear or by hate-filled monsters.
