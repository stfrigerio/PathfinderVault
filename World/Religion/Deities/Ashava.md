> **Ashava the True Spark** is an [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azata]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] who manifested from marsh lights that danced in [[Elysium]] for ages, achieving [[Deity|divinity]] in doing so. Legends hold that Ashava seeks out lonely [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] who have become lost, leading them to safety at night. Graveyard shrines to Ashava reportedly give lost [[Soul|souls]] a place where they can rest.



## History

> Millennia-old legends speak that on a clear, [[Moon|moonlit]] night, the numerous whirling lights in the marshes and fens of Elysium coalesced into Ashava.
> Among the numerous tales of Ashava and her followers protecting the common folk from [[Will-o'-wisp|will-o-wisps]], one stands out above all others. Long ago, when a hunter became lost, he beseeched the [[Deity|gods]] but was only heard by two beings: Ashava and Lady Rushlight, who is said to be the first will-o'-wisp. Both attempted to shine and lead the hunter in opposite directions, but he only sat defeated on the corpse of the deer he killed. In his despair, he sang a tune that he often hummed with his wife; in response, Ashava began to dance while Lady Rushlight grew brighter to distract him. The hunter found Ashava's movements much friendlier than Lady Rushlight's glare and allowed her to lead him to safety. Lady Rushlight, having expended so much power, never glowed again and later starved to death.


## Home

> Ashava makes her home in the Sparkling Fens at the base of the Mountain of Lingering Soulsong, Elysium's grand peak. Those that approach it hear a lifting melody that accompanies Ashava and her servants in their dances. Travellers cannot get lost, as floating balls of light spontaneously appear to lead them to their destinations. These lights are both servants and extensions of Ashava, and she can control them from anywhere in the cosmos as parts of herself.


## Appearance

> Ashava is often depicted as a seven-foot-tall [[Varisian]] woman with long dark hair and flushed cheeks who glows faintly from within. Her gown made of [[Star|starlight]] causes Ashava to be partially obscured by shadows, except when under the light of a bright [[Moon|moon]]. Her flushed, olive skin is complemented by the wreath of moss she wears on her head. [[Art|Artists]] often draw Ashava in poses of graceful movement. On Elysium, she usually takes the form of a ball of moonlight, guiding those who get lost to safety.


## Relationships

> Ashava's followers often find much in common with worshippers of [[Cayden Cailean]] (who are eager to join a dance), [[Desna]] (who enjoy studying [[Astronomy|astronomy]]), and [[Shelyn]] (who share their appreciation of [[Music|music]]). They rarely have conflicts with devotees of other empyreal lords or [[Good|good]] deities, but sometimes chafe under the restrictions of [[Law|lawful]] ones like [[Abadar]] and [[Torag]]. Her followers share an interest in leading lost souls to the [[River of Souls|afterlife]] with [[Pharasma|Pharasmins]] and often cooperate with them to put an [[Undead|undead]] creature to rest. However, they might disagree with them on the methods: while Pharasmin [[Inquisitor|inquisitors]] only seek to destroy wayward [[Incorporeal undead|spirits]], Ashava's followers wish to peacefully guide them with words.
> Ashava despises will-o'-wisps for spreading fear of the night and the wilds, both of which she loves.


## Church of Ashava

> Ashava has a strong following along [[Varisia|Varisias]] [[Lost Coast]] and in the Varisian city of [[Magnimar]]. Most of her worshippers are Varisian [[Human|humans]]. She is also revered by [[Good|good]]-aligned natural [[Werecreature|werecreatures]], [[Duskwalker|duskwalkers]], and creatures associated with the [[Moon Golarion|Moon]].
> Temples to the True Spark are found in barrows, graveyards, wilderness areas, and isolated communities. Her [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] is the silhouette of a dancing woman in front of a full moon. Her most common minions include [[Half-celestial|half-celestial]] [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[Lunar naga|lunar nagas]], and [[Pegasus|pegasi]].
> Ashava's most devout worshippers spend an hour each day dancing in an isolated area in the moonlight. If the moon is not shining, or they cannot be alone, they pray for the lonely dead and leave a lit lantern for them somewhere dark.


### Ashavic dancers

***Main article: [[Ashavic dancer]]***
> Some followers of Ashava known as Ashavic dancers use moonlit dances to guide and save souls who have lost their way on the [[River of Souls]]. Many of these performances can turn and influence the [[Undead|undead]], speak to the dead and [[Spirit|spirits]], or ward against possession.
