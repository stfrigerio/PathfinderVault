> **Daclau-Sar** is a [[Demon lordNascent demon lord|nascent demon lord]] said to inhabit the Xorian Mountains in [[Lamashtu]]'s realm of [[Kurnugia]] in the [[Abyss]]. There he rules all scavengers, and appropriately resembles one himself: a six-legged [[Hyaena|hyaena]] with two heads and the wings of a vulture. It is believed that he was birthed from the corpse of the dead [[Deity|god]] [[Curchanus]]. Daclau-Sar is not a subtle creature, and has little time for deceptions and politics. 
> Daclau-Sar's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is the jaw of a hyaena holding rotten bones.


## Cult and worshipers

> Daclau-Sar is worshipped by several small [[Orc|orc]] clans within the [[Hold of Belkzen]] who revere him as the lord of carrion. These clans scour recent battlefields looking for prime corpses to loot for use as either trophies, to augment their fearsome [[Undead|undead]] war beasts or to augment their macabre feasts.
