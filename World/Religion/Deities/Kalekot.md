> **Kalekot** is a [[Deity|deity]] of deadly secrets and dangerous places. He is a boogeyman, an executioner of the guilty, and guardian of the lost.


## Appearance

> Kalekot appears as a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] figure with a twisted spine, withered skin, and an eyeless mask.


## Personality

> Kalekot spreads fear to keep people alive, not for the sake of fear itself. He keeps the innocent wary of dangers hiding within shadows and behind smiling faces, and reminds the guilty of an ever-approaching reckoning. A cynic, Kalekot believes he must dirty his hands to keep others' [[Soul|souls]] clean, and he despises those who are optimistic through ignorance.
