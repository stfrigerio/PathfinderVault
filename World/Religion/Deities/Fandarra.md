> **Fandarra** is an ancient deity worshiped primarily by [[Stone giant|stone giants]], although she is also followed by some humanoid races of northern [[Avistan]].



## History

> A contemporary of [[Erastil]], Fandarra stayed rooted in the old tribal traditions and never embraced civilisation. Another legend tells that she is the mother of both stone giants and [[Dire bear|dire bears]], a result of her union with [[Estig the Hunter]] (the name giants have given to Erastil).


## Appearance

> Fandarra is typically depicted as a bald female stone giant wearing a crown of leaves and a dress of red mammoth fur. Usually, she holds a haunch of meat in one hand and a stone tablet in the other. When her vengeful aspect is emphasized, she wears a necklace of knives or arrowheads. When depicted as a fertility goddess, she is pregnant, or holds twin giants in her arms.


## Worshipers and clergy

> Most of her worshipers are found among the stone, [[Frost giant|frost]], and [[Hill giant|hill giants]] of northern [[Avistan]]. Her worship requires great sacrifices, and at times of great suffering, the sacrifice of a worshiper may be necessary to appease her. Most of Fandarra's priests are [[Cleric|clerics]] and [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]]. She sometimes grants her champions magical bear and mammoth guardians of great intelligence. Some are even said to understand the [[Giant language|giant]] language.
