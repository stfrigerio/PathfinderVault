> **Zursvaater** is the father of the [[Fire giant|fire giants]], having created them millennia ago by granting them the secrets of fire and [[Metal|metal]] in exchange for their devotion. He is a secretive [[Deity|deity]] who instructed his followers to abandon inter-tribal warfare and instead attack other races.



## History

> According to fire giant folklore, Zursvaater came into being when the greatest [[Volcano|volcano]] sensed the presence of [[Stone giant|stone giants]] and formed a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] shape to speak to them. He offered them the secrets of metal and volcanic fire in exchange for worship, and they accepted, becoming the first fire giants.


## Appearance

> Zursvaater is depicted as a mighty, [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armored]] fire giant with a closed-face helmet, wielding a heavy chain in one hand.


## Home

> Zursvaater originally lived in [[Jotungard]], the shared divine realm of all [[Giant|giant]] demigods, on [[Elysium]]. After being exiled, he arrived in [[Hell]] and became fond of volcanic [[Malebolge]]. After an age of conflict with Malebolge's ruling [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Moloch]], Zursvaater was awarded Hyrrfellhame by [[Asmodeus]]; it is an immense cavern with three active volcanoes on the edge of Malebolge, given as both a punishment for Moloch and a way to gain Zursvaater's grudging thanks.


## Relationships

> Zursvaater despises the patron of [[Frost giant|frost giants]], [[Thremyr]], due to the opposition of their elements as well as Thremyr's raging fits and bloody style of warfare, which he considers disgusting. He similarly finds [[Gorum|Gorums]] warlike disposition pointless. He considers [[Minderhal]] a pale imitation of himself, much as Minderhal's stone giants are merely components of his own fire giants. Zursvaater considers [[Torag|Torags]] [[Dwarf|dwarven]] followers persistent pests, but grudgingly respects him as a smith and encourages his followers to [[Slavery|enslave]] dwarves.
