> **Flauros** (pronounced FLOR-us) is the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of fire, [[Volcano|volcanoes]] and the [[Demon|demonic]] patron of the [[Salamander|salamanders]].



## Home

> Flauros rules over his domain of the [[Bloodpyre Fields]], a realm of burning seas and constantly erupting volcanoes that seems like a dark reflection of the [[Plane of Fire]]. His home is an [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]] castle suspended within the caldera of the largest volcano of the realm located close to the domain of his putative [[Red dragon|red dragon]] lover, [[Fhengasma]].


## Relationships

 Flauros.
> Flauros has been at war with [[Ymeri|Ymeri Mistress of Fire]] for countless millennia over the salamanders and usually has the upper hand in this battle. Salamanders are elemental creatures and most elemental creatures worship the [[Elemental lord|elemental lord]] of their [[Element|element]] yet the [[Evil|evil]] salamanders have more in common with sadistic Flauros than they do with mercurial Ymeri. The enmity between them is said to stem from a failed attempt to woo Ymeri by Flauros, who did not take rejection well and is further vexed at how she endures his attacks with a stoicism bordering on disinterest. Flauros makes a point of never looting the dead or stealing Ymeri's resources on these raids, suggesting that the tools her forces wield would not survive the greater fires of his domain.


## Appearance

> Flauros appears as a huge [[Serpent|serpent]]-like creature with skin like cooling lava that cracks and bursts unable to contain the incredible heat within. To further his fearsome appearance, Flauros's head is a frightful maw of demonic teeth that belches out smoke, magma, and flame, and he wields a huge obsidian [[Spear|spear]] capable of impaling a [[Giant|giant]], which can change into a long [[Whip|whip]] of lava.


## Cult and worshippers

> Flauros's main followers are salamanders who share Flauros's serpentine form. Flauros is also worshipped by [[Drow|drow]] of the noble [[House Caldrana]] who specialise in using the powers of elemental fire to forge weapons of legendary quality.
