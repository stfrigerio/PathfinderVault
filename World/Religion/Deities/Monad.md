> The **Monad** is a [[Demigod|demigod]] that represents the transcendental [[Soul|undersoul]] of all life and the supreme oneness between the [[Aeon|aeons]] and the [[Great Beyond]] itself. Less a being than an ancient design omnipresent across all creation, the Monad is described by the aeons as simultaneously the void that predated existence, the cosmos itself, the future infinity, and the truth that binds existence, and is equated to both the cosmic fire of the [[Positive Energy Plane]] and the consuming void of the [[Negative Energy Plane]].



## Relationships

> The Monad is fixated upon the cosmic status quo. It seems content as long as the [[Plane|planes]] are in balance, but its aeon minions police the cosmos according to a design described as slightly out of synchronization with that of the [[Deity|gods]]. For this reason, it is speculated that the Monad seeks to recreate a previous existence through subtle, alien nudges.


## Appearance

> The Monad is intrinsically formless and operates through the aeons, for whom it acts as a guiding force and a source of thought. The Monad creates aeons' [[Quintessence|quintessence]] and recycles it when they are destroyed or accomplish specific goals; in that way, it behaves much like a plane.


## Servants

> The Monad is served by the aeons, and the relationship between them resembles that of a body and its constituent cells. Aeons are part of the Monad, and likewise the Monad exists in each. The Monad constantly informs each aeon about the instructions and information it needs, but the connection is imperfect, giving individual aeons some agency.
> Aeons do not limit the concept of the Monad to themselves, but include all creatures within the Great Beyond within it. A [[Human|human]] and an aeon are both emanations of the Monad, but the aeon is much closer to the source and is in direct communication with it, while the human is distant and focused on the [[Material Plane]].


## Cults

> The Monad boasts no temples and counts few followers, and only those rare few [[Mortality|mortal]] worshippers who approach an aeon's selflessness and detachment can hope to receive [[Divine magic|divine magic]] from it. They often experience flashes of insight and directives, like fledgeling aeons, and aid the aeon's work in preserving balance, usually focusing on an imbalance that common aeons do not oversee. Many of the Monad's followers are famous scholars who exert their influence to recruit new members and advance their goals, or judges and lawyers particularly capable of seeking a balance between both sides of a conflict. Because the Monad is a very distant patron (it is unknown if the Monad is even aware of its devotees), its followers often follow the guidance of lesser aeons; many are particularly adept at questioning them and interpreting their responses.
