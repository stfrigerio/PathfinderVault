>  **Calistria** (pronounced kah-LISS-tree-ah) is the [[goddess]] of lust and revenge who takes on many faces and guises. She is held in especially high regard by [[elves]], who often identify with her moods and changeable nature. A fondness for [[wasps]] has earned this vengeful deity the title the Savored Sting; such creatures live on after harming their enemies, a trait Calistria's followers hope to emulate when pursuing their goals.



## Dogma

>  Calistria is not only vengeful, but vindictive when she has been wronged by another; she will take her time returning such disfavor, maneuvering in order to attain the best position from which to enact her retribution. Her legendary trysts are well-documented, although it is difficult to conclusively determine whether these tales are tales are truth or nothing more than fantasy.


## History

>  During the [[Age of Creation]], Calistria was responsible for distracting [[Rovagug]] while [[Torag]] and [[Gorum]] forged the shell of the [[Dead Vault]], which would serve as the Rough Beast's prison after his defeat.


## Appearance

>  Calistria usually appears as a female elf of otherworldly beauty with elongated ears and limbs, and a suggestive smile playing across her face. She wears revealing clothes of flowing yellow [[silks]] that do little to hide her lithe and graceful form, and she is often depicted in the company of [[giant wasps]].


## Relationships

>  Calistria is seen as a desirable partner by a number of other gods, and stories of her trysts can be found in numerous holy texts, including her own. One such tale claims [[Cayden Cailean's]] took the [[Test of the Starstone]] because of a failed attempt to win the attention of the goddess, who claimed that no mortal could survive her charms. She is also an ally of [[Desna]], [[Norgorber]], and [[Shelyn]]—deities of dreams, secrets, and beauty, respectively.
>  She has an ongoing feud with [[Urgathoa]], as the two goddesses often vie for the same followers because of their similar portfolios: Calistria represents lust, while Urgathoa champions physical excess of all kinds.


## Realm

>  Calistria holds a relatively small (though still large by [[Material Plane]] standards) palace at the centre of the Gardens of Deceit and Delight, a shifting maze within Elarian, the shared divine realm of the [[Elven pantheon]] on [[Elysium]]. It is a place where lust and passion are freely shared and the darker aspects of each are fully embraced.


## Providence

>  Calistria holds wasps of all varieties in high regard, and those that displease the Savored Sting may find themselves plagued by swarms of the insects. Alternatively, one that pleases the goddess of lust may find themselves succeeding in pursuits of the flesh, the focus of such attentions unknowingly serving as an expression of her favor.


## Servants

>  Calistria's [[Divine servitor]] race are the [[vendenopterixes]], seductive, winged creatures who punish those who oppose the goddess. The [[empusas]] serve as Calistria's handmaidens and agents who hide within mortal societies to achieve vengeance. On Elysium, and sometimes beyond, Calistria is also served by a number of races that share her [[philosophy]] and portfolio, including [[azatas]], [[Fey]], and [[giant wasps]].


### Unique servants

Threv
This frog-like shapechanging sorcerer is obsessed with vengeance, and prefers gifts of poison or ranged magic to allow him to carry out vindictive murder.
Velvet Wing
This slender elven looking woman, with ragged insectile wings is a seductress and faithful servant of the Savored Sting, though her kind are often mistaken for succubi, they do not have the reprehensible maliciousness of those demons.
[[Menotherian]]
Appearing as a huge bear-sized black wasp, the Menotherian can also attain the form of a stunning elven beauty. She is the personification of Calistria's lust, vindictiveness and deceptive aspects as well as her Herald and most loyal servant.

### Worshipers and clergy

>  The faithful of Calistria can be found across Golarion, but her tenets of lust and vengeance have taken especially firm root in [[Absalom]], [[Galt]], [[Kyonin]], [[Nex]], [[the River Kingdoms]], [[the Shackles]], [[Taldor]], and [[Varisia]], and among [[Keleshites]], [[Taldans]], [[Tian]], [[Varisians]], elves, and [[half-elves]] throughout the [[Inner Sea region]]. The followers of the Lady in the Room fulfill varied roles wherever they are encountered, anything from spy to prostitute and beyond, but always in support of their goddesses' mercurial nature. Such individuals deal in trickery and mischief, encounters of the flesh and knowledge that is both secret or dangerous, and the pursuit of these goals can often lead these faithful to wander the world in order to achieve them.


### Elven faithful

>  Elves hold Calistria in especially high regard, though she is also popular among [[humans]] and more exotic races, such as half-elves and [[tieflings]]. The faithful of the Savored Sting includes large numbers of prostitutes, thrill seekers, and spies. Her clerics usually clothe themselves in scant garb in shades of yellow, often accented by henna dyes used on the skin.


### Temples and shrines

>  In human lands, Calistria's temples host numerous [[sacred prostitutes]] (though rumors of all her temples being brothels are untrue), and act as centers of gossip and information, assuring its continued growth in popularity. In elven lands, buildings dedicated to the Savored Sting more often resemble thieves guilds, and usually cater to those seeking information or retribution rather than more carnal pursuits.


### Holy texts

*The Book of Joy*
This book details the various passions held sacred by the goddess known as the Unquenchable Fire.
*Blood for Wine*
A collection of holy poems, these verses are sometimes quoted by [[assassins]] loyal to Calistria before they fulfill their grim tasks.

### Holidays

>  Even though there are no specific holidays that honor Calistria, the winter month of [[Calistril]] is named for her.


### Organizations

[[Order of Vengeance]]
A secret order operating in [[Galt]] from the city-state of [[Gralton]].
[[Wasp Queens]]
A group of exclusively elven and half-elven thieves who venerate Calistria's aspects of trickery and revenge.

### Favored animals

>  Gods are often associated with certain [[Animals]], either because they possess a quality that the god favors, or because the god's faithful feel a special kinship to it. Calistria's favored animals include wasps—insects renowned for their painful, relentless, and seemingly gleeful retribution—and [[poisonous animals]].
