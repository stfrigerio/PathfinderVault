![[Ceyanan.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Ceyannan, the Shepherd.
> **Ceyannan**, sometimes spelt **Ceyanan**, is an agender [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp usher]] formed from the eddies in the [[River of Souls]], created by [[Mortality|mortals]] resistance to death. Ceyannan gathers wayward [[Soul|souls]] and returns them to the [[Boneyard]], for it is said that every mortal heart contains a piece of Ceyannan, which the Shepherd seeks to recover. Once the last mortal dies, Ceyannan will finally be whole and embrace death themself. Ceyannan is also responsible for containing souls that pose a threat to the cosmos.


## Home

> Ceyannan wanders the [[Material Plane]] and the [[River of Souls]] in search for lost souls, and has no divine realm.


## Appearance

> Ceyannan resembles an androgynous, beautiful [[Humanoid|humanoid]] with maggot-white skin and the wings of a carrion [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird]]. The Shepherd carries the *Apostasy*, a shepherd's crook that can drag out any mortal soul's faith.
