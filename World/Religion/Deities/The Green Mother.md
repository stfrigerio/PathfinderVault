> **The Green Mother** is one of the [[Eldest]], a [[Deity|divine]] [[Fey|fey]] creature of tremendous power able to reshape the very fabric of the [[First World]] on a whim. She embodies seduction as an integral, dangerous part of the natural world, unbound by conventional notions of morality. She is probably the most manipulative entity of the First World, engineering [[Plane|plane]]-spanning schemes and often using seduction to get her way. Despite her dark humour and [[Evil|evil]] tricks, the Green Mother views herself as an impartial guide for natural selection by exploiting weaknesses.



## Home

> The Green Mother sits on the Bloodpetal Throne within her domain, the Hanging Bower deep within the Silkwood on the First World. Her court is the centre of gossip on the First World. She tolerates guests and lovers as long as they do not abuse her favour.


## Appearance

> The Green Mother is a creature of great beauty, typically depicted as a tall, green-haired, bark-skinned [[Humanoid|humanoid]] woman with a combination of [[Elf|elf]], [[Dryad|dryad]], and [[Bestiary/Nymph|nymph]] characteristics. Her body constantly shifts and integrates natural features.


## Relationships

> The Green Mother is on good terms with the other Eldest, who only trust her to value her own self-interest. She has romantically fixated on [[The Lost Prince|the Lost Prince]], and all of her advances towards him have failed.


## Servants

> On the First World and the [[Material Plane]], the Green Mother is often served by dryads, [[Mite|mites]], nymphs, [[Plant|plant creatures]], [[Satyr|satyrs]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spiders]]. She was responsible for creating the original [[Sard|sard]], which still resides at the Sardscar in the Hanging Bower.


## Church of the Green Mother

> The Green Mother's worshipers tend to congregate and build her temples in forest glens, spider nests, and tree houses.
