> **Lady Nanbyo** is the [[Tian Xia]] [[Deity|goddess]] of ill fate and calamity. She is often blamed for [[Plague|plagues]], flash floods, tsunamis, and any other natural disaster that occurs.



## Appearance

> Known as the 'Widow of Calamities', Lady Nanbyo has two forms. First, she is able to appear as an extremely seductive woman. It is thought, however, that her true form is that of a ravenous, fire-spewing [[Dragon|dragon]] that has a dozen legs.


## History

> It is said that Lady Nanbyo has previously been married many times but each of these unions led to a sometimes tragic, sometimes terrible demise for each of her former husbands.


## Holy symbol and animal

> Her [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a crack in the earth with flames erupting from it. Her [[Sacred animal|sacred animal]] is the carrion-eating crow.


## Church of Lady Nanbyo

> Despite her role as a deity of calamity, many people still pray to Lady Nanbyo, normally for deliverance from the horrible events she unleashes upon the world. In addition to plagues, flash floods, and earthquakes, Lady Nanbyo is also often blamed for particularly devastating tsunamis and [[Volcanic|volcanic]] eruptions, even though these are normally more associated with [[Hei Feng]] and [[Yamatsumi]], respectively. This is because Lady Nanbyo relishes adding her own special miseries to such events, revelling in the suffering that they cause.
> Cults dedicated to Lady Nanbyo are a particular problem in metropolitan [[Goka]] where they make the already free-wheeling city even more dangerous. She is also commonly worshipped amongst the flooded reaches of [[Wanshou]], the desolate deserts of [[Shaguang]], monster-haunted [[Shenmen]], and the lawless isles of [[Minata]].
