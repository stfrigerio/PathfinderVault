> **Hathor** is a [[Cattle|cow-headed]] [[Deity|deity]] and a member of the [[Osirian pantheon|pantheon]] often worshiped in [[Ancient Osirion]]. Known as the **Mistress of Jubilation**, Hathor's portfolio includes dance, joy, love, music, and the sky.


## Dogma

> Hathor teaches her faithful to support new families, to encourage and support musicians, to protect miners and traders, and to support love. She strongly opposes discrimination based on outward appearances, along with any attempt to disfigure another person or creature, and believes that refusing nourishment to those who hunger is a sin.


## Relationships

> Hathor is a daughter of [[Ra]] and the sibling of [[Bastet]], [[Maat]], and [[Sekhmet]] as well as the consort of [[Horus]]. Below is a diagram of the familial relationships between the gods of the Osirian pantheon.
