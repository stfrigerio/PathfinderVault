> Lord of all the [[Div|divs]], **Ahriman** is the embodiment of pure destruction and seeks the utter obliteration of existence through his div servants. Ahriman is a [[Demigod|demigod]], and his [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a black circle edged with a thin sliver of [[Silver|silver]], depicting light eclipsed by darkness.



## Appearance

> Ahriman is terrifying to behold: an amalgam of vicious predators far more terrible than the sum of its parts. Ahriman's feet are vulture-like, with wicked flesh-rending talons, while his hands sport the claws of a huge [[Tiger|tiger]] that are capable of tearing a [[Giant|giant]] clean in two.
> His scarred, [[Humanoid|humanoid]] body writhes with living [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]] and whipping chains that lash out and [[Poison|poison]] those near him. His face looks like a tiger's with an expression of pure hatred and is crowned with four gnarled horns etched with ancient curses. From Ahriman's maw come inhuman screams that are not his own, and a darkness that is more than just shadow. Those swallowed by Ahriman plunge for all eternity down a bottomless pit filled with the deafening praises and heresies dedicated to Ahriman.


## History

> Ahriman's origin is shrouded in mystery and legend. The [[Jinn|jinn]] believe Ahriman and the first jinn came into being simultaneously, the latter as the shadow of Creation's inevitable destruction. Ahriman is both a creature and force of nature; he is the destruction that must inevitably come to all things in order to keep existence in balance, and, as such, he is the enemy of all creation.
> In ancient times, [[Osirion|Osirions]] [[Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues]] constructed a mighty edifice known as the [[House of Oblivion]] in the desert of [[Thuvia]] in an effort to entice Ahriman to [[Golarion]]. The attempt succeeded, and Ahriman arrived with a large number of div followers. Ahriman agreed to support the [[Pharaoh|pharaoh]] in return for the House. This support was not enough to prevent the pharaoh from being overthrown by the [[Song Pharaoh]] in [[-3047 AR]], however, and Ahriman returned to [[Abaddon]].


## Home

> Ahriman rules from his throne in the realm of Ahermanabad, atop Mount Kaf—itself carved from fallen monuments—at the edge of [[Abaddon]] under a dark apocalyptic void which dominates its sky. It is from here that Ahriman sets his dark designs on the rest of the [[Multiverse|multiverse]].


## Servants

> The div, of whom Ahriman is lord, are a race of [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]] created from the essence of jinn he corrupted that revel in destruction and misery; specifically, they seek to destroy the works that [[Mortal|mortals]] create, much like the [[Daemon|daemons]] with whom they share Abaddon. Beyond this, Ahriman also created the [[Undead|undead]] [[Ghul|ghuls]] from twisted [[Janni|jann]], to vex and destroy mortal life and the despotic [[Fiendish|fiendish]] [[Dragon|dragons]] known as [[Azi|azi]]. While it might seem a paradox that an embodiment of destruction could also create new forms of life, he does so only to hasten the destruction of the rest of the multiverse.
> Ahriman's hatred of life is so great that any creature he kills is instantly reanimated as a powerful undead (usually a [[Wight|wight]]) that serves him loyally in his destructive quests. Ahriman's favourite form of ruin is the corruption of mortal desires, often through the use of manipulated *wish* [[Spell|spells]].


### Unique Servants

> Ahriman is almost always attended by powerful [[Akvan|akvan]] princes who serve as his bodyguards. These unholy servitors have names such as Crumbling Earth, Dying Ember, Gasping Wind, Thirsty Sea, and Unbalanced Soul.


## Worshippers

> Despite his abhorrence for all life, cells of cultists on Golarion worship Ahriman, collectively called the [[Usij]]. These deranged nihilists channel Ahriman's power and inspiration to realize their destructive plots. Originally from [[Kelesh]], the Usij are no longer as numerous as they once were, after purges by followers of [[Sarenrae]]. That said, the Usij are insidious and have rebounded, particularly in desert regions, seeking to corrupt and destroy everything around them.


### Obedience

> Some followers of Ahriman gain special unholy favor from Ahriman, either through self-flagellation or destroying things of value to others, ideally in front of those who value them.
