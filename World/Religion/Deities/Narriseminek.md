> **Narriseminek**, the **Crownless** or **the Maker of Kings**, is a gender-fluid [[Protean lord|protean lord]] who spends most of their time turning lesser [[Protean|proteans]] into [[Keketar|keketars]] or [[Izfiitar|izfiitars]], or granting [[Philosophy|philosophy]]-changing visions to choruses.


## Home

> The name of Narriseminek's domain is sung and incomprehensible to non-proteans, but is commonly called the Drifting Mountain of Narriseminek the Crownless. It is located within the [[Borderlands]] between the [[Maelstrom]] and [[Nirvana]], and contains a great temple to the [[Speakers of the Depths]], and the mysterious [[Artifact|artifact]] known as the *Singing-Luminous Eye of the Speakers*.


## Appearance

> Narriseminek often appears as a [[Naunet|naunet]], [[Imentesh|imentesh]], or keketar with a scar or burn mark on their head. However, this is not Narriseminek's true form, which is rarely observed and resembles a golden, iridescent protean with empty eye sockets, crowned by dozens of burning, drifting eyes that form the shape of a halo.
