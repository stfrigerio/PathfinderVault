![[Stargazer_of_Pulura.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A [[World/Items & Equipment/Ships/Stargazer]] of Pulura sporting the [[holy symbol]] of his goddess as a tattoo on his chest.
>  **Pulura**, the mistress of the [[stars]] and the aurora, is an [[Angel]] [[Empyreal lord]], the patron of those travellers that become homesick, lost, or injured in the snowy wastes of the far north.



## Home

>  Pulura prefers the [[Material Plane]] to [[Elysium]], and keeps a number of homes hidden in the stars. When [[Desna]] requires her counsel, Pulura often visits [[Cynosure]]; and Pulura's followers are often sent to Cynosure after death.


## Appearance

>  Pulura appears as a lovely, alluring [[Tian]] woman with the grace of a dancer, a gravity about her expression, and black, flowing hair gleaming with the light of stars. Her robes appear to be made from green and pink light, and flicker with every one of her movements. She often appears dancing amid the aurora borealis in the skies of far northern lands, and legend has it that her extraordinary beauty will burn any [[mortals]] who dare approach her too closely. She wields a [[sling]] made from sighs that fires bullets of starlight.


## Cults

>  Pulura is worshipped by denizens of the far north who believe that the aurora is an omen of her [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good]] deeds. They tell about the [[constellations]] to help others learn the night sky and to pass on stories of goodness and light. They also believe in the connection between the colour of plankton and the auroras they reflect.
>  Some sailors believe that if they are homesick, they can be lured from their [[ships]] by a beautiful woman wrapped in a cloak of flickering light, reaching for them from the water's surface. If they go overboard and drown, Pulura will take their [[souls]] to her palace to keep them company, but their longing is never satisfied and, bitterly, she will eventually have to let them go.


## On Golarion

>  On [[Golarion]], Pulura's influence is believed to be strongest at the [[Shining Sea]], which has become a pilgrimage site for many of her followers.
>  Pulura was worshiped as a major [[Deity]] in the lost [[Kellid]] realm of [[Sarkoris]]. The Sarkorians saw her and the [[Demon lord]] [[Kostchtchie]] as dualistic [[gods]] of cold. She was honoured by a mighty ring of idols in the city of [[Dyinglight]] but, in common with the rest of Sarkoris, the city fell to the [[demons]] of the [[Worldwound]]. A cascade named for her, [[Pulura's Fall]], once flowed to the northeast of [[Iz]]; it has since been swallowed by the Worldwound, but its namesake, a temple to Pulura, remains, and has been withstanding a [[demonic]] siege for more than a century. An idol to Pulura stands on the [[Walk of Lost Gods]] in the ravaged town of [[Gundrun]].


### Artifacts

>  Pulura is associated with the legendary [[Artifact]] known as the *[[Barding of pleated light]]*.
