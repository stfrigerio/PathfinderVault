> **General Susumu**, also known as the **Black Daimyo**, is the [[Tian Xia]] patron [[Deity|deity]] of [[Samurai|samurai]] who are interested more in glory and battle than honor and heroism.



## Appearance

> In his [[Human|human]] form, General Susumu is depicted as a towering [[Tian-Min]] man with red skin and bristling eyebrows; he wears an ornate set of black o-yoroi [[Armour|armour]]. He rides a black winged [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]] and, in battle, he wields an [[Iron|iron]] longbow that shoots arrows of pure fire. When his anger is truly roused General Susumu abandons his human form, instead becoming an enormous crimson [[Dragon|dragon]] with obsidian tusks.


## Holy Symbol

> General Susumu's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a black winged horse.


## Relationships

> General Susumu is the half-brother of [[Shizuru]], the so-called Empress of Heaven and goddess of the [[Sun|sun]], honour, and virtuous samurai. Obviously, General Susumu and his sister seldom see eye to eye.


## Church of General Susumu

> General Susumu is worshipped primarily in the monstrous realm of [[Chu Ye]]; the lands of the Horse Lords, [[Hongal]]; the aggressive [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]] kingdom of [[Kaoling]]; the samurai kingdoms of [[Minkai]] and [[Shokuro]]; and [[Xa Hoi]]. General Susumu has been known to appear at the site of great conflicts, sometimes to merely watch but at other times leading a great army of deceased samurai into combat for the sheer thrill of fighting. [[Dhucharg]], the capital city of Kaoling, boasts a particularly large temple dedicated to General Susumu called the Palace of the Black Daimyo.
