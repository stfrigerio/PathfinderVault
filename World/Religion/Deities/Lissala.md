> **Lissala** (pronounced lis-SALL-uh) is the [[Deity|goddess]] of [[Rune|runes]], fate, and the reward of service, and was once a major religious force in the empire of [[Thassilon]]. She was depicted either as a stern woman with no mouth, or as a creature with a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]] lower half, a [[Human|human]] woman's upper half, six wings, and a *[[Sihedron]]* for a head.



## History

> Lissala's faith originated on [[Azlant]], where she started off as a [[Demigod|demigoddess]] whom few people understood.
> When Thassilon was founded, its [[Xin|First King Xin]], a follower of Lissala, brought her faith to [[Avistan]] from Azlant, where it saw a renaissance. She taught the [[Philosophy|philosophy]] of the [[Seven virtues of rule|seven virtues of rule]], guidelines that promised rewards for both rulers and their subjects if her teachings were strictly followed. These were eventually perverted into the seven mortal sins by the [[Runelords|runelords]]; Lissala eventually embraced the [[Evil|evil]] [[Sin magic|sin magic]] and became a true [[Deity|deity]]. She also outlined the workings of fate to her followers. Lissala also seems to have been, if not the source, then one of the major teachers of the art of rune magic, through which the rulers of Thassilon erected their mighty works and controlled the populace.
> Near the end of Azlant and Thassilon, the Lissalan cults who stayed in Azlant dwindled in number and were regarded as heretics by the Thassilonian cults, who often sent missionaries to purge them. [[Krune]], the final runelord of sloth, was also her final chief priest. During the reign of the runelords, her religion become more slavish and violent, emphasizing flagellation and mortification of the flesh.

Lissala in her warlike aspect.
> After [[Earthfall]], which destroyed both Azlant and Thassilon, Lissala's cult was almost wiped out on Golarion. In [[4713 AR]], the Lissalans resurfaced to free their leader Krune, but he only lived long enough to be defeated and killed by agents of the [[Pathfinder Society]].


## Relationships

> Lissala was a rival of [[Amaznen]], the other Azlanti god of magic. Their disagreement stemmed from the fact that Amaznen taught that some knowledge should be kept secret, while Lissala believed that knowledge should always be shared.
> Some Lissalan cults were enticed by the dogma of [[Sicva]] and sometimes worked alongside her followers, as both goddesses recognised the importance of duty and structure.


## Servants

> Chief among Lissala's servants is her [[Herald|herald]], [[Kurshu the Undying]], whom she created from the parts of many different creatures.


## Unholy symbols

> Lissala is known to have two types of [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbols]]: her main symbol is a variant *[[Sihedron]]* rune (see right); her second type was a [[Whip|whip]] twisted into the keyed rune of the particular rune magic practitioner using it.


## Church of Lissala

> Those few followers remaining believe that knowledge can be gained by following a path of self-harm in an attempt to burn knowledge into their minds. [[Rune giant|Rune giants]] refuse to believe Lissala is dead and continue to worship her.
> Rumors have been growing that [[Cleric|clerics]] of Lissala have been reappearing, and that some of the runes of Thassilon retain some connection to her.


### Temples and shrines

> Only the ruins of the [[Great Temple of Lissala]] and the smaller temples in fabled [[Xin-Shalast]] in [[Varisia]] and the [[Hold of Belkzen]] remain to indicate the awesome power she once wielded over the hearts and minds of the ancient Thassilonians.


### Holidays

> One of Lissala's high holidays is known as the [[Feast of Sigils]].


> [[Paizo]] published a major article about Lissala in *[[Into the Nightmare Rift]]* 70*ff.*
