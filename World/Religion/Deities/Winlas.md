> **Winlas** is a powerful [[Archon|archon]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] who oversees the [[Great Library of Harmonious Scripture]] on [[Requius]], the fourth level of [[Heaven]]. There he maintains a record of every sacred ceremony in the [[Multiverse|multiverse]] in an effort to fight the [[Evil|evil]] caused by their profanation.



## Dogma

> As the chronicler of all sacred religious ceremonies, Winlas preaches the importance of [[Ritual|ritual]] as a way of bringing the faithful together. He believes that there is power in numbers and that ceremonies are not simply distant prescriptions, but are passed down by the [[Deity|divine]] and adapted by pious [[Mortal|mortals]]. The Elder of Divinity does not believe in loose interpretation or expansion of rituals, and he and his servants encourage strict adherence to established ceremony and dogma.


## Appearance

> Winlas appears as an old man with skin the color of unspoiled parchment standing about 11 feet tall. He carries a massive tome in his arms and is dressed in unblemished white [[Silk|silk]] robes covering a heavily brocaded blue tunic trimmed in [[Gold|gold]]. Hanging from his shoulders is a tapestry depicting countless religious observances traced with [[Silver|silver]] thread, and he wears a four-pointed golden crown on his head.


## Servants

> Winlas is assisted in his divine task by countless [[Harbinger archon|harbinger archons]].


### Herald

> [[Anwigasi]] is the [[Herald|herald]] of Winlas on the [[Material Plane]]. A [[Half-celestial|half-celestial]] [[Couatl|couatl]], Anwigasi is believed to be the offspring of the Elder of Divinity's first priestess and a plumed [[Dragon|dragon]]. Unlike most other heralds who spend most of their time in the [[Outer Plane|Outer Planes]] and only occasionally venture onto the Material, Anwigasi has been watching over the small religious community of [[Saruhk]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] since before the death of [[Aroden]].


## Church of Winlas

> Winlas finds most of his adherents among community leaders, congregation elders, and various lay and anointed officiants. Centers of worship can generally be found in community centers, grand cathedrals, and other holy sites.


### Obedience

> Certain dedicated worshipers of Winlas perform daily [[Obedience|obediences]] in order to receive [[Divine magic|divine]] blessings known as a [[Boon|boons]] from their god. The obedience takes the form of a complex ritual involving standing, kneeling, and lying prone for various intervals, all while reciting at least three different holy texts.
