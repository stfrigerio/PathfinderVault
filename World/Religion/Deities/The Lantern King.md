> **The Lantern King** is one of the [[Eldest]], a [[Deity|divine]] [[Fey|fey]] creature of tremendous power said to be able to reshape the very fabric of the [[First World]] on a whim. He is known for his capacity as a trickster [[Deity|god]] mixing caprice and mischief in god-like capacity within a realm already full of such practice. His sense of humor is vast, both in its breadth and its potential for harm, and his pranks, even well-intentioned ones, are not always pleasant or convenient. However, those that have spent a long time in his presence note that behind the Lantern King's mischief is a cunning, cosmic-level schemer influencing numerous major events across the [[Great Beyond]].



## Appearance

> The Lantern King resembles a foot-wide ball of golden light surrounded by a circlet made out of glyphs. When expressing a point or emotion, he often changes colour. Because of this resemblance, he is sometimes suspected to be the progenitor of [[Will-o'-wisp|will-o-wisps]] or the original model for [[Lantern archon|lantern archons]], but the fey lord derisively laughs off such claims. He speaks in a booming, merry baritone which is the only indicator of his gender. The Lantern King is also capable of taking the forms of other creatures, including other Eldest, to cause mischief.


## Home

> The Lantern King has no permanent abode. He wanders freely through the fields and forests of the First World, bending reality and changing lives wherever he goes, and is often blamed when a traveller is led astray. He is particularly fond of the [[Witchmarket]], a caravan that travels across the First World and into the [[Material Plane]].


## Relationships

> The other Eldest cautiously respect the Lantern King, as even they are not immune to his pranks, particularly [[Ragadahn]] and [[The Lost Prince|the Lost Prince]], whom he considers too serious. He is mysteriously friendly with [[Ng]], and respects [[Shyka]], who has seen all of his schemes and is hard to fool.


## Cults

> The Lantern King cares little for worshippers but is willing to provide [[Divine magic|power]] to them whenever he feels like doing so. *To meet the King* is a First World expression meaning *finding oneself subject to strange fortune*, and seekers of the Lantern King rarely return the same.
