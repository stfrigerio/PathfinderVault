>  The [[Demon lord]] **Zura** (pronounced ZOO-rah) is also known as the Vampire Queen, and is worshiped by [[cannibals]], [[Drow]], and of course, [[vampires]]. Her unholy symbol is a blood-red, fanged skull, embossed with runes.



## History

>  Zura is believed to be the first vampire in all of creation. Supposedly she was an ancient [[Azlanti]] queen who possessed a lust for eternal life so great she eventually resorted to feeding on her own kind. Even thousands of years later, people still whisper the legends of her decadent, savage feasts and her baths of warm [[Human]] blood. Some scholars even claim that her ascension heralded the beginning of the ancient [[Azlant]] empire's descent into decadence and eventual destruction at the beginning of the [[Age of Darkness]]. Her sinfulness was so great that, on her death by botched suicide, her soul was sent to the [[Abyss]], where she immediately arose as a [[Succubus]] vampire. Her remaining family members changed their names and went into hiding after their estates were plundered and razed. Before [[Earthfall]] she had ascended to demon lord status.


## Home

>  Zura now calls the mountainous [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Nesh]] her home. Nesh has a large number of villages inhabited by captured [[humanoids]] harvested from the [[Material Plane]]. They are, for the most part, unaware that they dwell deep in the Abyss, except the leaders, who are rewarded by Zura's minions to keep the truth hidden.


## Relationships

>  It is unclear whether Zura worshiped [[Urgathoa]], the Pallid Princess, in life, but as a demon lord, their relationship is mercurial: sometimes they (and thus their worshipers) are firm allies and at other times they are at war.


## Appearance

>  She is said to appear as a voluptuous woman, with a dark gothic beauty that is almost impossible to resist. This beautiful form is merely a ruse she uses to seduce her victims; her true form is that of an emaciated woman with [[bat-like]] wings in place of arms, blood-red eyes and hair, large fangs, and taloned feet.


## Cult and worshipers

>  Zura's worship is most common wherever blood-thirsty vampires and their thralls can be found. She is most commonly worshiped in the haunted counties of [[Ustalav]] and decadent cities of [[Cheliax]]. Azlanti ruins may attract Azlanti vampires who tend shrines to Zura there.
>  In the benighted depths of [[Sekamina]], Zura is worshiped by the [[Drow]] of [[House Rasivrein]], who serve as the slave masters of the decadent drow cities.
>  Zura is one of the [[Three Feasters]], the deities worshiped by the [[Koboto]] tribe of the [[Sodden Lands]]. In the [[Mwangi Expanse]], Zura is one of the main demons worshiped by the [[Bekyar]] tribes and the ferocious halflings of the [[Kaava Lands]]. One version of the legend of the mythical lost city of [[Zurakai]] is that it was founded by followers of Zura. Some [[Sabosan]], failing to get spells from their erstwhile demon lord, [[Vyriavaxus]], have turned to Zura.
>  In the [[Ustalavic]] county of [[Odranto]], a tribe of surface-dwelling [[xulgaths]] known as the Marshworth Clutch worship Zura. The clutch has undertaken some unique and bloodthirsty rituals to secure her divine favour and now they are known to have an unnatural mastery of their enemy's blood.
>  Zura is the most popular of the demon lords commonly worshiped by the [[orcs]] and is normally worshiped by tribes of degenerate cannibals. These orcs embrace their daylight vulnerability by rejecting sunlight entirely and trying to only emerge at night. These tribes are normally led by either a [[cleric]] of Zura or an actual orc vampire.
>  Cultists of Urgathoa mirror the relationship of their goddess with Zura cultists: sometimes they work together, sometimes cultists of one are sacrificed to the other. Maybe this conflict is due to the similar natures of the goddess' and the demon lord's portfolios.
