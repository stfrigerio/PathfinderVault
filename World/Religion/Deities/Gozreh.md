> **Gozreh** (pronounced GOHZ-ray) is a dualistic [[Deity|deity]] of nature, a god of the storm and sky and also a goddess of the wave and surf. Born of the ocean's fury and the wind's wrath, Gozreh is a fickle deity.



## History

> Gozreh is an ancient deity, thought to have existed for as long as the wind has blown and the waters swelled. His faithful are to be found in all places of nature, doing her will as they have for eons. He is counted among one of the original gods that fought against [[Rovagug]] in the defense of all creation.


## Home

> Being concerned with only nature, Gozreh ceaselessly wanders across the [[Material Plane]] in the form of waves or storms, keeping no permanent divine realm and caring little about other gods. According to a hypothesis, Gozreh is the deity with the most connection to the [[First World]] because of its primal life energy and wild nature, yet on the surface he seems as distant to the First World as other deities are, perhaps because Gozreh thinks that consistent physics that governs nature is necessary.


## Appearance

> Gozreh appears as a colossal [[Humanoid|humanoid]] (often of [[Mwangi]] ethnicity) whose lower body trails away into a mass of roiling elemental matter, but whose gender is dependent on his aspect. Her female form is associated with the sea, and appears as a young and beautiful woman with wild green hair whose torso merges with the roiling sea. His male half represents the winds and clouds, and appears as a weathered old man with a long white beard whose lower body melds into a storm cloud. Images of Gozreh typically present his two forms reaching up from the sea and down from the heavens to touch one another in midair.


## Relationships

> Gozreh mostly remains neutral towards the other gods unless they bring threats to his dominion. Despite this, he often comes into conflict with [[Rovagug]], [[Nethys]], and [[Urgathoa]], for their destructive or corrupting influences on the world. He is often at odds with [[Abadar]] over the encroachments of civilization on nature, yet cordial with [[Erastil]] and [[Desna]]. Erastil, in particular, is considered somewhat of a friend, due to their shared respect for nature. Followers of Gozreh also find they have much in common with those who follow Golarion's other major nature religion, the [[Green Faith]].
> In ancient days, Gozreh's followers sometimes came into conflict with those of [[Jaidi]], who sought to harness nature to benefit society. In the later [[Age of Legend]], Gozreh's worship began to overlap with that of [[Onos]], who was believed to better understand and control the elements, especially fire and earth.


## Providence

> Gozreh shows his favor by the sudden appearance of a gentle breeze that carries with it the smell of blooming flowers, the unexpected sound of waves crashing on a shore, or dreams involving a specific, and unusual-looking [[Animal|animal]]. His displeasure is seen in the sudden appearance of extremely localized storms or other bad weather, being watched or hounded by birds or beasts, or the continuous taste of blood in one's mouth.


## Servants

 
 The wrath of Gozreh.
> Nature and all its creatures are considered to be Gozreh's domain, but he favors seabirds, flying fish, and frogs. [[Xocothian|Xocothians]] are Gozreh's race of [[Divine servitor|divine servitors]]. These dualistic [[Outsider|outsiders]] resemble a combination of seabird and flying fish.


### Unique servants

> His direct servants include:

Kraz'Tesh
This favored servant of Gozreh is an icy dragonfly-like creature.
[[Personification of Fury]]
Appearing as an ancient [[Elemental|elemental]], a fusion of wind and wave, Gozreh's [[Herald|herald]] serves her interests across the planes.
[[Saltbeard]]
This favored servant of Gozreh is a dour [[Triton|triton]] [[Cleric|cleric]].

## Church of Gozreh


### Worshipers

> Gozreh is an ancient deity, having been worshipped by [[Human|humans]] long before the [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]] started meddling with the [[Azlanti human ethnicity|Azlanti]]. Many sailors and navigators trusted in Gozreh and followed her teachings at sea. Despite the Azlanti's advancement, they never developed weather forecast, and although they progressively found less reverence in nature (turning to the guidance of Jaidi instead), the weather aspect of Gozreh's faith remained strong. Gozreh's priests were granted the understanding of how a warming ocean could lead to a devastating hurricane.
> Gozreh is worshiped wherever nature is feared or held in high esteem, but his followers are most commonly found in the [[Mwangi Expanse]], [[Vidrian]], the [[Shackles]], the [[Sodden Lands]], the [[Steaming Sea]], [[Thuvia]], and [[Varisia]], and among the [[Mwangi]], [[Varisian|Varisians]], and [[Gnome|gnomes]] throughout the [[Inner Sea region]]. Most sailors pay homage to him, at least in passing, praying for safe passage on their travels, and her clergy is expected to bless new crops during the planting season.
> The [[Bonuwat]] people of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] worship a variant form of Gozreh, a janiform amalgam with Desna, whom they call *[[Shimye-Magalla]]*.
> [[Vudrani]] people particularly worship Gozreh's female side as **She Who Guides the Wind and the Waves**.
> Shortly after the appearance of the [[Eye of Abendego]], a splinter-cult of Gozreh called the [[Storm Kindlers]] became convinced the Eye was a manifestation of their god. They flocked to the Sodden Lands, but were unable to cope with the harsh realities of life in the region and soon died. Their leaders wore magical masks that helped them navigate the flooded land, and some of these masks survive and are now worn by inhabitants of the Sodden Lands, who call them *[[Goz mask|Goz masks]]*.
> Most [[Cloud giant|cloud giants]] worship Gozreh as **Ioz'om, the Sky Father**, and believe that they are all his descendants. [[Storm giant|Storm giants]] worship Gozreh as the father-sky god **Hyjarth** and the mother-sea goddess **Tourithia**.


### Clergy

> Priests of Gozreh are rugged folk and many are hermits. Men are expected to have long beards and women long hair. Seaweed, natural items, and strands of white cloth are often braided into the hair of the faithful. Formal raiment is usually long robes of sea-green, storm-grey, or sky blue color, decorated with coral or pearls. Although most [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] in the [[Inner Sea region]] are followers of the [[Green Faith]], a significant minority of them worship Gozreh instead.


### Temples and shrines

> Temples of Gozreh are always open to the sky and often contain some sort of pool or open water at the heart. They often appear in out-of-the-way places and are typically built using only slightly worked local materials, such as driftwood and unquarried stone. Services and occasions vary from temple to temple, though most ceremonies involve offerings, prayers, and chanting. Some temples venerate either his male or female forms and portfolio, while churches in port cities most often worship both at once.


### Holy texts

> Gozreh's texts are typically guides to natural life, almanacs of tides and such things, interspersed with chants and prayers and suggested offerings to the fickle deity.

*Hymns to the Winds and Waves* or *Hymns to the Wind and the Waves*
This book includes susurrant prayers, rules for personal behavior, and the respect of nature.

### Holidays

> Gozreh's followers celebrate [[Firstbloom]] on the [[Vernal equinox|vernal equinox]] and Currentseve on 7 [[Gozran]]. The spring month of Gozran is named in the god's honor.


### Favored animals

> Gods are often associated with certain [[Animal|animals]], either because they possess a quality favored by the god, or because the god's faithful feel a special kinship to them. Unlike the other gods who only favor certain animals, Gozreh favors all of them.
> Due to being both aquatic and aerial beings tied to both the sea and rain, [[Tidehawk|tidehawks]] are often seen as being favored creatures of Gozreh. There is disagreement among sailors regarding whether sighting a tidehawk is a good omen or a bad one, as the ocean, tidehawks and Gozreh are all quick to shift between calm and fury.
