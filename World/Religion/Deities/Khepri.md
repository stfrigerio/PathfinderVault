> The cult of **Khepri**, the dung beetle, is common among the peasants and laborers of [[Osirion]]. Khepri represents those who toil in ignominy and squalor. He is a trickster, turning the indignity of his appearance and labor upon those who consider themselves refined, elevated, and superior to others.
