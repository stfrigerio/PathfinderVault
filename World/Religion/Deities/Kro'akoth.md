> **Kro'akoth** led [[Abyss|Abyssal]] armies as a general known as the Fire Serpent until, upon witnessing a great army of [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] sacrifice themselves for [[Lamashtu]], he decided to pursue true power through the worship of other creatures. His initial followers were [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]], but he has expanded into other groups of unclaimed followers, inserting himself into forgotten cults or presenting himself to those who formerly lacked deities or worshiped false ones, not revealing what he truly was in many of these cases.


## Appearance

> Kro'akoth appears as a stone [[Serpent|serpent]] with a burning head.
