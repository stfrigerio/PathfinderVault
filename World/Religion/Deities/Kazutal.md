![[Kazutal.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A depiction of Kazutal.
> **Kazutal** is an [[Arcadian human ethnicity|Arcadian]] [[Deity|goddess]] of community, liberty, and safety. She is also known as Majagua to the Matanji [[Orc|orcs]].



## History

> Kazutal's faith arose in [[Razatlan]] during the [[Age of Legend]]. In this ancient, difficult time, she was an aggressive goddess and concerned herself with protection and strength as her followers established a tyrannical empire across [[Arcadia]]. After [[Earthfall]], Razatlan lost its grasp on its subjugated territories, and Kazutal's clergy called on her strength to protect the communities in the [[Age of Darkness]]. Her faith became more compassionate, and grew as her priests sought to unite the survivors of Earthfall in the former territory of Razatlan.


## Home

> Kazutal's divine realm is the Root of the Sky in [[Nirvana]]. She lives in a massive pyramid surrounded by parks at the centre of a city.


## Relationships

> Kazutal is friendly with most [[Good|good]] Arcadian deities, like the [[Three Sisters]], as well as deities from other parts of [[Golarion]]. She agrees with [[Erastil|Erastils]] concern for family but disagrees with him on some finer points. She shares [[Kurgess]] goal of strength and community, considers [[Milani]] brash but supports her fight against tyranny, and often confers with [[Jaidi]] on the belief that his promotion of agriculture and self-sufficiency are instrumental to strong communities. She also often allies with [[Demigod|demigods]] such as the [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lords]], as well as with good Arcadian god-kings and heroes, to increase their power and influence.
> Kazutal does not strongly associate with deities that are extremely [[Law|lawful]] or [[Chaos|chaotic]]. Her arch-enemy is the [[Evil|evil]] death god [[Ohachtsik]], who often preys upon her followers.
