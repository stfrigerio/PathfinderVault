> **Alazhra the Dream Eater** is the main deity of the [[Night hag|night hags]]. Some sages speculate that Alazhra may be a night hag who achieved divinity. The night hags themselves claim to be the favoured daughters of Alazhra, rather than an offshoot of the [[Hag|hags]] of the [[Material Plane]]. She appears to her worshipers in nightmares, and supposedly has the power to scare those who displease her to death in their dreams.


## Alazhra and the Four Horsemen

> Due to an unspoken agreement between Alazhra and the [[Four Horsemen]], night hags are allowed to travel and trade [[Soul|souls]] freely within [[Abaddon]].
