> **Prathos** is a [[Cyclops|cyclops]] god. Amongst his contemporary worshippers are the mad [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of the small town of [[Katrivish]] in [[Iobaria]], who pluck out one eye to honour him and the cyclopes; their worship and sacrifices grant them wisdom and aids them in defending their woods.
