>  The [[Archdevil]] **Mammon** (pronounced mam-MONN, and sometimes spelt 'Mamon') is [[Hell]]'s accountant and treasurer.  He rules over the lightless realm of [[Erebus]], the third plane of Hell, metaphorically located beneath the [[Iron City of Dis]]. His [[unholy symbol]] is a azure [[coin]] with the head of Mammon stamped on it.



## Appearance

>  Mammon once looked like a majestic angel with sleek muscles, gleaming eyes, and white hair; he retained this form after his fall until he was defeated by Sarenrae. Now, all kinds of wealth in Erebus contribute to his body. When receiving visitors, he possesses the **Argent Prince**, a silvery replica of Mammon's old angelic body. When attending council with fellow archdevils, he instructs his servants to carry a specifically chosen trove to Nessus, so that he can take the most majestic form possible. As his senses extend across every coin in Erebus' hoard, Mammon has become a [[mathematical]] genius, capable of instantly accounting his wealth and that of Hell.
>  Unknown to anyone but himself, Mammon is incomplete. In the centuries drifting in the Maelstrom after his first defeat, he lost a mighty gem, which he considers his heart, and he can only sense that it floats somewhere dark. He regularly sends servants to search for it but never reveals its true importance to his peers, lest he appears weak or vulnerable.


## History

>  According to the *[[Chronicle of the Righteous]]*, Mammon was once the [[Angel]] [[Empyreal lord]] of [[gems]] and [[silver]] before he betrayed [[Heaven]] and joined with [[Asmodeus]] in his Exodus into Hell.
>  During the Battle of the Triune Star, Mammon discovered the [[proteans]] and sought to turn them against Asmodeus' foes, but he was surprised by [[Sarenrae]] and her hosts. In the end, Mammon was cut down, his corpse falling upon the 13,001 gem-filled chests he brought to buy the proteans' aid and left to drift in the [[Maelstrom]].
>  Centuries after, agents of [[Mephistopheles]] retrieved Mammon and brought him back to Hell. Asmodeus had him brought to the vaults under [[Dis]], where the other archdevils laid him amid a vast trove. However, the fury of the Maelstrom and the power of Hell somehow combined to remake Mammon, who turned his burial treasure into his new body. Asmodeus, intrigued, supplied Mammon with wealth from [[Nessus]] and remade his crypt into Erebus, his new realm.


## Realm

>  Mammon's throne lies in a many-pillared vault filled with mirrors, crystal statues, and gem-encrusted floating bubbles. His ruined angelic body lies within [[Mammon's Bier]], a vault at the heart of Erebus.


## Religion

>  Both the greedy and the poor pray to Mammon for comforts like [[money]] or station. He usually answers by arranging for the supplicant to discover a 'lucky coin' from Erebus, through which he whispers to them to engage in increasingly [[Evil]] acts to get what they want.
>  Mammon's high priestess in the [[Inner Sea region]] is the centuries-old [[Isgeri]] noblewoman [[Lady Kaltessa Iyis]].
>  In the days of [[Thassilon]], Mammon was worshipped by a particularly successful cult, albeit one that was officially frowned upon while secretly being bolstered by the [[runelords]]. Indeed, in the city of [[Xin-Shalast]], a shrine to Mammon could be found on Temple Row.
>  Powerful cultists of Mammon create alluring suits of [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor]] known as *nightskins*.
