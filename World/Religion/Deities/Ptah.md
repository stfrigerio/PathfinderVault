> **Ptah** is a member of the [[Osirian pantheon|pantheon]] often worshiped in [[Ancient Osirion]]. Ptah is a creator [[Deity|deity]] so powerful that he is the only god to create himself, though he and Ra are both venerated as creator gods.

> Osirion [[Dwarves|dwarves]] that worship Ptah instead depict him as a naked, deformed dwarf.
