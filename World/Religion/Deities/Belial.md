> The [[Archdevil|archdevil]] **Belial** (pronounced bee-LIE-uhl), also sometimes going by the aliases **Belhor**, **Jouvart**, and **Mechembuchus**, rules over their layer of [[Hell]]: the burning forges of [[Phlegethon]]. Their [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a horned, red-and-white-split mask of comedy and tragedy. Their areas of interest include adultery and desire.

## Appearance

> Asmodeus granted Belial an unlimited malleability of form, their true natural form unknown to all but Asmodeus. They freely shift form, species, and gender when engaging with [[Mortal|mortal]] and [[Immortal|immortal]] lovers across the [[Universe|universe]], enabling them to become whatever and whomever might be most alluring to their lovers, leaving innumerable [[Half-fiend|half-fiends]] of every description in their wake.
> Among the other archdevils, Belial typically appears as a delicately built [[Humanoid|humanoid]] between five and six feet tall with pale skin and hair but burning eyes, with one half of their body shining and [[Angel|angelic]] and the other as scarred, misshapen, and grotesque as the most hideous [[Malebranche|malebranche]].


## History

> Before the Exodus, [[Asmodeus]] desired to create the most beautiful and perfect being in existence. Knowing that no individual could be everything to all creatures, he gave his creation complete malleability of form and a body that shifted in response to the deepest desires of anyone who looked upon it. The result was horrifying and insane, a monstrous thing of heaving flesh, golden hair, and luminous eruptions, which Asmodeus has kept locked away ever since. He tried again, and instead of subjective transformation, he gave his creation control over its own shape. Asmodeus also bestowed upon it eloquent and persuasive speech, so that his creation might garner what those around it found most appealing and then become what they desired most. Asmodeus was content with this iteration and bestowed upon it the name Belial.


## Religion

> Scorned lovers, the forlorn, and both the unattractive and the alluring worship Belial. The disfigured beseech them for the comforts of the flesh, while aging beauties offer the youth of others to restore or maintain their own. The Pale Kiss is greatly pleased with offerings given during carnal acts and of bodily fluid stolen from unwilling lovers.
