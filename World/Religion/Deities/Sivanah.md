> **Sivanah** (pronounced siv-AHN-ah) is the patron [[God|goddess]] of [[Illusion|illusion]] [[Magic|magic]], tricksters, and those who keep secrets. She is also known as the "Seventh Veil", a name taken from the clothing she is most often depicted wearing. Her [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] is a circle made of six dull-colored veils tied end-to-end.

## Appearance

> Sivanah's true form is disguised behind her seven veils, each of which is tied to a race: ([[Human|human]], [[Elf|elf]], [[Halfling|halfling]], [[Gnome|gnome]], [[Aranea|aranea]], and [[Naga|naga]]). Her true form is said to be that of a member of a seventh, unknown race, but she always appears as female. She can appear as any of these races while wearing the appropriate veil.


## Dogma

> Sivanah's ultimate goals are only known to the goddess. This concealment might be a reason why her faith has not grown more.


## Providence

> The goddess communicates with her faithful through mirrors, reflections in water, and sometimes even through their own shadows.


## Realm

> The goddess makes her home in the most unlikely of places: the [[Maelstrom]]. Sivanah's Realm is extremely difficult to find, appearing in no fixed place, yet can always be recognized by its abundance of mirrored surfaces.  Sivanah protects her realm in this way from the native [[Protean|proteans]], who bear her much ill will. The exact origin behind this conflict is not known, although there are many speculations, including that Sivanah once stole something from them, or that she once was a [[Keketar|keketar]], risen [[Demon|demon]], or fallen [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azata]].


## Relationships

> Sivanah has a rivalry with [[Zon-Kuthon]] as she loathes the dark god’s corruption of shadows and sometime uses her influence to cause darkness to act unexpectedly for Zon-Kuthons clerics. Sivanah also has an incomprehensible interest in the false-god [[Razmir]]. Her followers, most often veiled [[Witch|witches]] from [[Irrisen]], are her most commonly utilised emissaries to Razmiran.


## Church of Sivanah

> The worship of Sivanah is popular in the countries of [[Nex]], [[Irrisen]], and in the cities of [[Katapesh]], while it is strictly prohibited in [[Nidal]], due to a ban by the country's [[Cleric|clerics]] of [[Zon-Kuthon]]. She is also widely worshiped among the [[Illusionist|illusionists]] and [[Gnome|gnomes]] of [[Golarion]], who appreciate her devotion to their favorite [[School of magic|school of magic]].  Devout illusionists who follow her have been known to be able to mimic [[Divine|divine]] [[Magic/Conjuration|healing magic]] by use of their shadow conjuration [[Spell|spells]].


## Holidays

> Worshipers of the goddess celebrate a general holiday called [[Seven Veils]], on either 7 or 23 [[Neth]], as one of their most sacred of days. What [[Ritual|rituals]] the church of Sivanah performs on this date, however, are unknown to outsiders, for the cult enjoys its secrets. This secrecy has, unsurprisingly, given rise to all manner of sinister rumours, yet when Seven Veils rolls around each year, its eager participants are quick to set aside rumour in preference for the night's fun and games. The festivities include comic performances, jokes, illusions, and multi-racial masquerade balls.
