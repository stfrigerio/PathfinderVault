> The **Queens of the Night**, or their [[Mortal|mortal]]-given title of **whore queens**, are a group of four unique female [[Demigod|demigoddesses]] who have managed to distinguish themselves despite [[Asmodeus]] unvarnished misogyny. Usually referred to by their pejorative collective name, their worshippers prefer to use **Angels of Vengeance** or **Queens of Light** to describe these four demigoddesses.
> All but one, Mahathallah, are former [[Angel|angels]] who followed the Prince of Darkness, and fled the restrictive rules of [[Heaven]] eons ago, believing that they would become monarchs in their own realms. Instead they found a strict hierarchy that has little room at the top, and where they were forced to live as second-class nobles. Over time they learned to manipulate and scheme as well as the most devious of the Pit's denizens. Roughly equal in power and prestige to the [[Infernal duke|infernal dukes]], they have acquired a greater notoriety throughout the [[Great Beyond]], and their cults rival those of the [[Archdevil|archdevils]] and Asmodeus himself in size.
