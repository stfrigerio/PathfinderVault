> **Andoletta** (pronounced an-do-LET-ah), also known as **Grandmother Crow**, is one of the powerful [[Archon|archons]] known as an [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]]. She treats her flock as any grandmother would, protecting the innocent, reprimanding the wayward, and punishing the sinful. She is the current [[Steward Heaven|steward]] of [[Requius]], the fourth tier of [[Heaven]], gaining her the title of [[Shepherd Heaven|Shepherd]].



## Appearance

> Grandmother Crow stands 5 feet tall and has a stern, wrinkled face. She keeps her gray hair tucked into a bun. She wears a black cape of glossy crow feathers and walks with a willow walking stick.


## Home

> Andoletta is the Shepherd of Requius, the fourth tier of Heaven, where she lives in a cottage on the [[Field of Opsimathy]]. Along with [[Erastil]], she oversees the villages and cities of Requius, where [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] reside who have no interest in joining Heaven's ongoing crusades against the forces of [[Chaos|chaos]] and [[Evil|evil]] throughout the [[Great Beyond]].


## Church of Andoletta

> Devotees of Andoletta carry willow-wood walking sticks just like her. When they meet a fellow worshiper, they acknowledge one another by bowing low over the stick, with both hands holding it. They generally dress in simple, black clothing, and can be recognized by their intolerance of foolishness. Her [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] is a walking stick made of willow; the stick is held in a hand which wears a wristlet of crow feathers.
> She is known to be worshiped in the small town of [[Grayce]] in the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] province of [[Caliphas]], near the border with [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]].
> Common places to worship Grandmother Crow are courthouses, orphanages, and schools. Her most devout followers take time each day for a special rite: reciting the *Obeisance of Glorious Preservation* from memory while weaving a willow branch basket, filling the basket with food or money, and giving it to the poor.
> Creatures most often associated with Andoletta include [[Blink dog|blink dogs]], [[Celestial|celestial]] crows, [[Hound archon|hound archons]], [[Lantern archon|lantern archons]], and similarly-aligned [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]].
