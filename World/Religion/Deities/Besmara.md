 A Besmaran priestess.
> **Besmara** (pronounced bes-MAR-uh), also known as the **Pirate Queen**, is a goddess most commonly worshiped by the sailor-folk of the [[Shackles]] or [[Ilizmagorti]]. She is said to captain her legendary ship *[[Seawraith]]* throughout the seas and waterways of the [[Great Beyond]] (especially the [[Maelstrom]]), making raids on places such as [[Hell]], [[Elysium]], [[Axis]], and [[Heaven]]. Pirates don't tend to be a very religious lot, and generally only call on her on their death bed or if in extreme danger. Those few [[Cleric|priests]] who do devote themselves to her generally also are captains of their own raiding ships and have a fierce reputation. Her symbol is the jolly roger, a universal emblem of piracy, normally a white skull and crossbones on a black field.
