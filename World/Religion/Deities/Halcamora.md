> **Halcamora** is an [[Agathion|agathion]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] who watches over gardens, parks, and [[Alcoholic beverages|wineries]].



## Home

> Halcamora resides in a leafy bower deep within the Forest of Whispered Longing in [[Nirvana]]. She is a social empyreal lord and often visits the palaces of others.


## Appearance

> Halcamora appears as a friendly, smiling young woman with tanned skin, sleek black hair, and pale green eyes. Her brown robes are kilted up to her knees, and her feet are always dirty with [[Wine|wine]] stains. Two ladybug wings emerge from her shoulders, and two slender black antennae curve up from her temples.


## Relationships

> Halcamora is the daughter of [[Erastil]] and [[Jaidi]] and the sister of [[Cernunnos]]. She despises insect-bodied [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]] who blight crops and spread [[Diseases of Golarion|epidemics]].


## Cults

> Halcamora is worshipped by gardeners and vintners, particularly in lean times. Peaceful farming communities often build small shrines dedicated to her in addition to temples for more powerful [[Deity|deities]] of nature.
