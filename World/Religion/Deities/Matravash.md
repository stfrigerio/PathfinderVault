> **Matravash**, or **Matravashii**, is the [[Vudran pantheon|Vudran]] [[Demigod|demigoddess]] of the [[Matra River]]. As the river connects communities, Matravash is seen as a facilitator of civilisation, and the Matra's passage into the [[Obari Ocean]] is symbolic of Matravash's faithful passing into the [[Great Beyond]].



## History

> According to the *Azvadeva Pujila*, the entire Matra River was once filled with treacherous rapids until Matravash was enchanted by the beauty of lotus blossoms in sheltered eddies and calmed herself to accommodate them. In doing so, she found the visitors now able to travel the calmed waters welcome, and since then, both Matravash and the lotuses have earned a reputation of being calm, peaceful, and contemplative.


## Home

> Matravash closely tends to those who dwell near the Matra River and have grown accustomed to seasonal flooding, engineering 'coincidences' that keep them safe. In settlements, she enriches the soil of the river delta without disrupting people's lives. As such, floods are seen as a gift associated with fertility instead of natural disasters or a goddess' wrath.


## Relationships

> After saving Matravash from the [[Asura rana|asura rana]] [[Gavidya]] the Numberless, the goddess of canyons [[Ashukharma]] took Matravash as her lover, which locals of [[Radripal]] claim formed the natural Archwalk bridge that joins the city's two halves. Matravash's followers also revere Ashukharma, even where the river does not flow through canyons.


## Church of Matravash

> Matravash is seen as a friend of the oppressed, who can find an escape route from their current home to better places via the Matra. As long as these refugees have broken no laws, her priests refuse to reveal their whereabouts.
