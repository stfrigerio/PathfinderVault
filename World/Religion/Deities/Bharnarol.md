> **Bharnarol** is a powerful [[Agathion|agathion]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]]. He may intervene when an inventor is creating something dangerous. While he prefers to convince them to change or abandon the invention, he will use force to steal away the item if necessary. Such items are stored in the [[Unflawed Vault]] underneath his workshop, which is located in the foothills of the Dragonmane Mountains in [[Nirvana]]. His forge is underneath these mountains in the [[Caverns of Molten Sunlight]].


## Appearance

> The **Tempered Inventor** has the head of an elephant, including silver skin and tusks. His arms are heavily muscled for working his forge and garden of miniature trees.


## Church

> Bharnarol's holy symbol is two [[Potion|potion]] flasks being tipped to mix the contents. His worshipers use factories, libraries, studios, and workshops as places of worship. His favored minions are [[Animated object|animated objects]], [[Golem|golems]], and celestial [[Gorgon|gorgons]]. His fervent followers meditate on his teachings while making the motions of their favorite crafting method; they proceed to follow through with any creative thoughts that result.
