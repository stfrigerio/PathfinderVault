> **Onos** is the [[Deity|god]] of the [[Element|elements]], embassies, and [[Plane|extraplanar]] travel worshiped by the inhabitants of ancient [[Azlant]]. As a god of [[Portal|portals]], Onos promotes [[Planar travel|planar travel]] as a means to experience and discover what other [[Plane|planes]], and especially the planes of the [[Inner Sphere]], have to offer.



## Appearance and emissaries

> Onos behaves like an animated force without a distinct personality that always speaks directly and to the point, without symbolism.


## Relationships

> In the late [[Age of Legend]], Onos' faith started overlapping with that of [[Gozreh]]. It was believed that the church of Onos better understood and controlled the elements, especially those that are not concerned with air and water.


## Church of Onos

> Onos has never been particularly widely worshipped on [[Golarion]], even during the height of Azlant. Today, Onos is almost forgotten on Golarion but its worship is still popular in the Inner Planes.


### Worshipers and clergy

> Priests of Onos are calm people, not quick to anger, and often serve as mediators.


### Temples and shrines

> Many of the empire's outposts hosted temples and shrines to Onos. Its largest temples can be found in planar settlements like the [[City of Brass]], where they host extraplanar visitors.
