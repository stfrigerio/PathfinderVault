> **Thamir** is the [[Halfling|halfling]] [[Deity|god]] of greed and opportunity and is mostly revered by cutpurses, [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|assassins]], and mistreated halflings. His last name always changes to match the last name of the [[Primarch]] of [[Absalom]]; for example, during the tenure of [[Gyr of House Gixx]], his full name was **Thamir Gixx**. Halflings often associate him with [[Norgorber]], be it as a friend, minion, or [[Slave|slave]]. A black [[Dagger|dagger]] with a white circle on the blade is Thamir's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]].
> Angry or brutalised halflings sometimes turn to the worship of Thamir, seeing him as representative of the dark side of halfling nature. Stories tell of worshipers who lay [[Trap|traps]], tricks, and [[Poison|poisons]] on the residents of their home, always to the ultimate benefit of the halfling of course. Worshipers might also offer prayers to Norgorber as well, though never the other way around.

## Home

> Thamir's realm, called the Back Alleys, is only accessible through hidden alleys within [[Duskfathom]] underneath [[Axis]]. Its layout changes on an hourly basis, and only those with Thamir's permission can reach his seat of power.


## Appearance

> Thamir appears as a black-clad, sinister halfling clad in shadows, usually with his dagger ready to strike. His facial features vary from region to region: in [[Cheliax]], he has pale skin and a dark goatee; while in [[Absalom]], his depictions feature olive skin, icy blue eyes, and no facial hair. These similarities encourage disaffected halflings to feel a close, personal connection with Thamir.


## Relationships

> The nature of the relationship between Thamir and Norgorber is a controversial topic. The most common assumption is that Norgorber is Thamir's superior, since most of the latter's followers pay homage to the former but not vice versa. Since Thamir's faith appeared shortly after Norgorber's [[Ascension|ascension]], it is implied that Norgorber raised Thamir to godhood to repay an old debt or for a future favour. Some halflings instead believe that Thamir is as old as their species, aided Norgorber in the [[Test of the Starstone]], and only subsequently revealed his true nature. Thamir's worshippers are usually accommodating to Norgorber's, but Norgorberites are wary of Thamir's followers, viewing them as too eager to resort to murder, even when it would be detrimental.
> Among his fellow halfling deities Thamir is seen as the black sheep of the family. [[Chaldira]] in particular considers him her chief foe.
