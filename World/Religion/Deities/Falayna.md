> **Falayna** is a powerful [[Archon|archon]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] and patron of femininity and martial training, believing them to be complementary instead of exclusive.



## History

> Millennia ago, Falayna's portfolio only encompassed femininity, and she was the lover of another empyreal lord, whose name has been lost, who was master of strength of arms. After he fell in battle against followers of [[Moloch]], Falayna's recovery of her lover's [[Sword|sword]] led her from being an empyreal lord solely focused on femininity towards her role as paragon of martial training.


## Home

> Falayna spends much of her time training her followers in the [[Half-Empty Palace]] on [[Illumis]], the fifth tier of [[Heaven]].


## Appearance

> Falayna can take many forms: most often, that of a beautiful, fair-skinned woman with glossy brown hair and blue eyes. She wears a [[Silver|silver]] [[Nethys/Equipment/Armors/Breastplate|breastplate]] under [[Silk|silk]] robes and numerous [[Ring|rings]] of all colours on her fingers; she is never seen without her [[Sword|sword]] *Betrothal*.


## Cults

> Falayna is worshipped by warriors, [[Jewel|jewellers]], and squires in training. Her worshippers are of both sexes, with women making the majority; they include brides and girls on the cusp of growing up.


## On Golarion

> Falayna has a following among the Mishyrians of the [[Padishah Empire of Kelesh]]. Mishyrians came to worship Falayna after they split off from their Beshzen compatriots, who began worshiping Moloch after their cities were destroyed by a [[Spawn of Rovagug]].
> There is a temple dedicated to Falayna in the town of [[Khoka]] on Qadira's eastern border.
