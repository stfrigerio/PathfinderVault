> **Andirifkhu** (pronounced an-de-RIF-ku) is the patron [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of [[Marilith|marilith]] [[Demon|demons]], sadistic inventors, and those who inflict pain for pay or sport. As well as patron, some say that the Razor Princess was indeed the first marilith; if this were the case, then Andirifkhu is also the most powerful marilith in existence.



## Home

> Andirifkhu rules the [[Vault of Ten Thousand Deaths]], a realm located on the [[Abyss]]. The Vault is a continent-sized maze filled with sadistic traps designed to kill and maim. It is rumoured to have links to death-trap dungeons across the [[Multiverse]], its taint creating death-filled labyrinths wherever the Vault of Ten Thousand Deaths is able to corrupt the planar matter of another plane.


## Appearance

> Andirifkhu appears as a tall, beautiful [[Humanoid|humanoid]] woman with six arms, covered head to toe in green scales. She has the eyes of a predatory [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake]] and long, crimson hair which can both slice through flesh and be rapidly fashioned into complicated [[Trap|traps]]. In each of her six hands, she wields a different razor-sharp blade, though her cultists believe she favors the [[Kukri|kukri]].


## Cult and worshippers

> On the [[Material Plane]], she is worshipped by a wide variety of sadists, [[Dero|dero]], [[Gremlin|gremlins]], and [[Drow|drow]]. In particular, she is the demonic patron of the drow nobles of [[House Dolour]] who act as sadistic trackers and bounty hunters. Worshippers are also found in some of the sadistic nobles of both [[Galt]] and those of the northern reaches of [[Taldor]]. Her worshippers favour an incredibly cruel method of sacrifice, they create trap-laden dungeons filled with deadly knife traps and flensing blades then release their sacrifices into the dungeon to die on the blades of one of the numerous traps. Those few who make it through the maze are crippled then put back at the start of the maze, the process is endlessly repeated until they eventually succumb.
