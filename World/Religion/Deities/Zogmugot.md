> The particularly ugly, female Zogmugot is one of the four deities collectively known as the [[Goblin hero-gods|goblin hero-gods]].
> It is said that Zogmugot looks out of every piece of beach glass with her baleful, colorful eyes, and can see what those who come down to the beach are up to and if she is not happy, she'll trick them out into the riptide by having a nice bit of something shiny floating on the waves to lure them out. She is the one who chooses if a goblin who falls into the sea drowns or washes back up on shore. It is also believed that worshipers are rewarded for their piety with prime pieces of trash, which wash up on their beach. Many of her minion goblins drown due to her obsession.


## Home
