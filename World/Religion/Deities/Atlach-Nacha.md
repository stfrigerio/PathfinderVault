> **Atlach-Nacha** is the [[Great Old One]] of construction, futility, and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spiders]]. In many aspects, it is dualistic: it is both and neither male or female, it constantly builds but its creations always fail, and it embodies both the spider's alien form and the recognisable shape of a [[Human|human]].



## Home

> Atlach-Nacha dwells in a nation-sized underground canyon connected to the underground of [[Leng]], where it weaves an impossibly complex web to connect all of the chasm's sides. It is said that the completion of Atlach-Nacha's web will either usher in an age of [[Insanity|insanity]] or allow the [[Outer God]] [[Abhoth]] to leave its own cavern, instead of having to send only spawn.


## Appearance

> Atlach-Nacha resembles an [[Elephant|elephant]]-sized, black-and-red spider with long spindly legs, a disturbingly [[Humanoid|humanoid]] face and hair-rimmed eyes. It has also been depicted as a female [[Drider|drider]] with multiple long arms.


## Cults

> Followers of Atlach-Nacha venerate the form of the spider, and view both the acts of building and deliberately allowing something to fail to be sacred, and oscillate between both of these urges. Atlach-Nacha's temples are often spider-infested caverns or ruins. Many of its worshippers are spiders themselves like driders, [[Ettercap|ettercaps]], [[Leng spider|Leng spiders]], and [[Bestiary/Jorogumo|jorogumos]]. When they infiltrate human society, jorogumos sometimes take Atlach-Nacha's name for some unclear reason.
