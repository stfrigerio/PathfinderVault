> **Deskari** (pronounced des-KAR-ee) was the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of infestation and locusts who was killed by [[Adventurer|adventurers]] in [[4718 AR]] at the conclusion of the [[Fifth Mendevian Crusade]].



## Appearance

> Deskari appeared as a horrible beast, [[Human|human]] from the waist up, and locust-like below. Semi-solid wings—composed of clouds of locusts—protruded from his human back, and he carried the terrible scythe *[[Riftcarver]]* in his fleshy hands.


## Unholy symbol

> Deskari's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] was a pair of crossed locust wings dripping with blood.


## History

> Deskari was the son of [[Pazuzu]] and an unnamed giant insect [[Demon|demon]]. He was born fully formed when Pazuzu breathed his first breath on the [[Material Plane]]. In his early years, Deskari lived in [[High M'Vania|High MVania]], sheltered by his father, until he developed his own cult on the Material Plane and seized his own [[Abyssal realm]], becoming a demon lord.
> Deskari had been interested in the barbarian nation of [[Sarkoris]] since he discovered the strange thinness of the [[Plane|planar]] barrier between it and his own realm. His cult grew and built many secret temples in the [[Northmounds]], and few Sarkorians realised that they were worshipping anything different from the numerous other religions in the country. Deskari's avatar and his followers were driven into the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]] by the god [[Aroden]] in one of his many miraculous deeds in [[4433 AR]].
> In [[4600 AR]], the [[Witch|witch]] [[Areelu Vorlesh]], having discovered the same thinness between Sarkoris and Deskari's realm, pledged her loyalty to him. In [[4606 AR]], emboldened by Aroden's death and the coming of the [[Age of Lost Omens]], Deskari opened the [[Worldwound]], laying waste to central Sarkoris.
> In [[4714 AR]], after spending a century killing and terrorising the people of Sarkoris and [[Mendev]] in the Worldwound, Deskari began his plan to expand the Worldwound to encompass the rest of [[Golarion]]. His plan was stopped by a small band of heroes who closed the Worldwound and destroyed Deskari for good.


## Relationships

 Deskari in action wielding *Riftcarver*.
> Being a child of two demons, Deskari disdained the other demon lords who originated as [[Mortality|mortals]], and respected those that predated mortal sin, or those that were once [[Qlippoth lord|qlippoth lords]].


### Baphomet

> Deskari was allied with his fellow demon lord [[Baphomet]] and their followers worked effectively together in the Worldwound on Golarion.


### Izyagna

> Deskari maintained a rivalry with the [[Nascent demon lord|nascent demon lord]] [[Izyagna]], presumably associated with their insect-oriented portfolios. As Izyagna serves [[Lamashtu]], this rivalry never escalated due to Deskari's reluctance to invoke the wrath of the Mother of Monsters.


### Pazuzu

> The Abyssal mating of Pazuzu with a giant demon resembling an insect resulted in the 'hatching' of Deskari; Pazuzu is thus considered the 'father' of Deskari. Under the protection of his father, Deskari rose in power within the Abyss eventually attaining full demon lord status himself. Deskari admired Pazuzu and they maintained cordial relations with each other. Although Deskari and Pazuzu were similar in levels of power, Deskari maintained a modicum of subservience to his father and Deskari's success brought credit to Pazuzu. Deskari's mother's name is unknown and she clearly was destroyed at some point as Deskari created his brutal scythe, *Riftcarver*, from her remains.


## Cult & worshipers

> Deskari's cult was most powerful in the lands that once made up the realm of Sarkoris. Outside of the Worldwound, his cults spread into other northern nations infecting the nearby lands of [[Mendev]], [[Numeria]], and [[Brevoy]], where they pretended to be devotees of [[Calistria]].
> Many of Deskari's cultists worshipped him in the hope of being rewarded when he was to rule over the world, but Deskari saw them as no more than pawns. The smart cultists that realised this, grafted demonic flesh onto themselves or sold their [[Soul|souls]] so they would become demons after death.


### Religious text

> Deskari's unholy text was *One Thousand Voices in My Flesh*, the first-person account of a [[Human|human]] priest who was infested with Deskari's eggs and heard his many voices until he committed suicide.


> There is a major article about Deskari in *[[City of Locusts]]* plus a Bestiary article.
