>  **Sicva** is a [[goddess]] of domination, invasive species, and oppression worshiped by the [[humans]] of [[ancient Azlant]]. She champions the corruption of [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good]] ideals into oppression and tasks her followers with spreading invasive species to damage indigenous ecosystems.


## Relationships

>  Despite the efforts of her parents [[Elion]] and [[Myr]] to raise her, Sicva resents them for their [[chaotic]] and good natures, respectively. Sicva's dogma was enticing to some of [[Lissala's]] followers, who sometimes worked alongside Sicva's, as both goddesses recognised the importance of duty and structure.


## Church of Sicva

>  Sicva's faith was popular among brutal, power-hungry politicians of Azlant, whose formal dress resemble military uniforms in various shades of grey. However, most of her followers were ordinary citizens swept up in the pageantry of her services. In the modern age, Sicva's cult has a minimal presence on [[Golarion]].
