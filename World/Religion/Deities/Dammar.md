> **Dammar** is an agender [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp usher]] and a physical manifestation of the first resurrection [[Magic|magic]] who monitors returns from the dead, ensuring that they are sufficiently difficult and infrequent. Dammar is also the patron of [[Medicine|medicine]] and [[Alcoholic beverages|alcohol]], and is said to have been the inventor of the hangover.


## Appearance

> Dammar is a portly, androgynous figure clad in many-layered [[Silk|silk]] robes and a veil that hides their face. Dammar has six insectile legs and no arms, but can manifest dozens of pseudopods at a time to multitask. For this reason, Dammar is also unofficially called the patron of creeping things.


## On Golarion

> Dammar was worshipped by the founders of the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] town of [[Thrushmoor]].
