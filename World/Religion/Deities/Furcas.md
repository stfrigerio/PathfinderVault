> **Furcas** is an [[Infernal duke|infernal duke]] said to know the secrets of fire and [[Herbalism|herbalism]], both to create and destroy. A true [[Knight|knight]] of [[Hell]], he is one of the greatest military commanders in the [[Great Beyond]] and sage of all things green and growing, and knows that a relentless will can, after aeons, turn the most delicate petal into a deadly [[Weapon|weapon]].



## Home

> Furcas' demesne is the [[Hanging Marches]], which lies on Hell's first layer, [[Avernus]]. His citadel, the [[Forked Pyre]], straddles a cataract of lava and guards the [[Hellmouth|hellmouth]] Voulgaz, the most frequently traveled route into the next layer, [[Dis]]. For aeons, Furcas has overseen his legions as they conduct people to Dis, and has defended it from countless [[Celestial|celestial]] and [[Protean|protean]] incursions.


## Appearance

> Furcas looks like a giant [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaur]] whose body is covered in dark '[[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]]' made of parasitic cassytha-like growths home to countless [[Toxic|toxic]] [[Plant|plants]]. His brow is crowned by laurels. The now deceased [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Typhon]] presented Furcas with a [[Trident|trident]] called the *[[Avernus Claw]]* that now serves as the infernal duke's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]].


## Relationships

> As his domain lies within Avernus, Furcas is a servant of its ruler [[Barbatos]]. His loyalty to Barbatos grants him special prestige in the archdevil's service. He also maintains strong ties with Dis and its ruler [[Dispater]].


## Cults

> Furcas is usually worshipped by [[Evil|evil]] knights, [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]], centaurs, and [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]]. [[Green dragon|Green dragons]], [[Graveknight|graveknights]], and [[Green Faith|nature worshippers]] seeking ancient secrets occasionally ally with him. They conduct worship in castles and temples reclaimed by nature, preferably overgrown by forests or buried in [[Volcano|volcanic]] ash. Victims are sacrificed to Furcas in a rite which involves a fast-growing plant pushing through them over several days.
> Furcas' preferred [[Devil|devils]] are [[Levaloch|levalochs]], and he is also served by creatures infused by [[Hellfire|hellfire]] and [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] plants.


> [[Paizo]] published a major article about Furcas in *[[Hell Unleashed]]* 38*ff.*
