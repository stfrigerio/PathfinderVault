*See also: [[Cult of the Child-Goddess]]*
> The **child-goddess** is the object of veneration for the [[Cult of the Child-Goddess]], which is located in the [[Ankar-Te]] district of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]]. It is not known whether the child-goddess is an actual [[Deity|deity]], a hoax used to generate income for the cult, or something more innocuous, though at least [[Shamalay Kasan|one of her followers]] draws [[Divine magic|divine magic]] through faith in her.
> The child-goddess (or -goddesses, as the exact number is not known) dwells within the [[Palace of the Child-Goddess]], a flat-topped pyramid with a single, massive door. From here, metal, windowless palanquins are carried throughout the district by carriers. Each palanquin is a metal box six feet long and four feet high and carried by [[Zombie|zombie]] servants or half-naked, oiled male [[Slave|slaves]]. Judging from their dress, the cult is believed to have originated in distant [[Vudra]]. Followers approach these processions and drop coins in the tithe-bags attached to the palanquins.
> In Kaer Maga—the only known place in the [[Inner Sea region]] where the cult is active—the faithful are led by the [[Shamalay Kasan|High Priestess Shamalay Kasan]], a [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]] woman who is also one of the most powerful figures in the district of Ankar-Te, if not the entire city.
