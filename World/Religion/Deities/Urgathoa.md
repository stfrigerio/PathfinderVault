> **Urgathoa** (pronounced oor-gah-THO-ah) is the [[Varisian]] [[Goddess|goddess]] of physical excess, [[Diseases of Golarion|disease]], and the [[Undead|undead]]. She is mostly worshiped by dark [[Necromancer|necromancers]], the [[Undead|undead]], and those wishing to become undead. Sometimes those who live gluttonous lifestyles make supplication to her, as do those suffering from a serious illness.



## History

> There are stories that suggest that Urgathoa was once a hedonistic [[Mortal|mortal]] woman. Upon her death, she fled [[Pharasma|Pharasmas]] [[Boneyard]] and returned to [[Golarion]], making her the [[Great Beyond|Great Beyonds]] first undead creature. Her return to the mortal world is said to be the origin of disease.


## Home

> Urgathoa's divine realm is Bloodrot, a necropolis located on the shore of the Sea of Lamentation in [[Abaddon]] inhabited by her undead followers. She originally received this realm in a deal with [[Charon]], and the [[Daemon|daemons]] largely leave her alone.


## Relationships

> Among her enemies are [[Erastil]], [[Sarenrae]], [[Pharasma]], [[Gozreh]], and their followers. She also comes into conflict with [[Abadar]] and [[Calistria]]. Calistria, in particular, is more of a friendly rival than an enemy, as she represents lust while Urgathoa champions carnal excess, and the two often fight over potential followers. She also hates followers of the [[Prophecies of Kalistrade]], as their strict sexual and dietary restrictions go counter to her hedonism and gluttony; and she is annoyed by [[Irori|Iroris]] discipline and moderation. She has recently come into conflict with [[Gorum]], who wants his worshippers to die in battle and considers death by disease humiliating. Since her undead followers can quickly spread across the living world, [[Lamashtu]] sees Urgathoa as a rival.
> [[Zyphus]], who keeps his divine realm inside hers, is loyal to Urgathoa and shares many interests with her. Due to their shared stance that love endures beyond death, Urgathoa has been trying to recruit [[Naderi]], which in turn puts her at odds with Naderi's former mistress [[Shelyn]]. Urgathoa has been known to ally with the [[Four Horsemen]] from time to time, as many of their objectives are the same. She is also considered an ally of the followers of the [[Whispering Way]]. Her relationship with the [[Demon lord|demon lords]] [[Kabriri]] and [[Zura]], patrons of [[Ghoul|ghouls]] and [[Vampire|vampires]], are inconsistent. Cults of [[Groetus]] often cooperate with cults of Urgathoa who share their hedonism, but the nihilistic Groetans scoff at an eternal existence as undead.


## Appearance

![[Urgathoa.jpg|left+hmed]] 
 A depiction of Urgathoa.
> Urgathoa is generally depicted as an attractive, pale-skinned, and ebony-haired woman. Unlike mortal women, her flesh begins to rot and wither away at her waist, leaving her as little more than a blood-soaked skeleton from the hips down. She is often similarly manifested, but wearing a loose fitting gown stained with black, brown, and red splotches.


## Servants

> Urgathoa's minions include powerful [[Vampire|vampires]], [[World/Items & Equipment/Wondrous Items/Lich|liches]], and other intelligent, authoritative undead. Some female [[Cleric|clerics]] of Urgathoa are transformed after death into undead creatures known as the [[Daughter of Urgathoa|daughters of Urgathoa]]. One of the most famous of these terrifying creatures is [[Illcayna Alonnor]], who leads an army of [[Wight|wights]] in the ruined [[Isger|Isgeri]] town of [[Finder's Gulch|Finders Gulch]]. Her [[Divine servitor|divine servitor race]] are the [[Sarcovalt|sarcovalt]], disgusting fly-like creatures that roam her realm feeding on the remains of devoured souls.


### Unique servants


#### Barasthangas

> This servant of Urgathoa is a [[Devourer|devourer]], a powerful, extremely emaciated-looking undead. Her white skin is so thin and tight that the creature's bones and connective tissue can be seen through it. She can occasionally be called on by powerful [[Magic|magic]] to perform tasks, but requires the [[Soul|soul]] of an important creature in return.


#### Fjarn

> Once a [[Linnorm King]], [[Fjarn]] is now a burly corpse-grey undead in the service of the Pallid Princess.


#### Mother's Maw

> [[Mother's Maw|Mothers Maw]], a gigantic, fanged, and flying skull, is her [[Herald|herald]].


#### Olix

> This minion is a [[Vampire|vampiric]] priest that possesses strong shadow powers.


## Church of Urgathoa

 
 Followers of Urgathoa often spread disease.
> The churches of Urgathoa are dispersed across Golarion in cell-based cults, with individual groups rarely working together. Activities are usually done under the cover of night, except in lands such as [[Geb]], where she is worshiped quite openly. She is most often followed in the the [[Darklands]], [[Osirion]], [[Ustalav]], and [[Varisia]], and among twisted [[Garundi human ethnicity|Garundi]] and [[Varisian|Varisians]] throughout the [[Inner Sea region]]. Urgathoa is one of the [[Three Feasters]], the deities worshipped by the [[Koboto]] tribe of the [[Sodden Lands]].


### Obedience

> Certain dedicated worshipers of the Pallid Princess perform daily [[Obedience|obediences]] in order to receive [[Divine magic|divine]] blessings known as a [[Boon|boons]] from their goddess. The obedience takes the form of a ritual in which the worshiper spreads the most sumptuous feast she can find on a flat surface covered with a black velvet cloth. While consuming the food, the penitent must drink wine and say prayers to Urgathoa until she is painfully full. After a full hour of this, the worshiper must consume a piece of rotten or rancid food, trusting in the goddess to protect her from any illness that might follow. If the ritual is performed correctly and the goddess approves, the worshiper's ability to cast [[Necromancy|necromantic]] spells is increased for the day.


### Clergy

> Urgathoa's priests are primarily composed of clerics and necromancers. They have few responsibilities to uphold, other than helping those who desire undeath, and protection of their own. Understandably, they often are secretive of their religious inclinations in public. The priests have been known to compel their enemies to eat their own fallen comrades.
> The ceremonial clothes of Urgathoa's worshipers are a loose, floor-length, gray tunic, with a bone-white or dark gray cape clasped at the front. The lower half of the tunic is usually shredded, alluding to the goddess' own physical decay. Most ceremonies involve consuming great amounts of food and drink, which means that most raiments are covered by numerous stains.


### Church Structure

> The church is organized as a matriarchy, with a powerful cleric, usually female, at the head of each temple; if the priestess is a daughter of Urgathoa, the entire temple is considered especially blessed. Priests who can create undead, either through magic or through the passing of their undead taint, are called Necro-Lords, and receive extra privileges.
> Congregants are divided into two castes. The higher caste is known as the ghula, which consists of privileged members who may or may not be members of the priesthood. They are served by the famished: initiate members attempting to prove themselves worthy of recognition by the church. Rank inside the congregation may sometimes be an inversion of rank outside it, and if one of the famished is of higher social status outside the church than a ghula, the ghula treats the famished respectfully in public to preserve the church's secrecy. Like most [[Evil|evil]] cults, the secret church is scattered and cell-based, and contact between congregations is infrequent.


#### Reaping

> Senior priests of Urgathoa sometimes practice a ritual known as the Reaping. The priest will put on a grey robe and arm himself with a [[Vorpal weapon|vorpal]] scythe. The priest then heads out into the world to cause as much death and destruction as he can before he is driven back to his sanctuary. They believe that if Urgathoa is pleased by the outcome of the Reaping, she will grant a boon to the priest.


### Antipaladins of Urgathoa

> [[Antipaladin|Antipaladins]] dedicated to Urgathoa are creatures of the night who bring disease and leave only death in their wake. They hope to emulate their patroness by hastening all to their unavoidable graves, and see undead as the ultimate expression of existence, as they have transcended both life and death. If not undead themselves, her antipaladins strive to emulate them and destroy all who oppose them. Unrepentant gluttons, they seek to feed their hunger and base desires whenever possible.


### Temples and shrines

> Urgathoa's temples are modeled after feast-halls, with a large table serving as an altar, surrounded by numerous chairs. Usually temples are near a graveyard or a crypt, frequently inhabited by [[Ghoul|ghouls]]. Her greatest temples are often guarded by [[Daemon|daemonic]] servants. Her largest temple in Geb, and it being a nation of undead, perhaps the largest in the world, is the [[Cathedral of Epiphenomena]] in the city of [[Mechitar]].


### Holy texts

> Urgathoa's sacred text is entitled *[[Serving Your Hunger]]*, and written by [[Dason]], her first antipaladin.


### Favored animals

> Gods are often associated with certain [[Animal|animals]], either because they possess a quality favored by the god, or because the god's faithful feel a special kinship to them. Urgathoa's favored animals include [[Moth|deaths-head moths]], flies and maggots, vultures and other carrion eaters.
