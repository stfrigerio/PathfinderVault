> The [[Demon lord|demon lord]] **Shax** (pronounced SHAX) revels in acts of sadistic torture, cruelty, and bloody murder.



## Background


### Unholy symbol

> Shax's unholy symbol features a pool of blood with a curved white feather in it.


## Home

> Shax is said to dwell in the [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Charnelhome]], which appears as a series of endless rooms each filled with horrific torture implements.


## Appearance

> Shax has a statuesque human torso and is always bedecked with knives, razors, and other bloody implements of torture. Shax's most abnormal feature is the dove's head that sits atop his muscular neck. Shax has the unnervingly dark emotionless eyes of a psychopath and has a blood-covered beak that he uses to eat the eyes of his still-living victims: a particularly favourite activity. Shax's legs are also bird-like,  giving him a strange hybrid appearance.


## Cult and worshipers

> Shax has no organised church thanks to the deranged nature of most of his worshipers: his cultists are generally lone, deranged killers or warmongers seeking luck and glory in their deeds. Some of these monstrous sadists are not insane loners, but the corrupted scions of decadent noble houses led through hedonism and cruelty to kidnap the poor and unfortunate and exact Shax's bloody will upon them. Notable cultists of Shax include the Marquis and Marquess Cosymnos, minor [[Taldan]] nobles. 
> In addition to lone, surface-dwelling psychopaths, Shax is also worshiped by the [[Drow|drow]] of [[House Vexidyre]] in the depths of the [[Darklands]] who serve as deadly controllers of [[Zirnakaynin|Zirnakaynins]] markets. He is also worshiped there by [[Choker|chokers]] and [[Dero|deros]]. The [[Marilith|marilith]] [[Varmirhias]], who dwells within [[Zirnakaynin]], is known as the "Daughter of Shax", but it is not clear if she is actually related to the [[Demon lord|demon lord]].
> Shax is worshiped by his creations, the [[Babau|babau]] [[Demon|demons]], whom he still creates. Shax makes particularly powerful ones by flaying still living victims before the final Abyssal transformation. He is also venerated by some [[Shadow demon|shadow demons]], and is served on [[Golarion]] by a band of them that controls a tribe of [[Kellid]] barbarians in [[Frostmire|Frostmires]] [[Sabertooth Vale]] in the [[Worldwound]].
> Some [[Mohrg|mohrgs]] that revel in torturing still-living victims choose to worship Shax instead of [[Urgathoa]].
