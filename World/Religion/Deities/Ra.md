> **Ra** is the ruler of the [[Deity|deities]] in the [[Osirian pantheon]] and the legendary king of [[Osirion]] during the [[Age of Creation]]. He represents the [[Sun|sun]] and fair, just, honourable rulership, and is credited by many Osirians to be their creator.



## Appearance

> Ra is a powerful [[Falcon|falcon]]-headed man with a sun disc blazing above his head.


## Home

> Ra travels on a great [[Barge|barge]] through the heavens.


## Relationships

 A Family Tree of the Osirian Pantheon.
> Ra is the father of [[Bastet]], [[Hathor]], [[Maat]] and [[Sekhmet]], and the creator of many other Osirian deities. [[Thoth]], his son-in-law, serves as his counsellor and secretary, and [[Wadjet]] supports him as the patron of kings.
> [[Apep]], the great [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|serpent]] who seeks to consume the sun, is Ra's arch-enemy whom he has to fight every night to protect the sun; he is often aided in this great battle by Bastet, [[Horus]], [[Selket]] and [[Sobek]]. Every sunrise is seen as evidence of Apep's defeat at Ra's hands, albeit a temporary one until the sun rises no more and everything ends.


## Cults

> Ra is worshipped by both [[Pharaoh|pharaohs]] and [[Paladin|paladins]] fighting against darkness as well as by [[Commoner|commoners]]. Obelisks representing petrified sunlight are always found in Ra's temples, which are open to the sky and where services are held in daylight.
