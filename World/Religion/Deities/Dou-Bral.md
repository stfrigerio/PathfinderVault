> **Dou-Bral** (pronounced due-BRAWL) was the son of the spirit-wolf [[Thron]], and half-brother of the goddess [[Shelyn]]. During those mythical times, Dou-Bral had friendly relations with the other deities, even aiding them in the imprisonment of [[Rovagug]] by erecting the legendary [[Star Tower|Star Towers]] to seal the Rough Beast in its prison.
> Together, the brother and sister shared the portfolio of beauty, [[Art|art]], love and [[Music|music]] but remained minor deities. After a conflict between the two of unknown origin, Dou-Bral left reality for the dark places between the planes: the [[Dark Tapestry]]. There he was possessed and corrupted by a powerful alien being which created him anew as the twisted and malevolent [[Zon-Kuthon]]. Upon his return to [[Golarion]], Shelyn attempted to bring Dou-Bral back into his body, but was unsuccessful.  It is believed that Dou-Bral still lives in some hidden prison in Zon-Kuthon's soul, but any attempts he has made to free himself have failed.
