>  **Thremyr** would still be asleep if he had not been awoken by the [[Starstone's]] fall. He appears as a colossal [[Frost giant]] made of ice, [[gems]], and salt. He creates [[ice trolls]], strange [[Fey]], or simple snow when walking and is particularly fond of treasure of all sorts. He is worshipped by [[frost giants]], who believe he is their creator. It is said that these giants were created when Thremyr fell into the [[Steaming Sea]] and parts of his form were carved off into large iceberg like shapes. At first he was incensed at the seemingly smaller copies of his form and chased them off. Later they returned and worshiped him, so he accepted them as his creations.
>  In addition to the frost giants, Thremyr is also believed to have created the [[winter wolves]]. These sentient canines say that once they were [[worgs]], but the touch of Thremyr's flesh imbued them with a mystic connection to cold and ice. He is also thought to have created the first [[ice trolls]] in much the same manner as the frost giants, as well as the icy beings known as the thremindyrs; according to legend, the first of these elemental creatures was born when Thremyr sighed, passing from his lips and into the world.


## Church of Thremyr

>  Thremyr cares little for worshipers, but respects the ancient rituals and devotional prayers directed toward him enough to impartially grant favors to those who practice them.
