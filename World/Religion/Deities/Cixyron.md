> **Cixyron** is a [[Harbinger|harbinger]] (a [[Daemon|daemonic]] [[Demigod|demigod]] from [[Abaddon]] who can grant [[Divine magic|divine magic]]) who resembles a [[Metal|metallic]], [[Raven|raven]]-headed skeleton crackling with electricity.


## Followers

> Some of Cixyron's followers mastered ways to harvest and absorb matter of [[Abaddon]] itself, and further learned to infuse it into [[Firearm|firearm]] ammunition. Such followers are known as [[Planar rifter|planar rifters]], although the practices and methods have also spread to others who do not share the same daemonic faith.
> In [[Golarion]], many of Cixyron's followers prowl the [[Mana Wastes]] for advanced weaponry, scouring the blasted land in servitude of their master. They occasionally attack inventors in [[Alkenstar]] and [[Dongun Hold]] to acquire these weapons. They also favour the use of deadly poison, viewing it as an homage to the harbinger’s domain over poisonous metals.
