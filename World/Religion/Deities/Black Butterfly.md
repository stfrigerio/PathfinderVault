> **Black Butterfly** is a powerful [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azata]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]]. She never acts rashly and believes in the wisdom of the cosmos to guide her. She teaches that in the silence between breaths and thoughts, one's true nature can be seen.



## History

> According to legend, the Black Butterfly was conjured by [[Desna]] accidentally: as Desna placed the [[Star|stars]] in the sky she made a [[Constellation|pattern]] that, upon completion, manifested itself as the Black Butterfly.


## Homes

> The Black Butterfly hides in the dark spaces of the [[Stair of Stars]], which leads to [[Cynosure]], Desna's palace. Her realm is a quiet void, with breathable air for all creatures and pockets of solid shadows for those that want their feet grounded. It is very difficult to find and not even scholars can agree on its exact location, though desperate travellers sometimes make their way there and enjoy momentary succour.
> The Black Butterfly keeps a secondary, small realm within Cynosure itself, where her [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] live.


## Appearance

> The Silence Between looks like the silhouette of a woman that also has white hair and eyes. Her wings contain images of [[Planet|planets]], stars, and [[Galaxy|galaxies]]. One of these stars is actually *Voidsedge*, the Black Butterfly's [[Starknife|starknife]], which she can call to her hand at any time.


## Relationships

> The Black Butterfly despises all sorts of [[Evil|evil]], and views the [[Dark Tapestry]] as its worst form. Few can match her knowledge about the Dark Tapestry, but she refuses to share this knowledge, as she thinks that doing so will help her foes.


## Church

> The Black Butterfly's followers are those who live lives of silence, like the deaf and the mute, and explorers venturing into uncharted territory. The Black Butterfly is typically worshiped in monasteries atop mountain peaks, in underground spaces, and on [[Asteroid|asteroids]]. On holy days, her devotees eschew loud spectacles. Creatures she favors include [[Celestial|celestial]] [[Gloomwing|gloomwings]], [[Star monarch|star monarchs]], and [[Yamah|yamahs]].
> Her most obedient followers perform an anonymous charitable act each day, in order to foster the perception that good things sometimes happen to one just because one deserves it. If the beneficiary is seen or spoken to, the follower must spend an hour blindfolded while praying, then tithe to a temple of the Black Butterfly or other [[Good|good]] [[Deity|god]].


### Holy symbol

> Black Butterfly's [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] is a black [[Butterfly|butterfly]] with a star on its thorax.
