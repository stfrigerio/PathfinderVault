>  **Torag** (pronounced TORR-awg) is a stoic and serious [[god]] who values honor, planning, and well-made steel. He is an often distant deity, lending magical power to his [[clerics]], but leaving his followers to make their own way through life, knowing that this will make them strong and determined.



## History

>  During the [[Age of Creation]], Torag was among the original gods who battled the [[Rough Beast]] who sought to destroy [[Golarion]]. He and [[Gorum]] forged the shell of the [[Dead Vault]], which would serve as Rovagug's prison after his defeat.
>  The [[dwarves]] believe that Torag created the world at his great forge, striking it again and again with his hammer to get the shape he desired. As rocks tumbled and the sparks flew, the dwarves were born, made of stone with bellies full of fire. These dwarves were created deep in the [[Darklands]] and were perfectly suited to their environment. Torag ruled them justly for centuries, and they worked hard to be worthy of his approval. He gave them a single prophecy: that one day the earth would shake, and they would leave their darkened homes to press upwards in a [[Quest for Sky]]. When [[Earthfall]] struck in [[-5293 AR]], the dwarves took this as the fulfillment of their prophecy, and began the centuries-long migration to [[Golarion's]] surface.


## Dogma

>  Torag condemns suicide, and the [[souls]] of his worshipers who take their own lives are condemned to [[Avernus]], the first circle of [[Hell]].


## Relationships

>  Torag is opposed to destructive and aggressive deities as a god of protection and creation. He and his followers have battled Rovagug and other destructive forces since the dawn of time. Despite their mutual opposition to Rovagug, the followers of [[Sarenrae]] and Torag are rarely close, following different codes of belief. Dwarves do not understand the worship of the sun, and see Sarenrae's willingness to forgive as folly and a sign of weakness. Torag respects [[Abadar]] and is friendly with both [[Cayden Cailean]] and [[Iomedae]]. Of all the deities, Torag has most respect for [[Erastil]] as they both value community and family.
>  Torag is the head of the [[dwarven pantheon]]. Of all these gods, only the bitter [[Droskar]], a former student and now the [[Duergar]] god of toil and slavery, holds no allegiance to Torag. The two deities are engaged in a slow-burning cold war that has continued for centuries.
>  Torag loathes [[Moloch]], seeing Moloch's portfolio as a corruption of his own. In turn, Moloch considers Torag's priests his favourite sacrifices and actively seeks to convert dwarves. [[Zursvaater]] respects him as a smith, but considers his dwarven followers persistent pests and teaches his [[fire giants]] to [[enslave]] dwarves when possible.
>  As part of a deal for a precious gem, Torag made the [[Gnome]] [[Nivi Rhombodazzle]] into a [[godling]].


## Appearance

>  Torag appears as a powerful and cunning dwarf, busy at his forge hammering out a weapon or shield. He is the consummate planner, with a contingency for nearly every situation. Art shows him as a stereotypical dwarf in intricate armor and carrying his warhammer *Kaglemros* ([[Dwarven]] for '"forger of many weapons").


## Providence

>  The Father of Creation sometimes sends messages that appear etched in stone to those he favors, while earthquakes are seen as the ultimate sign of his anger. Those who survive an earthquake are thought to be blessed.


## Home

>  Torag and his family live in Forgeheart, watching over his people, outfitting Heaven's armies with his forges and defending Heaven from incursions.


## Servants

>  Torag and his faithful hold creatures of the earth as mighty and holy, especially burrowing animals like [[badgers]]. [[Bats]] are loathed as abominations almost as much as the writhing spawn of Rovagug. His [[divine servitors]] are the [[Chalkost]], formed from perfect dwarven spirits, who spend eternity creating new arms and armor to defend the walls of [[Heaven]].


### Unique servants

Ambassador Zurin
A cunning [[Azer]] noble, he is dispatched to handle the subtler matters requiring Torag's attention.
[[The Grand Defender]]
Appearing as a huge iron construct in the shape of a dwarf with a hammer and shield, the [[Herald]] of Torag simply sloughs its outer layer of armor when "defeated".
Hrilga Shield-Maiden
This [[Celestial]] dwarven [[Werebear]] serves Torag loyally in all things.
Stoneriver
A [[Bulette]] who swims the molten rivers of the earth's depths as readily as the cold earth nearer the surface.

## Church of Torag

>  The ancient church of Torag can be found in all dwarven lands, and in many human ones, especially the harsh northern lands of the [[Ulfen]] people. His centers of worship include [[Druma]], the [[Five Kings Mountains]], the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], the [[Steaming Sea]], and the [[Mana Wastes]], and is popular among [[Taldans]] and [[Ulfen]] throughout the [[Inner Sea region]].

>  Tradition is a focus for [[knights]] who follow Torag. Action, rather than ceremony, is what these knights crave. They can be counted on to protect their communities without hesitation.


### Clergy

>  Nearly half of Torag's clerics are dwarves, and although many [[humans]] have taken up his call as well. Among dwarves, almost all of his priests are clerics, with maybe ten percent being [[paladins]] or other followers. Among his Ulfen, nearly all are clerics, and human paladins of Torag are essentially unheard of. Many of his followers are architects, artisans of all stripes, or military planners. He is also popular among guards and city watchmen, who pray to him for protection.
>  As befits a deity so closely associated with the anvil and bellows, the vestments of Torag's clergy are a long, well-used smithing apron, and hammer. Rings of various sorts (whether worn on the hands, in the ear, or woven into the hair or beard) are also common, symbolizing friendship, debt, or allegiance. Some priests attach badges, rivets, or plates to their raiments that commemorate important life events such as the birth of a child, marriage, or their first forging of a complete set of [[plate mail]].


### Temples and shrines

>  Temples tend to be circular, built around a large central and fully-functional forge and satellite anvils used for even mundane tasks, for every act of smelting and smithing is considered a prayer to Torag. In outdoor settlements, the temple is usually built into the defensive wall, as this keeps the noise away from the other residences and makes it easier for the priests to monitor the defenses.
>  The center of Torag's worship is the metropolis of [[Highhelm Militia]] in the [[Five Kings Mountains]]. There, the High Defender guides the faithful from the fortress-temple known as the Forge of Torag.


### Holy sites

>  On the northeastern plains of [[Galt]] lies the settlement of [[Azurestone]], named after a giant blue rock that towers 100 feet over the town. The dwarves of the nearby [[Fog Peaks]] believe that it is a holy spear cast down by Torag during prehistory, and make regular pilgrimages there.


### Holy texts

>  Torag's texts tend to be sturdily bound tomes, able to survive whatever hardships its owner may face.

[[Hammer and Tongs: The Forging of Metal and Other Good Works]]
This tome is usually bound in metal with lacquered leather interior pages.

### Holidays

>  The church celebrates the anniversary of successful battles and Skylost where appropriate.


### Favored animals

>  Gods are often associated with certain [[Animals]], either because they possess a quality favored by the god, or because the god's faithful feel a special kinship to them. Torag's favored animals include [[badgers]], burrowing animals, cave-dwelling animals, and armadillos.


## Organizations

>  The [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Godclaw]] venerates the lawful aspects of Torag, but is in no way associated with his religion or followers.


>  [[Paizo]] published a major article about Torag and his church in *[[Curse of the Lady's Light]]*, p70*ff.*
