> **Cihua Couatl** are a dualistic [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] [[Deity|deity]], patron of those who protect others for the cause of [[Good|good]] and of midwives taking care of children. They teach that conflict cannot be avoided, and one must be ready to help those who cannot defend themselves, whether by taking [[Weapon|arms]], encouraging help, or teaching kindness; caring for others makes everyone stronger.


## Appearance and emissaries

> Cihua Couatl consist of a [[Chicome couatl|chicome]] and a [[Tletli couatl|tletli]] [[Couatl|couatl]] sharing the same body and both are of fluid gender. Each has its own tail and head, but they share the same arms, one carrying a [[Shield|shield]] and the other carrying a [[Shortspear|shortspear]]. Their constant shift between the roles of attacker and defender, as well as gender, signifies that everyone can care for and protect others.


## Church of Cihua Couatl

> Cihua Couatl are worshipped by couatls, [[Healer|healers]], and [[Warrior|warriors]]. They are adept at strategy and tactics and favour quick, decisive action, allowing them to swiftly end conflicts with minimal casualties on both sides.
