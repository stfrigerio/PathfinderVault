> The [[Tian Xia]] [[Deity|goddess]] **Lao Shu Po** began her life as an ordinary [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Rat|rat]], and stole her [[Deity|divinity]] by feasting off the corpse of the slain [[Deity|god]] [[Tsukiyo]].



## Appearance

> Lao Shu Po commonly takes one of two forms, either that of an aged old [[Hag|hag]] or an enormous six-legged black rat.


## Holy symbol and animal

> Her [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is an emaciated rat curled into a circle, and unsurprisingly, she considers the rat her [[Sacred animal|sacred animal]].


## History

> Originally, according to legends, Lao Shu Po was merely a normal rat. This changed after the traitorous [[Fumeiyoshi]] slew his brother, the [[Moon|moon]] god Tsukiyo. The rat Lao Shu Po somehow found her way to the moon god's grave and feasted upon his divine flesh as he lay buried, absorbing some of his divine power. Tsukiyo was resurrected by the goddess [[Shizuru]] and, when they took vengeance on the vile Fumeiyoshi, Lao Shu Po was able to ascend to full blown godhood, usurping Fumeiyoshi's previous role as god of the night: she became goddess of the night, rats, and thieves.


## Home

> Lao Shu Po has long dwelt in [[Abaddon]]. She is content with the alleys and sewers of the [[Awaiting-Consumption|Slave City of Awaiting-Consumption]] and has never felt the need to claim her own domain.


## Church of Lao Shu Po

> Lao Shu Po's worship is common throughout the [[Darklands]] of Tian Xia and her cults frequently fester beneath the city of [[Goka]]. Surprisingly, she is worshipped in the [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]] nation of [[Kwanlai]]. Her other centres of worship are less surprising: dark, monster-haunted lands like [[Shenmen]], [[Wanshou]], and the lawless Wandering Isles of [[Minata]].
