> **Gorum** (pronounced GOR-um) is a [[God|god]] of battle above all other pursuits; it is said that he would rust away into nothingness if there is ever a time with no more conflicts to be fought. Known as **Our Lord in Iron**, his faithful believe he is present in every [[Iron|iron]] [[Weapon|weapon]] of war that is forged.



## History

> Gorum's presence was unknown in the earliest days of [[Golarion]]. His clergy claim he was formed from battle itself, a suit of iron [[Armor|armor]] standing alone on the battlefield once the dust had settled. His genesis is generally considered to have resulted from conflicts that erupted between [[Orc|orcs]] and [[Human|humans]] following the former race's surge to the surface during the [[Age of Darkness]]. Warriors and knights have ever since claimed to see a vision of the god as they strike a killing blow or charge into battle. Gorum is considered the divine embodiment of martial prowess and glory on the battlefield.
> According to ancient legend, the devil [[Alichino]] tasked the legendary hero [[Strada]] with the conquest of an invincible city. Strada sought the help of an oracle of Gorum and was given the thousand fangs of the [[Dragon|dragon]] [[Kathalphas]]. When Strada sowed the teeth into the ground outside the city as instructed, all the heroes the dragon had devoured sprang up into battle. Having frustrated the devil, Strada ruled the city for 90 years with the skeletal army as guard. Magical [[Spartoi seeds|spartoi seeds]] that temporarily summon the skeletal undead warriors known as [[Spartolos|spartoloi]] have been created since in memory of this legend.


## Relationships

> Gorum concerns himself with few matters outside of battle, and this attitude extends to include his relations with other deities. He sees little value in matters of diplomacy and politics, considering the pursuits of his divine peers as frivolous a best. The Lord in Iron is considered brash and impulsive; he takes what he wants, by force if necessary, and answers any direct opposition to his will with violence. His priests and followers tend to follow the god's example, which means that there are more ruthless and exploitative members of his faith than those who espouse altruism.


## Appearance

 
 An altar to Gorum.
> Gorum's manifestation is that of a gigantic humanoid being in darkened heavy armor. His helmet covers all defining features except for a pair or fiery crimson eyes. No matter to whom he appears, Gorum will always appear to be the tallest creature, even when among [[Giant|giants]] and other large humanoids.


## Servants

> Most of Gorum's divine minions wear spiked metal armor. This includes his [[Divine servitor|divine servitor race]], the [[Zentragt|zentragt]]. These [[Bear|bear-like]] creatures often serve in the vanguard of the Lord in Iron's armies.


### Unique servants

Bloody Hands or Blood Hands
This servant is a crimson-skinned creature similar in appearance to a [[Hezrou|hezrou]] [[Demon|demon]].
[[First Blade]]
Gorum's [[Herald|herald]] is a horde of animated weapons and shields that swarm together into a humanoid shape, and is the approximate shape and size of an [[Iron golem|iron golem]].
Saint Fang
This minion is similar to a [[Silver dragon|silver dragon]] with spikes, but with coloring akin to iron.
Temperbrand
This creature is a [[Fire elemental|fire elemental]] that has the appearance of superheated liquid metal.

## Providence

> Gorum shows his favor through weapons and armor that bleed when touched, while his displeasure is seen when these same items quickly develop unnatural patches of rust, or else fall apart completely.


## Church of Gorum

> The church of Gorum proclaims faith in strength and power over spirituality or intellect. High priests are great warriors who attain their position through battle. Priests wear heavy spiked armor and forsake non-metallic weapons. They believe that the spirit of Gorum resides in all metal weapons and armor, and therefore take care to keep them polished and in good working order. The services conducted by the church consist primarily of actual and improvised [[Percussion|percussion]], to include clanging weapons against shields.


### Worshipers

> Gorum is worshiped by mercenaries and barbarians all across the world, but are most commonly found in lands where conflict and battle are common. These include [[Brevoy]], [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], [[Nirmathas]], [[Numeria]], the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], and the [[River Kingdoms]], and among [[Kellid human ethnicity|Kellids]], [[Shoanti]], [[Ulfen]], [[Dwarf|dwarves]], and [[Half-orc|half-orcs]] throughout the [[Inner Sea region]]. It is not uncommon for two opposing armies to be carrying the Lord in Iron's standard into battle, which doesn't seem to bother the god; he's more interested in promoting the fighting rather than picking a winner.
> One of Gorum's most hardcore sects is the Theocracy of the Fist, which controls a small archipelago of volcanic islands.
> The Lord in Iron is commonly worshiped by half-orcs, who believe that he is one of them, and that his encasement in iron is the deity's successful effort to hide his true nature from human worshipers who would be unable to handle his true nature. This belief continues to spread, thanks to the teachings of the orc warlord-turned-proselytizer named Naellk, who had a vision of himself in an idol of the deity in battle. He is also claimed by Kellids, who find the orc claims that the Lord in Iron is one of their kind heresy, and wars between the two racial groups have increased since this claim emerged. Most of Gorum's priests are [[Cleric|clerics]], although there are some [[Druids|druids]]. [[Bard|Bards]] and [[Ranger|rangers]] may perform some service within the church, but are not members of the priesthood.
> [[Knight|Knightly]] followers of Gorum believe battle is the true calling of a knight, not tournaments or courtly pursuits. For Iron Knights, strength and determination supersede honor, duty, and fame. More than other orders, Gorumite knights are often found as mercenaries.


### Temples and shrines

> Gorum's temples tend to have the appearance of strongholds or citadels. They are walled and gated, and spikes adorn the structure. They are always ready for a battle or siege, and are kept stocked with metal weapons, armor, and rations. Shrines to Gorum are typically an organized pile of rocks with a helmet or blade set atop.


### Holy texts

> Gorum's church claims no holy text, but it does feature a set of seven holy poems called the *Gorumskagat*. A controversial text, the *Myth in Iron*, maintained by secluded priests in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] recording great and powerful accomplishments of Gorumites in the past, is seen as heretical by some.


### Favored animals

> Gods are often associated with certain [[Animal|animals]], either because they possess a quality favored by the god, or because the god's faithful feel a special kinship to them. Gorum's favored animals include [[Rhinoceros|rhinoceroses]], [[Dinosaur|dinosaurs]], and war-trained animals.


> [[Paizo]] published a major article about Gorum in *[[War of the River Kings]]*.
