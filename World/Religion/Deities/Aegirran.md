> **Aegirran** is a [[Demigod|demigod]] of the [[Storm giant|storm giants]] and presides over sailing, dreams, and ocean voyages. He is wed to [[Skode|Skode the huntress]], but is separated from her except during the changing of the seasons. He is said to travel both above and below the waves of the oceans with their nine daughters in a shell-encrusted fleet. Their three sons are said to be the biting fangs of the north wind that harrow the [[Evil|wicked]], while their daughters are the gentle south, east, and west winds that bring the rain and [[Sun|sun]] that nourishes both the coast and inland areas. Aegirran protects those who travel over the ocean, and sends them dreams of their loved ones.
