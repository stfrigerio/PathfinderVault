> **Skrymir** is the trickster god of the [[Storm giant|storm giants]], and is said to be related to [[Bergelmir]]. Numerous giant clans have varying interpretations of their relationship, saying that they are either mother and son, cousins, or siblings. Skrymir often travels the land in disguise, and rewards those who pass his tests of wit.
