> **Zohls** is a powerful [[Archon|archon]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] dedicated to investigation, truth, and determination. A being driven by logic, she revels in uncovering mysteries and sees existence as connected, interlocking puzzles, but has difficulty remembering that not everyone can perceive logic as she can.



## Home

> The Palace of Zohls is located within the [[Grand Court of Heaven]]; the court is the arbiter of [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|goodness]] itself on [[Iudica]], the sixth level of [[Heaven]].


## Appearance

> Zohls is a woman with chestnut hair tied into a braid and wings made of always-smooth paper, clad in black-and-white breeches and tunic.


## Relationships

> Zohls finds it difficult to interact with less perceptive beings, including fellow [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lords]], and rarely visits them, but greatly enjoys intelligent conversations with both [[Mortality|mortals]] and [[Deity|deities]] alike. Zohls views those who try to hide information, especially crimes, with ire, and often uncovers and foils [[Evil|evil]] plots, most often those of [[Devil|devils]].


## Cults

> Zohls is worshipped by all kinds of truth seekers, who often receive an anonymous visit from her agents who provide them with hints or evidence.


## Family

> Zohls has a daughter, Hebath, also an archon, who works in the 77th House of Judgment.
