## Relationships

 A Family Tree of the Osirian Pantheon
> Nephthys is the sister of [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]], and sister-wife of [[Set]]. After Set murdered Osiris, Nephthys helped Isis gather Osiris' pieces and protected her nephew [[Horus]]. Despite being Set's wife, she has no children with him and usually sides with Osiris and Isis against him. [[Anubis]] is Nephthys' illegitimate son with Osiris, born when she seduced him with [[Alcoholic beverages|wine]].


## Cults

> Nephthys is usually worshipped in small shrines in temples of Anubis, Osiris or Isis, or more rarely those of Set, and has few temples of her own. Her [[Cleric|clerics]] mourn and assist other priests at funerals, working alongside the church of [[Pharasma]] if needed.
