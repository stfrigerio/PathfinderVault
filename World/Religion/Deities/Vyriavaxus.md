![[Demonic_assassination.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Nocticula assassinates Vyriavaxus.
> The [[Demon lord|demon lord]] **Vyriavaxus** is the latest of the notable victims of [[Nocticula]]. She seduced and killed him, and, as is her custom, there is now one of the [[Midnight Isles]] in her [[Abyssal realm]] whose themes are based around him.



## Home

> Like many dead demon lords, Vyriavaxus' quasi-soul now resides in the [[Abyss|Abyssal]] [[Rift of Repose]].


## Relationships

> His cavernous realm of [[Rankarrus]] was close to that of [[Camazotz]]'s [[Argahoz]], and some speculate that Camazotz may have been his sire. He was the patron of the [[Shadow demon|shadow demons]], and Nocticula killed him to gain control over them. Nevertheless, some shadow demons maintain loyalty to Vyriavaxus plotting to resurrect their former master.


## Appearance

> He is said to have appeared as a gigantic [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bat]], sucking the [[Soul|souls]] from mortals with his tongue.


## Church

> In [[Golarion]], he was one of the demon lords worshipped in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. The [[Sabosan|sabosan]] of the Expanse continue to worship him.
