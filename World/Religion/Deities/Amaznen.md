> **Amaznen** was the primary [[Deity|god]] of [[Magic|magic]] in the ancient [[Azlant|Azlanti empire]]. His worship was outlawed in the younger [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] empire, possibly because of his fierce rivalry with the goddess [[Lissala]]. He was killed during [[Earthfall]].



## Relationships

> The followers of Amaznen had a rivalry with those of the other Azlanti [[Deity|deity]] of magic, Lissala. Their disagreement stemmed from the fact that Amaznen taught that some knowledge should be kept secret, while Lissala believed that knowledge should always be shared.
> Despite the mismatch in their outlook, Amaznen was the lover of the [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] [[Deity|goddess]] of the [[Moon|moon]] and battle, [[Acavna]]. He also counted among his allies [[Aesocar]], whom he appreciated for his inventiveness and promotion of [[Medicine|medicine]] and [[Technology|technology]]; and [[Jaidi]], who worked with him to improve [[Human|humanity]].
> Prior to Earthfall, the future Last Azlanti and patron of humanity [[Aroden]] was a follower of Amaznen and Acavna. They were cited as an example that gods can die, but humanity will live on, in Aroden's dogma.


## History

> When Acavna learned that the [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]] had called down a massive, [[Poison|poisonous]], world-killing [[Meteorite|meteorite]] from the depths of space to destroy Azlant, she was willing to sacrifice herself to protect her worshippers and [[Golarion]]; none of Amaznen's words could convince her otherwise. She used her powers to divert the orbit of [[Moon Golarion|Golarions moon]] to intercept the projectile, shattering the alghollthu [[Weapon|weapon]] into thousands of pieces that pierced the physical manifestation of the goddess, killing her. Distraught by tremendous grief, Amaznen siphoned the glyph magic of the alghollthus from the debris into himself, stepping over the edge of reality and vanishing from existence. The *[[Starstone]]*, as the meteorite came to be called, was transformed from something that could have ended all life on Golarion, to something which, while still causing untold damage and bringing about the [[Age of Darkness]], gave life on the [[Planet|planet]] a chance of survival.
