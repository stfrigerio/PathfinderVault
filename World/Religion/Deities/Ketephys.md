>  **Ketephys** is the tight-lipped [[elven god]] of the hunt, who instructs his followers to care for the forest and defend it from his arch-enemy [[Treerazer]].



## Home

>  The Amaranthine Forest, Ketephys's Realm, is an endless wilderness located in [[Elysium]]. Within the forest, Ketephys resides in a tree that no one else can ever find. He is a nomadic god, and his realm slowly follows him as he wanders from place to place.


## Appearance

>  Ketephys takes the form of an [[Elf]] with russet skin, [[Hawk]] eyes and feathers in place of hair. He is barefoot and wears a grey feather cloak, a green and brown hunting jerkin, and fur wraps around his ankle. He is never seen without his [[heralds]], Meycho (a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog]]) and Falling Star (a [[Hawk]]), whom he treats as friends rather then helpers.


## Relationships

>  Ketephys is friendly with fellow elven [[deities]] [[Yuelral]] and [[Findeladlara]], who often speak on his behalf and work with him to improve the impact of elven [[Magic]]. His priests know that they can call on Yuelral or Findeladlara for help, but Ketephys and Yuelral disagree with Findeladlara's refusal of non-elven followers.
>  Ketephys is an occasional hunting partner of [[Erastil]], but disapproves of his insistence upon marriage; in turn, Erastil attributes this to elven immaturity and capriciousness. Ketephys is an ally of [[Gozreh]] against threats to the natural world. He views Treerazer as his arch-enemy, and personally served as a commander during the conflict that pushed Treerazer to [[Tanglebriar]], where he hides to this day. Ketephys also watches over [[Cyth-V'sug]], Treerazer's former master, for any signs of an alliance between the two.


## Cults

>  Ketephys is worshipped by many elven [[rangers]] and [[hunters]], as well as many small communities and non-elves. Ketephys accepts followers of all races as long as they respect nature. His centre of worship is [[Sovyrian]], ancestral home of the elves, although he also counts many followers on [[Golarion]] as well. Some of his followers also worship Findeladlara, Yuelral, and [[Calistria]]; all involved [[gods]] accept this polytheism and hold no jealousy toward the others.


### Holy symbol

>  Ketephys' [[holy symbol]] is a hawk on a [[silver]] crescent.


>  [[Paizo]] published a major article about Ketephys in *[[Faiths of Golarion]]*.
