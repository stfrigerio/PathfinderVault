> Orcus (pronounced OHR-kuhs) is the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of the [[Undead|undead]] and those who practice vile [[Necromancy|necromancy]], but is also associated with the sin of wrath. He is a major object of worship throughout the [[Material Plane]], yet has a relatively small following on [[Golarion]]. As the demon lord of necromancy, Orcus seems to call more to those who have chosen undeath freely, rather than those who acquired it by accident.



## Appearance

> Orcus has a fearsome appearance, though he certainly looks more human than some of the other demon lords like [[Dagon]] and [[Zevgavizeb]]. Orcus takes the shape of a fat humanoid with the head and cloven feet of a demonic ram, the wings of a an enormous bat, and a tail ending in a stinger. Orcus wields his infamous heavy mace called the ***Wand of Orcus***.


## Home

> Orcus' [[Abyssal realm]] is called [[Uligor]]—an entire world filled with undead, where Orcus is engaged in a war for supremacy of the realm against a number of [[Thanatotic titan|thanatotic titans]].


## Cult and worshipers

> Orcus is one of the demon lords with the most aggressive intentions on the [[Material Plane]], but his influence on [[Golarion]] is relatively small. The only places where Orcus has any real cults (rather than the lone madmen who typically turn to demon worship) is in [[Geb's Rest]], and some of the isolated, backwater areas of shadowy [[Nidal]]. While his devout followers claim Orcus is merely biding his time before making some grand move on Golarion, a more realistic reason for the demon lord's lack of local popularity is the intense competition with the more popular cults of [[Zura]], [[Kabriri]], and [[Urgathoa]].
> Very few [[Vampire|vampires]] or [[Ghoul|ghouls]] are counted among Orcus' servitors, due to Zura's and Kabriri's dominions over them. To Orcus' followers, the [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] is the epitome of undeath, due to the power wielded by one and the patience, power, skill and talent needed to become one. In contrast, vampires and [[Hungry undead|hungry undead]] are considered the weakest undead, as they spread like diseases, most quickly among the weak. Accidental undead rank only higher, as hard-working liches feel jealousy and frustration over those who become [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] simply by chance. They are outranked by even [[Mindless undead|mindless undead]], calculated additions to the world that only as a result of a [[Necromancer|necromancer]]'s skill.
> The demon lord's followers are also always opposed by those of the goddess [[Pharasma]], who seek to root out necromancy and undeath wherever they find it. In turn, Orcus' followers consider being judged by Pharasma and becoming a [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioner]] as wasted potential and consider undeath the true reward for life.
> Orcus is known to have followers who claim the calling of the [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Antipaladin|antipaladin]].
> One of Orcus' most powerful followers is the [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] [[Phaegia]], a former priestess of [[Aroden]] who converted to the demon lord's worship towards the end of her life.
> Among other races, the [[Dero|dero]] are the most likely to venerate Orcus. He is also worshipped by [[Orc|orcs]] who focus on his aspect as a demon lord of death and anger, although his followers still appreciate the tactical advantages that mimicking his mastery of undead hordes can grant them.


### Temples

> Only two temples to Orcus are known to exist on Golarion. The first can be found in the Temple Row district of the ruined city of [[Xin-Shalast]], high in the [[Kodar Mountains]] of northeatern [[Varisia]]. It is located alongside shrines to other demon lords and [[Archdevil|archdevils]] including [[Mammon]], [[Pazuzu]], and [[Lamashtu]]; it is not known whether the temple is ruined or active.
The second is located far to the south, below the ruined city of [[Saventh-Yhi]] in the [[Mwangi Jungle]]. Here, a more fetishistic form of the demon lord was venerated by an ancient [[Zombie|zombie]] cult.
Rumors exist that a shrine to Orcus can be found within the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrants]] prison of [[Gallowspire]], although this has not been confirmed.


## Servants

> In his Abyssal realm of Uligor, Orcus is served by strange demon-undead hybrids, powerful liches, and [[Lilitu|lilitu]] demons. His most powerful servant is the [[Balor|balor lord]] Goriath, the Soul Drinker, who has been ordered to retake a remote city-fortress in Uligor. In the past, the powerful [[Marilith|marilith]] [[Ylleshka]] also pledged fealty to the Prince of Undeath, although this is no longer the case.
