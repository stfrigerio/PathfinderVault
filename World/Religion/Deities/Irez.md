> **Irez** is a powerful [[Agathion|agathion]] [[Empyreal lord]]. She emerged from the reeds along the coast of the [[Sea of No Shadows]] in [[Nirvana]] and she still considers it home. Her palace has a marvellous architecture where the floors are made from woven reed, the walls from paper and the roofs from bamboo. While it looks fragile it has stood undamaged for thousands of years. Irez, the Lady of Inscribed Wonder, understands the true symbolism of [[Rune|runes]] and how they can empower arcane [[Magic|magic]]. Her agents teach the art of calligraphy to favored [[Mortal|mortals]].
