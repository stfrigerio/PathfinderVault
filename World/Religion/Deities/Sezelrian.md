> **Sezelrian the Fire God** is a [[Demigod|demigod]] said to have brought intelligence and [[Magic|magic]] to the [[Orc|orcs]]. He teaches that orcs need intelligence in addition to strength to control fire and magic, but has no patience for knowledge without immediate use.



## Appearance

> Sezelrian looks like an orc [[Witch|witch]] or [[Oracle|oracle]] wielding a [[Mace|mace]] that constantly smokes and sparks without burning. He often hides his face behind a burning [[Demon|demon]] mask.


## Relationships

> Sezelrian rarely fights other orc demigods, but prefers to instigate conflicts between them, serving as an adviser to one such belligerent. He prefers to ally with [[Zagresh]], who appreciates the power of fire, and favours [[Nulgreth]] the least of all.


## Cults

> All orc [[Arcane magic|arcane]] and [[Divine magic|divine spellcasters]] pray to Sezelrian, regardless of which [[Deity|deity]] they worship. These orcs often incorporate smoke or flame into their rituals, and brand their flesh with burns. Common sacred objects found in Sezelrian worship include bonfires, burnt offerings, or even just candles placed on skulls. Tribes dedicated to Sezelrian are usually more tolerant of members who use magic.
