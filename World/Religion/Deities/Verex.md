> **Verex** (also known as the **Blood God** and the **Despoiler**) is the [[Orc|orc]] [[Deity|god]] of lust, devastation, and pillage. Whereas followers of [[Nulgreth]] simply seek the deaths of their enemies, the faithful of Verex seek to destroy them wholly, take all they once had, and pillage the rest.


## Worship

> Whereas in other pantheons, gods of thievery are worshiped in secret, Verex is venerated openly among the orcs.
