> In the annals of the [[Abyss]], **Sithhud**, the Frozen Lord, is an example of a rare occurrence: the descent, or demotion, of a fully fledged [[Demon lord|demon lord]] to the lower ranks of a [[Demon lordNascent demon lord|nascent demon lord]].


## Background, home, and relationships

> Sithhud once completely controlled the cold [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Jhuvumirak]] until the demon lord [[Kostchtchie]] arrived with his army and defeated the incumbent and claimed the realm as his own. To this day, Kostchtchie rules in Jhuvumirak, while Sithhud hides in the highest peaks of the realm where the Deathless Frost has yet to search.
> Sithhud's unholy symbol is a frost-caked, skeletal, three-fingered hand or claw.


## Appearance

> Sithhud appears as a twisted and strange humanoid: three spindly legs support a frozen, deformed skeleton figure. The Frozen Lord possesses a breath of blizzards that kills and animates his victims as undead vassals.
