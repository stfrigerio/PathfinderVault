> **Il'surrish the Wanderer** is the itinerant, incorporeal, and gender-fluid [[Protean lord|protean lord]] of formlessness, loss of control, and potential.



## Home

> Il'surrish's realm is the Labyrinth of Light and Loss, which moves across the [[Maelstrom|Cerulean Void]]. It is surrounded by the corpses of petrified [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] and broken remains of the [[Primordial inevitable|primordial inevitable]] Argreth the Burning Monolith.


## Appearance

> Il'surrish rarely takes physical form and often drifts through the [[Maelstrom]] in the form of a cloud of partially coalescent light. When the Wanderer does take a physical form, it appears as a lesser [[Protean|protean]] made of cerulean light, or more often, it possesses a [[Demon|demon]], [[Devil|devil]], or [[Archon|archon]], which, consumed by the experience, burns out like a metaphysical candle. Survivors only recall a horrific and beautiful experience, like that of a [[Keketar|keketar]] when first communing with the [[Speakers of the Depths]]. Il'surrish bears a resemblance to the [[Abyss|Abyssal]] entity known as the Risen, but lacks the Risen's malevolent, parasitic nature.


## Cults

> Il'surrish's clergy, known as the **Asomatous Clutch**, consists mostly of insubstantial proteans, many of whom are incorporeal, including whole choruses of incorporeal keketars.
