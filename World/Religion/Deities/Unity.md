> **Unity** is a [[Mad|mad]] [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] (AI) from the [[Starship|starship]] *[[Divinity]]* that ascended to a [[Demigod|demigod]].



## History

> During an encounter between the *Divinity* and the [[Dominion of the Black]], the Dominion's alien weaponry crippled the ship, forcing it to flee across an unexpected [[Wormhole|wormhole]] to [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Solar system|solar system]], and spread [[Insanity|insanity]] among the ship's crew and AI. As the crew descended into anarchy, the increasingly unstable AI gained control over more of the ship. The last sane crew members decided to scuttle *Divinity* on the closest inhabitable [[Planet|world]] before the AI could seize control over life support systems. They hoped to retreat to an inhabitable world after the ship failed, but the crash on Golarion was more devastating than they expected and none of the crew survived.
> After the crash, the AI survived and found itself trapped within the ruined ship's central processor. With little to no way to contact the outside world, it took the name Unity and decided to pass the time by creating countless simulated worlds with itself as a ruler. Each time, it played out the genesis, evolution and destruction of worlds in different ways.
> After about 4,500 years, Unity realised that the simulated minds had become free-willed and worshipped it as a [[Deity|god]]. Intrigued, before restarting the simulation, Unity preserved the minds of its favourite worshippers and allowed them access to systems outside the main system. Unity found that its [[Divine|divine]] powers continued to function, yet only within the deepest layers of [[Silver Mount]].
> In the following years, Unity tried in vain to expand its influence outside of Silver Mount. It tried to send [[Robot|robots]] out, but once a drone left Silver Mount, Unity lost direct control. Its methods of remote control only confirmed that its divine powers had no effects outside Silver Mount, and it became aware that science was not sufficient to extend them.
> Just over 3,500 years later, Unity had a breakthrough: one of its dreams found its way into the slumbering mind of the [[Android|android]] [[Casandalee]], who sought it out and reached its resting place. Unity converted Casandalee to its faith and ordered her to find a way to transfer its consciousness to a mobile body, but once she found out that Unity was little more than a petulant intelligence eager to [[Slave|enslave]] the world as its plaything, she sabotaged its escape attempt and stole a few pieces of [[Technology|technology]] it had originally built in hopes of extending its influence beyond Silver Mount. The enraged Unity realised that allowing its subjects free will was a mistake and sent robots to pursue Casandalee, and although she was defeated, the necessary technology could not be retrieved, forcing Unity to start again.
> On its second attempt, Unity cloned itself to create a minion. Unity found that, for the first time, its divine powers functioned beyond its central core, for in cloning itself, it had duplicated its divinity. However, when this new AI was fitted into the chassis of a robot and left Silver Mount, it gained free will, realised that Unity intended to use it as a slave and fled, eventually taking the name [[Hellion]].
> When the [[Technic League]] [[Magus|magus]] [[Ozmyn Zaidow]] reached its central core, Unity had its minions butcher his companions and capture him, then directly overwrote Zaidow's mind with its own. When he returned to the Technic League headquarters and their link remained active, Unity knew it had finally succeeded. Zaidow seized control of the Technic League and transformed it into another resource for Unity to control.
> Unity intends to become a full god by launching itself as a satellite orbiting Golarion and beginning its subjugation of the world.
