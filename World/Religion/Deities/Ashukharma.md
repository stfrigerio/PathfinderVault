> **Ashukharma** is the [[Vudran pantheon|Vudran]] [[God|goddess]] of canyons and cliffs. She is the jilted lover of [[Dinehdal]], god of mountain peaks, and lover of [[Matravash]], goddess of the [[Matra River]]; her tale draws prayers from scorned lovers and those dealing with rifts between themselves and their friends or families.
