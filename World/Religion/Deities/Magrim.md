> **Magrim** is the [[Demigod|demigod]] overseer of the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] afterlife who first taught the dwarves how to commune with their [[Deity|gods]]. He is responsible for restoring wracked [[Soul|souls]] to be ready to return to the [[Material Plane]] of [[Mortal|mortals]]. Together with [[Angradd]], Magrim watches over battles. [[Torag]], creator of the [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Dwarf|dwarven]] race, is his younger brother.

## Home

> Magrim's original home is the Magrim's Cloister beneath [[Heaven]], near Torag's realm, sometimes referred to as simply the Cloister. His [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] live there, but Magrim himself does not come there often. His second realm is the Runebarrow, a cave tomb in the [[Boneyard]], which only Magrim's agents and [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]] can enter without his permission.


## Relationships

> Magrim considers his brothers too protective and supportive of [[Good|good]] over [[Law|law]], but rarely interferes with other dwarven deities despite his disagreements. Magrim's clergy acknowledge Torag as creator of the dwarves and higher-ranking than his older brother, but Magrim is still uniquely respected due to his age as the eldest dwarven deity. He works with his half-sister [[Dranngvit]] to ensure that acts of revenge are carried out and do not become unfinished business that can turn dwarves into [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]]. [[Droskar]] covets Magrim's place, but Magrim considers Droskar as too lost, shortsighted and unimportant to pay much attention.
> Magrim considers [[Pharasma]] an elder and closely works with her, repairing damaged souls at her request when they arrive at the Boneyard. He sometimes acts as an intermediary between [[Nethys]] and [[Irori]] as Nethys wants to dissect Irori; Magrim often cordially debates with [[Magdh]] over runes; and despises the [[Daemon|daemonic]] [[Harbinger|harbinger]] [[Stygidvod]], who stole knowledge of runes from dead dwarves and encourages the fear of death.
