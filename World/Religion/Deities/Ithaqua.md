> **Ithaqua** is the [[Great Old One]] of [[Cannibalism|cannibalism]], cold, and the wind.



## Home

> Ithaqua is capable of travelling on icy winds between [[Planet|planets]] with [[Magnetic|magnetic]] poles and arctic circles. He only has any influence at all on the areas north of each world's arctic circle; in the south, he can only stay very briefly and holds no influence. Whether he is able to visit only planets with arctic circles, or whether the arctic circles exist due to Ithaqua's visits in their earliest days, is unclear.
> In his realm, Ithaqua often leaves behind rampant cannibalism and [[Wendigo|wendigos]] after his visits, and often abducts people to walk with him into the skies, and later fall to death or be transformed into a wendigo.


## Appearance

> Ithaqua appears as a 50-foot-tall [[Monstrous humanoid|monstrous humanoid]] with unnaturally long limbs. His webbed feet are always concealed in blasts of thick cold winds, and always leave behind monstrous tracks in the snow. Onlookers rarely remember his shape beyond his two glowing red eyes.


## Church of Ithaqua

> Ithaqua is primarily worshipped by cannibals, [[Giant|giants]], and [[Wendigo|wendigos]] in arctic regions. Worshippers fearful of starvation or the loss of morality might leave sacrifices to him in the highest boughs of a pine tree. Ithaqua is rarely worshipped south of the arctic circle.
