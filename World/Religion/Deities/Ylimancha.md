> **Ylimancha** is an [[Agathion|agathion]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] who watches over coastlines and protects those whose livelihood depends on the sea.

## Appearance

> Ylimancha has two forms: one of an [[Osprey|osprey]]-headed woman carrying a teak longbow strung with gold; and another of a [[Siren|siren]] with the body of a white seagull and the head of a [[Varisian]] crone with short dark hair. In both forms, she speaks with a voice carrying the echo of crashing waves.


## Relationships

> Since the dawn of time, Ylimancha has been fighting against [[Pazuzu]] over the [[Soul|souls]] of those that fly. She bitterly resents those races lost to his [[Evil|evil]] influence.


## Servants

> Ylimancha is served by many [[Chelonidal|chelonidals]], who are often front-line infantry in agathion armies.
