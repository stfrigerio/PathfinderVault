> **Sugroz** is a [[Velstrac demagogue|velstrac demagogue]] who takes the [[Velstrac|velstrac]] [[Philosophy|philosophy]] of cutting away imperfections to become perfect to an extreme. Except for lips to preach her voice and a mind to think, she sees a physical body as a distraction and seeks to free herself from it.


## On the Material Plane

> Sugroz oversees a multi-[[Planet|planet]]-based research operation dedicated to the creation of new types of velstracs from living [[Mortal|mortals]], as opposed to the [[Soul|souls]] of the [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|dead]]. This is done through traditional velstrac soul-warping techniques combined with advanced [[Technology|technologies]]. One branch of this operation is based in the Chapel of Rent Flesh in the [[Sellen Hills]] of [[Numeria]].
> The demagogue has been interested in [[Golarion]] for quite some time. In [[4051 AR]], she was drawn to the [[Hold of Belkzen]] by the tormented screams of dying [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] officers who had been impaled on a thorn tree by the forces of the warlord [[Kazavon]]. Entranced by their suffering, she transformed the tree into a [[Magic|magical]] [[Portal|portal]] known as an [[Irminsul|irminsul]], linking it forever to an unknown [[Demiplane|demiplane]] of suffering. The site is now known as the [[Battle of Screaming Tree]] and is even avoided by the fearless [[Orc|orcs]] who prowl those plains.
