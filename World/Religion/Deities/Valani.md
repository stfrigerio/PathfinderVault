> Where the [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azata]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] **Valani** (pronounced wah-LAH-nee) touches the world, verdant land springs forth. His acts teach [[Mortal|mortals]] that although the world is an abundant place fit for man's growth, through nature's force nothing lasts forever; growth requires destruction so [[Good|good]] can take root in once-[[Evil|evil]] soil. He is renowned for his short temper, but many of his peers respect his mastery over nature.



## Home

> Valani's home lies deep in the Bright-Burning Volcano in [[Elysium]].


## Appearance

> Valani is a muscular, [[Boar|boar]]-headed, ten-foot-tall figure, with a primate's thick limbs, long dark hair, and ruddy dark brown skin. He wears a crown of spiked grass and purple flowers, and an ornate suit of [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] made from shells and obsidian. His expression contorts into awful rage when he is angered. It is said that his laugh can bend trees and his roar of wrath splits the ground under him.


## Cults

> Valani is known as a proud, wise father, and many island-dwelling tribes across the [[Great Beyond]] claim to be his blessed children.
> Followers of Valani are travelers and mercurial in nature. There is no formal church but worshipers most commonly congregate on beaches for nightly bonfires filled with dance and revelry. Shell necklaces, often adorned with a pearl in its center, are popular amongst his faithful.
