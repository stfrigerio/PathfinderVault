> **Rowdrosh** is an [[Agathion|agathion]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]], the patron of herd [[Animal|animals]]. He is credited with teaching them how to travel together to protect themselves from predators.



## Home

> Rowdrosh raises [[Celestial|celestial]] mounts for heroes on [[Nirvana]] but has no permanent home, preferring to wander the [[Plane|planes]] with his herd.


## Appearance

> Rowdrosh is a muscular, [[Ram|ram]]-headed man with tanned skin. Bronze hair covers his face, shoulders, and chest. His massive curled horns are made of moonstone, and he carries them with ease. He carries a birch staff in his left hand that hits as hard as [[Iron|iron]]. He can also take the form of a herd animal, and often travels the [[Material Plane]] in this guise.


## Cults

> Rowdrosh is worshipped by animal herders, and his agents teach them of how to properly care for pregnant or [[Diseases of Golarion|diseased]] ones. He despises [[Worg|worgs]] and [[Schir|schirs]], and his servants put great effort into hunting these monsters down.
