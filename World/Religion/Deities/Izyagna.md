> **Izyagna** is a [[Demon lordNascent demon lord|nascent demon lord]] suborned to the goddess [[Lamashtu]], and resides in the slums of the city of Yanaron in Lamashtu's [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Kurnugia]]. She simultaneously inhabits seven different bodies, controlled by a single hive intelligence. Each of these takes the form of a terrifying ant-like creature, but can also transform into one of the seven major humanoid races of [[Golarion]]: [[Human|human]], [[Elf|elf]], [[Dwarf|dwarf]], [[Gnome|gnome]], [[Halfling|halfling]], [[Half-elf|half-elf]], and [[Half-orc|half-orc]]. She also has power over swarms.
> Izyagna's unholy symbol is a circle made up of seven ants biting each other's back left leg.


## Relationships


### Deskari

> The full [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Deskari]] maintains a rivalry with Izyagna presumably associated with their insect-oriented portfolios. As Izyagna serves Lamashtu, this rivalry has never escalated due to Deskari's reluctance to invoke the wrath of the Mother of Monsters.
