> **Yog-Sothoth** is the [[Outer God]] of gates, space, and [[Time|time]]. One of the most powerful and enigmatic [[Deity|deities]] of the [[Great Beyond]], he is said to be a terrible, self-aware manifestation of the [[Dimension of Time]], or even the [[Dark Tapestry]].



## Appearance and existence

> Being a manifestation of the Dimension of Time, Yog-Sothoth is coterminous with all of space and time and can exist in multiple times and places at once, but it seems that either he cannot properly intrude upon the [[Material Plane]] unless [[Summon|summoned]]; or perhaps he can but has no reason to do so. When he does so, Yog-Sothoth appears as a congeries of iridescent spheres, a conglomeration of glowing balls of various sizes and colors, or as the Lurker at the Threshold, a mass of endlessly writhing and growing black tentacles. In both forms, Yog-Sothoth wreaks incredible havoc when summoned.
> The *[[Windsong Testaments]]* refers to Yog-Sothoth as the **Watcher** and one of the two anchors of each incarnation of creation, alongside a Survivor from the previous multiverse, currently [[Pharasma]]. Between Pharasma and Yog-Sothoth, the [[Age of Creation]] began with the birth of the Great Beyond.
> Yog-Sothoth has been variously described by the [[Old Cults]] as a being that dwells within the Dark Tapestry; the Dark Tapestry itself; or a sapient embodiment of the Material Plane.


## Servants

> The [[Great Old One]] [[Tawil at'Umr|Tawil atUmr]] serves as the physical projection of Yog-Sothoth's will and pursues his goals across the [[Dimension|dimensions]]. It is theorised that Tawil at'Umr is little more than the side effect of Yog-Sothoth brushing up against the Material Plane.


## Church of Yog-Sothoth

> The cult of Yog-Sothoth is not an organised religion. Worshipers of Yog-Sothoth tend to be isolated and often [[Insane|insane]] [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]], such as [[Alchemist|alchemists]], [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]], and [[Wizard|wizards]], searching for hidden eldritch secrets and hoping that Yog-Sothoth will reveal these mysteries to them in exchange for their worship. Other common worshipers are cults comprised almost exclusively of [[Witch|witches]]. They believe that Yog-Sothoth will grant them great power, and that his increasing intrusions are a sign that he is taking an active interest in [[Golarion]]. All are prone to bicker and fight among each other as much as they fight with others.
> Yog-Sothoth's followers believe that he is preparing for the awakening of the Great Old Ones on various [[Planet|planets]], whose inhabitants will be wiped out to make way for the true masters. Cultists often call upon him to 'bless' pregnant women, leading to the birth of [[Child of Yog-Sothoth|children]] and [[Spawn of Yog-Sothoth|spawn of Yog-Sothoth]] that shall prepare the world for when the [[Star|stars]] are right and the Great Old Ones rule again.
> Some others worship Yog-Sothoth as a deity of time and space, and have called upon him in order to learn about or travel to distant places or times. They describe him as a non-[[Evil|evil]] guardian of the secrets of the cosmos' true nature who reveals them to those who ask, yet the very act of interacting with Yog-Sothoth is dangerous to one's life and sanity.
> Ultimately, Yog-Sothoth cares little for mortal worship, as he has no real need of it except for one purpose: worshipers who will either directly summon him into [[Solar system|Golarions realm of existence]] themselves, or who will mate with him to produce a [[Spawn of Yog-Sothoth|spawn of Yog-Sothoth]] or [[Child of Yog-Sothoth|child of Yog-Sothoth]] who will summon its progenitor instead. Once summoned to [[Golarion]] (or any other [[Planet|world]], for that matter), Yog-Sothoth would be free to ravage the surrounding area and consume any and all lifeforms he can reach, corrupting the very space and time he touches with his foul and unnatural presence.
