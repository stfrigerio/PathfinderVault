> Ancient **Cthulhu** is the most powerful of the [[Demigod|demigods]] known as the [[Great Old One|Great Old Ones]], and is regarded as the [[Herald|herald]] of the [[Outer God|Outer Gods]].



## Home

> For now, dead Cthulhu lies asleep in the corpse city of [[R'lyeh|Rlyeh]] on a [[Earth|distant world]] far from [[Golarion]], held in stasis by powerful [[Magic|magic]] and the power of the *[[Nethys/Artifacts/Elder Sign]]*, but he can reach across the voids of space to touch the sleeping minds of [[Mortal|mortals]] (usually half-[[Insanity|insane]] creative minds like poets, [[Art|artists]] and visionaries), who dream of madness and wake with memories not wholly theirs, sometimes not even realising that they are being influenced. His cult is spread in this manner.


## Appearance

> Cthulhu resembles a massive [[Humanoid|humanoid]] with an [[Octopus|octopoid]] face, immense [[Dragon|draconic]] wings, and foul, protoplasmic, writhing flesh. His exact form is somewhat fluid, and he stands more than 100 feet tall.


## Servants

> Cthulhu is served by the [[Star-spawn of Cthulhu|star-spawn]], which share Cthulhu's shape and purpose. Though smaller and weaker than their master, they still possess tremendous power.


## Worshipers

> Cthulhu is worshipped by various aquatic races, those dwelling near coasts, and those driven to madness by haunted dreams. They are careful to hide their faith and only meet in barely trodden places, infecting others with terrible visions of their master rising from his sunken city. They know that when the stars are right, R'lyeh will rise again, and it will be only a matter of time before their master arrives on Golarion and wipes it clean to prepare for the Outer Gods' return. They believe that their obeisance will cause Cthulhu to reward then, but in truth Cthulhu is unlikely to notice them at all. Cthulhu's temples are stark, cyclopean, monolithic buildings, but since most of his worshippers lack the resources to build them, they usually make do with simple hidden shrines.


### Unholy symbol

> Cthulhu's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a complex [[Rune|rune]] surrounding an open eye.
