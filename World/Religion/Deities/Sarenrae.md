>  Known to her faithful as the Dawnflower, the Healing Flame, and the Everlight, **Sarenrae** (pronounced SAER-en-ray) is a [[goddess]] who teaches temperance and patience in all things. Compassion and peace are her greatest virtues, and if enemies of the faith can be redeemed, they should be.



## Dogma

![[Prismatic_Ray.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Sarenrae (foreground) relaxes with [[Shelyn]] and [[Desna]].
>  Yet there are those who have no interest in redemption, who glory in slaughter and death. From the remorseless [[Evil]] of the [[Undead]] and [[fiends]], to the cruelties born in the hearts of mortals, Sarenrae's doctrines preach swift justice delivered by the [[scimitar's]] edge. To this end, she expects her faithful to be skilled at swordplay, both as a form of martial art promoting centering of mind and body, and so that when they do enter battle, their foes do not suffer any longer than necessary.


## History

>  According to the teachings of the followers of [[Asmodeus]] (whose motives should always be questioned), Sarenrae is one of the oldest gods in existence, having been created by [[Ihys]], one of the two primordial deities in the time before time. She comforted Ihys when his brother Asmodeus castigated him for giving free will to mortals. Sarenrae served as Ihys's right hand in the first war between the gods, when the gods of chaos (led by Ihys) clashed with the gods of law (led by Asmodeus). In a rage, Sarenrae confronted Asmodeus when the Prince of Darkness slew Ihys and was nearly killed, but Asmodeus realized that he could never quench her resolution and that his battle was hopeless. He then abandoned the war and retreated to [[Hell]]. According to the *[[Windsong Testaments]]*, Sarenrae was one of the first eight deities of this incarnation of the [[multiverse]]. She marvelled at the [[stars]] created by [[Desna]], and chose some of them to give life so creation could begin.
>  Near the end of the [[Age of Creation]], when [[Rovagug]] descended upon the [[Material Plane]] to wreak havoc, Sarenrae took note and called upon an alliance of gods to oppose him. During this magnificent war of prehistory, the Dawnflower cast down Rovagug to the [[Dead Vault]] at the center of [[Golarion]]. It is believed that after Asmodeus bound the Rough Beast there, Sarenrae placed therein the raging flames of the [[Sun]] as an eternal torment. Sarenrae repaired the gash in the earth and commanded her followers to avoid the smooth scar that remained.
>  During the [[Age of Anguish]], her faithful living in nearby [[Ninshabur]] misinterpreted her instructions, however, and instead flocked to the area, eventually founding the settlement of [[Gormuz]] there. Believing Gormuz to be a holy city of Sarenrae, people from all over [[Casmaron]] flocked there for millennia, but were slowly corrupted by the imprisoned god Rovagug's dreams. Sarenrae continued sending portents and visions to her faithful in Gormuz during this period, but they were ignored or misinterpreted. She finally sent her [[Herald]] [[Kohal]] to the people of Gormuz in [[-3923 AR]], but they had been so corrupted that they destroyed him instead. In great wrath, Sarenrae was tricked by Rovagug into smiting Gormuz with her scimitar, destroying it completely, and created an enormous rent in the earth that eventually became known as the [[Pit of Gormuz]]. Upon seeing that her mistake had excavated Rovagug's prison and allowed all kinds of monsters, including [[Ulunat]], the first [[Spawn of Rovagug]], to disgorge themselves on Golarion's surface, Sarenrae learnt a valuable lesson in espousing redemption over wrath.


## Home

>  Sarenrae's realm of Everlight appears as a sun hanging at high noon in the sky of [[Nirvana]]. Her servitors gather there to plan their crusades without fear of espionage, as those who seek do do [[Evil]] are banned from the realm. Sarenrae occasionally takes [[Human]] form to walk the streets of [[High Ninshabur]], learning from the less fortunate and reminding herself of her responsibility to care for the [[Great Beyond]].


## Appearance

![[Sarenrae.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A common depiction of the Dawnflower.
>  Sarenrae manifests as a bronze angelic beauty with golden hair composed of flowing flame. She emits a holy light which trickles down like liquid luminescence from one hand, while the other holds a scimitar emblazoned with radiant fire. Her holy light provides healing and sustenance, while the scimitar creates gusts of winds that remove disease and fear.


## Relationships

>  Sarenrae counts all non-evil gods as her companions, and even communicates with evil deities in the hopes of converting them from their dark ways, although certain tradition-bound deities like [[Torag]] distrust the Dawnflower and her flock, seeing their willingness to forgive as a weakness. She is known to be in a polyamorous relationship with [[Desna]] and [[Shelyn]].
>  While Sarenrae believes in redemption, she understands that certain beings are irredeemable, including her only true enemy Rovagug and ironically Asmodeus, who once worked with her to imprison Rovagug. Sarenrae's hope that their cooperation would lead him to redemption never came to pass, and now she regards Asmodeus in the same category as Rovagug. Their rivalry goes much farther than their constant battle over [[souls]].


## Providence

>  Sarenrae shows her approval by sending [[doves]], or the unusual appearance of ankhs. She indicates her disfavor through unexplained sunburns or blindness that can last from minutes for minor transgressions to an entire lifetime for the worst offenses.


## Servants

>  Sarenrae has numerous [[angelic]] servants. Among these are her [[divine servitors]], the [[Yhohm]], who are said to be born from a portion of [[phoenixes']] [[souls]] every time they are reborn in fire.

## Church of Sarenrae

>  The church of Sarenrae is mostly composed of altruistic priests who are also ready to be stern should it be warranted. The church is known for blessing crops, healing the sick, and reforming criminals and evil doers. They are often consulted to solve feuds and disputes among neighbors and families. The [[Empire of Kelesh]] holds her as their patron deity and is responsible for spreading her faith throughout the [[Inner Sea region]]. Here she is worshiped primarily in [[Absalom]], [[Katapesh]], [[Osirion]], [[Taldor]], [[Thuvia]], and of course [[Qadira]], and among [[Garundi (human ethnicity)|Garundi]], [[Keleshites]], [[Taldans]], [[Varisians]], [[halflings]], and [[half-elves]] throughout the [[Inner Sea region]].
>  The [[Cult of the Dawnflower]] is a militant sect of the church that is popular and influential in Osirion and Qadira.
>  Kind and caring halflings often worship Sarenrae, tending to the sick and elderly. Rarely, a halfling may be born with red hair and, as this is seen by halflings as a sign from the goddess, these halflings are expected to become part of Sarenrae's clergy. Sarenrae is also one of the most popular deities worshipped by the strange planar race known as [[duskwalkers]].
>  [[Knights]] of Sarenrae identify themselves by wearing white scarves around their helms and wielding the scimitar. They are willing to offer mercy to those enemies who seek absolution and renounce evil.


### Clergy

*See also: [[Dawnflower dissident]]*
>  A large portion of Sarenrae's priests are composed of [[clerics]], but within their ranks are also [[paladins]] and [[rangers]], as well as a few [[druids]] and [[bards]]. Some priests work as personal retainers or healers for the wealthy, while others survive on assistance from congregational worshipers. A common form of worship by priests is to awaken with the dawn and give thanks and praise to the rising sun. The scimitar is a favored weapon and its use is held in high regard, and it is often decorated with sunburst images in red and gold. In battle, Sarenrae's clerics become dervishes, ready to destroy irredeemable corruption. Formal raiments include a long white chasuble and tunic with red and gold decorations depicting the sun. Worship leaders often wear a golden crown topped by a red-gold sunburst.


### Temples and shrines

>  The main temples of the Dawnflower are open-air buildings, although side buildings have ceilings. Many have brass or gold mirrors that refocus the sunlight on the main altar. Priests often travel from one temple to the next. The [[Everlight Oasis]] in Kelesh is a popular site of pilgrimage for followers of the goddess. Church services are held outdoors and are joyous affairs that feature singing, dancing, and music.


### Holy texts

>  *The Birth of Light and Truth* is the principal holy book of Sarenrae. It is customary for every owner of this book to inscribe her own uplifting stories in the last few blank pages, so that they can be recounted to others later.


### Church history

>  The peoples of the Inner Sea region did not always worship Sarenrae. Her faith spread along the Keleshite trade routes during the early years of the [[Age of Enthronement]], touching off much instability in Garund.


### Holidays

>  The most commonly celebrated [[holidays]] celebrated by the followers of Sarenrae are [[Burning Blades]] on the 10th of [[Sarenith]], and the [[Sunwrought Festival]], held on the [[summer solstice]]. The month of Sarenith is named in her honor.


### Dawnflower anchorites

***Main article: [[Dawnflower anchorite]]***
>  The Dawnflower anchorite travels throughout the wilderness, fighting [[Evil]] and offering redemption, while devoting herself to the greatest of Sarenrae's blessings: the sun.
>  Anchorites focus their studies on a personal credence through which they develop and express their faith, whether it takes the form of generating magical light or flaming [[weapons]].


### Favored animals

>  Gods are often associated with certain [[Animals]], either because they possess a quality favored by the god, or because the god's faithful feel a special kinship to them. Sarenrae's favored animals include the [[dove]], the [[falcon]], and [[basking lizards]].


## Organizations

>  The Dawn Vigil is a small band of Sarenite paladins who guard the Katapeshi town of [[Solku]] from [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll]] attacks.
