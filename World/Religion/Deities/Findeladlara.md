> **Findeladlara** is the [[Elf|elven]] goddess of [[Art|art]] and architecture. She believes in preserving tradition and prefers innovation over the creation of something entirely new. She actively supports the preservation of elven culture through the protection of their art and historic buildings. While Findeladlara is a [[Good|good]] goddess, she often comes off as aloof, particularly to younger, non-elven races. She is known to judge their work harshly and never answers the prayers of a non-elf.



## Appearance

> When shown in art, she appears as a beautiful elven woman in traditional elven dress. She is normally depicted standing beneath an archway of either [[Mithral|mithral]] or branches, whilst being illuminated by the setting [[Sun|sun]]. Her [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] is a hand pointing upward suspending a golden [[Star|star]] or flame.


## Relationships

> Devotees of Findeladlara occasionally come into conflict with those of [[Shelyn]]. While the latter encourages innovation among artists, the former scoffs at the achievements of those who have not already mastered the traditional elven crafts. Even though there is no overt hostility between these groups, each believes that the other is misguided and wasting their potential.


## Church of Findeladlara

> Priests of the Guiding Hand often craft their own [[Quarterstaff|quarterstaves]], capping them with [[Silver|silver]] and decorating them with precious [[Gem|gems]] and crystals.
