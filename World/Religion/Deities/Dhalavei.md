> **Dhalavei** is the [[Deity|goddess]] of unmaking and secrets. Her sole design seems to be the fragmenting of bonds, trust, and the destruction of the universe, though mediated by an obsession with planning and organization. Her three aspects as worshiped by her most important sect, the [[Cult of the Ebon Destroyers cult|Cult of the Ebon Destroyers]], are mysteries, deception, and black destruction.



## Appearance

> Dhalavei appears as beautiful three-headed woman with deep black skin and dark hair. She has two arms, but at the elbow they branch into three lower arms. In her hands she holds a [[Temple sword|temple sword]], noose, an orb of darkness, and a [[Scroll|scroll]], still sealed.


## History

> The cult of Dhalavei claims origins from the [[Age of Darkness]]. Despite the [[Evil|evil]] it works, all efforts to stamp it out have failed. Her believers have historically managed to seize power in several kingdoms which they once openly bent to her worship, and are strongest in [[Vudra]].


## Relationships

> Despite her alignment, Dhalavei is sometimes worshipped alongside other members of the [[Vudran pantheon]] such as [[Irori]].


## Servants

> Among her known supplicants are the [[Asura|asura]] called the [[Upasunda|beatific ones]].


## Church of Dhalavei

> Worshippers of Dhalavei believe she protects her faithful even as she destroys all others. Her followers include spies, [[Monk|monks]], and political figures. [[Vampire|Vampires]] occasionally worship her as well. Many of her worshipers are of the lower castes. As part of their rites, her clergy conduct [[Human|human]] sacrifices. The bodies of those slain are carefully hidden.


### Unholy Symbol

> Dhalavei's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is six feminine arms forming a hexagon shape: the six forearms form the hexagon's edges; while the six upper arms form the spokes that meet in a brightly patterned hub.


### Holidays

> The [[Moon|new moon]] and eclipses are celebrated as especially propitious times for human sacrifices to the dark goddess.
