> **Feronia** is a little-known, rarely-seen [[Demigod|demigoddess]], native to the [[Plane of Fire]].



## Home

> Feronia lives with her children in the Cradle of Flames, a commune situated high atop a huge, intricate, obsidian spire on the Plane of Fire.


## Appearance

> Feronia's natural appearance is that of a massive, amorphous flame shot with shining [[Gold|gold]]. She often takes the form of a beautiful, black-skinned woman with molten eyes, a swan made of flames, or a [[Phoenix|phoenix]] crowned with gold and sapphire.


## Servants

> Feronia is served by four phoenixes, who protect the Cradle of Flames under the command of her herald, the Guardian Blaze.


## Relationships

> Feronia has given birth to numerous children with different fathers throughout the millennia, and has thwarted numerous plots to kidnap or harm them. Feronia rebuffs all potential suitors that come to the Cradle of Flames, as she prefers to meet them on her own terms by [[Magic|magically]] travelling to their realms.
> Feronia's most famous child is the [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] [[Ragathiel]], the product of a short marriage (lasting only a few centuries) with the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Dispater]]. After their divorce, she took the baby Ragathiel out of [[Hell]]. Feronia and Dispater remain on friendly terms, and correspond once a year, but out of respect for Dispater's current wife, [[Erecura]], they never meet in person.
