>  **Yuelral** is the [[elven]] [[goddess]] of [[Magic]]. She is a patron of both [[divine]] and [[arcane]] magic, but prefers magic that deals with the natural world rather than magic that deals with [[metal]] and other artificial things. She is frequently worshiped by jewelers because of her affinity with crystals. These jewelers never cut their crystals, instead embracing their natural beauty. Yuelral is quick to embrace [[half elves]], seeing past their mixed heritage to what lies within.


## Appearance

>  In elven [[Art]], Yuelral is always shown as an elven woman in normal, simple dress. She has wise eyes and is surrounded by orbiting magical crystals much like ioun stones. Her [[holy symbol]] comprises three crystals of pink, blue and green overlapping in the middle to form a six-pointed [[star]] shape surrounded by a [[golden]] circle.
