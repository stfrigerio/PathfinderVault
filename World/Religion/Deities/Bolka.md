> **Bolka** is the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] goddess of marriage. She is the daughter of the dwarven god [[Torag]] and his wife [[Folgrit]]. Bolka is said to be a beautiful dwarven maiden. As the dwarves' goddess of marriage she helps reluctant suitors summon the courage to ask out their partner and helps foster love between the partners in an arranged marriage.


## Church of Bolka

> There's a tradition of hiding wedding rings and other wedding gifts in secret compartments in conference rooms near the chapel. This is done with the belief that this will strengthen the associated wedding.
