> **Jaidi** is a [[Deity|goddess]] of agriculture worshiped by the people of [[Azlant|ancient Azlant]]. She represents the pleasure that one feels when contributing hard work for the community as a whole.



## History


> Jaidi taught agriculture to the ancient Azlanti, allowing them to sustain millions of citizens.


## Relationships

> Jaidi is married to [[Erastil]], and their children are the [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lords]] [[Halcamora]] and [[Cernunnos]]. She was opposed to [[Lissala]], because she thought Lissala treated hard work as nothing more than toil born of obligation or greed. Due to Jaidi's focus on agriculture and self-sufficiency, which form the basis for a strong community, she often confers with [[Kazutal]].


## Church of Jaidi


### Worshipers and clergy

> Jaidi was one of the most ancient Azlanti gods: shrines carved with her [[Holy symbol|holy symbols]], dating back millennia, had been found during the empire's height. Her followers, consisting mostly of traders and farmers, enjoyed contributing their hard work to the good of the community. After [[Earthfall]], it is said that some of her followers attempted to restore the land with the techniques she taught them. Due to Earthfall's fallout, their success was limited, but their dedication to hard work gave fellow survivors the strength they needed to endure the [[Age of Darkness]]. In modern times, Jaidi is only worshipped by small communities scattered across [[Golarion]].


### Temples and shrines

> Cooks that worshipped Jaidi often maintained small shrines dedicated to her in their kitchens.
