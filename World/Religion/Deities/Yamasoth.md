> **Yamasoth** is a [[Qlippoth lord|qlippoth lord]], yet many scholars persist with the notion that Yamasoth is actually a [[Nascent demon lord|nascent demon lord]], maybe the only [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] currently at that rank in the [[Abyss|Abyssal]] hierarchy. This is wrong, and Yamasoth himself is angry at this misrepresentation.



## Background

> Yamasoth is possibly the original qlippoth that was experimented upon, leading to the genesis of [[Demon|demonkind]]; his vile experimentation on victim creatures is used as evidence of this.
> Yamasoth's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a jagged circle containing three eyes and six spiralling arms radiating out from its edge.


## Home

> Yamasoth rules over the Kingdom of New Flesh, a large part of the [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Sekatar-Seraktis]]. Thirteen other powerful demons war over the control of this realm but seem to leave Yamasoth to his experiments.
> The Kingdom of New Flesh is home to hundreds of thousands of his test subjects, which Yamasoth collected from various [[Planet|planets]] and transformed into twisted monsters via [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]]. None remembers their name or personality. [[Gongorinan|Gongorinans]], Yamasoth's favoured qlippoth, serve as functionaries and defend the Kingdom of New Flesh.


## Appearance

> More evidence of a qlippoth nature is in Yamasoth's bizarre appearance: a basis of an [[Octopus|octopus]] or large [[Squid|squid]] is perverted by extra tentacles and eyes. A large mouth contains an extra eye in the throat, which only opens in combat to release a gaze attack turning victims wild and monstrous. A common factor in his physical make up is the ability to cause pain: teeth, stinging tongues, and the termination of every tentacle with each one boasting a different way of inflicting pain.


## On Golarion

> Yamasoth once inhabited the realm of [[Gongorina]], in the deepest parts of [[Sekamina]] in the [[Darklands]], directly below the [[Varisian Gulf]]. This was his [[Laboratory|laboratory]] on [[Golarion]], where he experimented on [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]] from [[Kuvhoshik]], [[Drider|driders]] from [[Umberweb]], and other creatures from the surface. From Gongorina, Yamasoth had tunnels that ran to the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] city of [[Xin-Bakrakhan]] at [[Hollow Mountain]] and to Sekatar-Seraktis. This latter tunnel still exists, though Yamasoth no longer travels to Gongorina. [[Alaznist]], the final [[Runelords|runelord of wrath]], was allied to Yamasoth when the qlippoth lord lived in Gongorina: she provided him with test subjects and he bolstered her armies with his creations. It is believed that if [[Earthfall]] had never happened, Yamasoth would have launched a massive qlippoth invasion of Golarion, but the devastation wrought by Earthfall forced him to return to the Abyss.


### Relationships

> Yamasoth despises almost all other [[Deity|deities]]. He both disdains and grudgingly respects [[Lamashtu]], both for her creation of various monsters and her status as the strongest [[Demon lord|demon lord]]. Followers of Lamashtu and Yamasoth might cooperate when conducting experiments on unwilling subjects, but almost always turn on each other.
> Yamasoth abhors [[Haagenti]]: both claim to be the original inventor of fleshwarping and considers the other a plagiariser. Their worshippers rarely clash, since Yamasoth's cult is concentrated on the surface of Golarion, while Haagenti's [[Drow|drow]] followers usually live in the Darklands.
