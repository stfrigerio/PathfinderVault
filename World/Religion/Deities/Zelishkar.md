> **Zelishkar of the Bitter Flame** is a [[Harbinger|harbinger]] (a [[Daemon|daemonic]] [[Demigod|demigod]] capable of granting [[Divine magic|divine magic]] to worshippers) who serves the [[Four Horsemen|archdaemon]] [[Szuriel]].



## History

> Zelishkar was forged by Szuriel in the [[Cinder Furnace]] as the embodiment of the funeral pyres that burn those killed in the wars she brings. His prowess eventually convinced Szuriel to promote him, and now he embodies all hateful, sadistic purposes of fire.


## Appearance

> Zelishkar is shaped like a monstrous three-tongued [[Cat|feline]] figure made of crimson flames, surrounded by a heat shimmer that diffuses the light. He wears a crest and an obsidian, razor-thin, preternaturally durable cuirass. His eyes are jet black and emit a sinister orange glow.


## Cults

> Zelishkar is worshipped by arsonists and torturers who burn their prisoners alive. He silently feasts on the hatred of those who would want the world to burn, even if they never actually speak his name.


### Unholy symbol

> Zelishkar's [[Holy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a pair of crossed pikes over a pyre.


## On Golarion

> In [[-3070 AR]], the [[Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues]] [[Summon|summoned]] Zelishkar to [[Osirion]], where he led his flaming minions against Osirion's enemies, most notably the [[Jistka Imperium]]. After several successful campaigns, the pharaoh built the [[Labyrinth of Shiman-Sekh]] south of the [[Alamein Peninsula]], and summoned an entire [[Genie|genie]] army to imprison Zelishkar there in order to prove the infallibility of his maze. With the aid of an ancient [[Efreeti|efreeti]], Zelishkar and his minions were defeated and imprisoned in the [[Artifact|artifact]] known as the *[[Bottle of the Bound]]*.
> In [[-2044 AR]], [[An-Hepsu XI]] freed Zelishkar, with the help of Szuriel, in order to burn down a flying [[Shory Empire|Shory]] city. After that, he destroyed several cities and oases in western Osirion before being re-imprisoned in the [[Labyrinth of Shiman-Sekh]], where he is said to reside to this day. This act is said to be An-Hepsu XI's greatest error.
