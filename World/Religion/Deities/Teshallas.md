> **Teshallas** is an agender [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp usher]] who embodies ageing. Teshallas' touch—age—robs [[Mortality|mortals]] of memory, passion, and vitality until death comes to claim them, but Teshallas' touch also allows mortals to mature and can bring them new understanding that they failed to grasp in their youth.



## History

> When [[Pharasma]] saw that mortals were unwilling to let go of life when their time came, she transformed an [[Asp|asp]] into Teshallas, whose figurative venom (ageing) would eventually cause mortals to welcome death. Because of this, Teshallas is sometimes cursed and regarded as an example of Pharasma's cruel indifference.


## Home

> Teshallas' home is the greenhouse known as the Bower Antimony, and they often leave their home to wander the [[Ethereal Plane]].


## Appearance

> Teshallas resembles a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake]] eating their own tail, with four feathered wings not connected to their body.


## Cults

> Teshallas is the patron of those who refine natural [[Poisons of Golarion|poisons]] into [[Medicine|medicine]], who often grow small gardens of poisonous [[Plant|plants]] to honour their patron. Teshallas is also associated with intelligent reptiles, such as [[Kobold|kobolds]], [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], and [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]], whose [[Soul|souls]] Teshallas manages.
