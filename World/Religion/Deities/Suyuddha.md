> One of thousands of deities worshiped by the [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]], Suyuddha is the patron goddess of the elite [[Padaprajna|padaprajna]] caste of warriors.  She is commonly known as the Warrior Queen, primarily due to her emphasis on cunning and tactical warfare.  Unlike many gods of war, she is not herself a battler, but rather a tactician and planner of complicated martial strategy.  Many stories of her victories and exploits can be found in the holy pages of the *[[List of written worksMizravrtta Brahmodya|Mizravrtta Brahmodya]]*.
