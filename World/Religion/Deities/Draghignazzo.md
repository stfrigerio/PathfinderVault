> **Draghignazzo**, the [[Devil|devil]]-[[Dragon|dragon]] of devastation, inhabits a mighty castle which serves as the shared realm of himself and his brother, fellow [[Malebranche|malebranche]] [[Scarmiglione]]. He is said to long for [[Hell]] as he sleeps amid a completed conquest, while his brother lures in unwitting travellers to feed him.
