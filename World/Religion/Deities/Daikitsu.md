> It is not surprising that the [[Tian Xia]] [[Deity|goddess]] **Daikitsu** is a common object of veneration given that she has the everyday subjects of rice, agriculture, and craftsmanship under her divine purview.



## Appearance

> Daikitsu appears as a beautiful [[Kitsune|kitsune]] woman with snow-white fur and nine tails.


## Holy symbol

> Daikitsu's [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] is that of a nine-tailed [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fox|fox]].


## Relationships

> [[Nalinivati]], the patron goddess of [[Naga|nagas]] and the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake]]-like [[Humanoid|humanoids]] known as the [[Nagaji|nagaji]], has been romantically linked with the Daikitsu, although both deities deny this claim.


## Church of Daikitsu

> Daikitsu is widely venerated across Tian Xia as her role as a goddess of rice and agriculture ensures many seek her favour. Farmers seek her blessing to ensure fertile fields and good harvests; smiths and craftsmen worship her aspect as a patron of artifice; and families pray to her for safety. Daikitsu is also worshipped as the patron of the kitsune people and has many followers amongst them.
> While worshipped across Tian Xia, Daikitsu's largest centres of worship are: within the [[Forest of Spirits]], where many kitsune reside; the [[Samurai|samurai]] nation of [[Minkai]]; and [[Shokuro]] that used to serve as the breadbasket of the former empire of [[Lung Wa]].
