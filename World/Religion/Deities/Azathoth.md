> **Azathoth**, also known as the **Blind Formless Chaos That Lies Behind the Stars**, the '**blind idiot god'**, the **Daemon Sultan**, or the **Primal Chaos**, is a little-known, inscrutable, all-powerful [[Outer God]] described as a gibbering mass of uncontrollable destructive power at the center of the [[Material Plane|universe]]. An utterly mindless being, Azathoth is totally unaware of the cosmos, including its own existence and worshippers.



## Home

> Within the [[Dark Tapestry]] (the darkness between the [[Star|stars]] where inhabitants of [[Golarion]] believe true [[Madness|madness]] lies), Azathoth's home is at the centre of the [[Material Plane]], and some scholars view this as proof that the Primal Chaos is the source of everything in existence. A mysterious coterie of an unknown number of powerful lesser [[Deity|gods]], known as Azathoth's Court, orbit Azathoth like [[Planet|planets]] orbit a [[Star|sun]], singing mad songs while listening to Azathoth's gibberish. Many of Azathoth's followers view these entities to be the true manifestation of its will. The greatest among them is [[Nyarlathotep]], the Crawling Chaos.


## Appearance

> Azathoth is a gibbering mass of destruction as large as a star.


## Church of Azathoth

> Despite Azathoth's seeming indifference to everything, including any folk mad enough to worship Azathoth, the Primal Chaos does have cultists. These are often power seekers wanting the destructive force of Azathoth to work for them and their schemes, but this is a perilous endeavour easily prone to backfire, as Azathoth does not care about anything else and its tiniest thrashings can destroy planets.
> The worship of Azathoth is largely undocumented among [[Human|humans]] in modern times, although some [[Cloaker|cloaker]] and [[Neothelid|neothelid]] communities worship it.


### Unholy symbol

> Azathoth's [[Holy symbol|unholy symbol]] is an eight-pointed star.


## On Golarion

> In the early years of the [[Age of Destiny]], Azathoth was worshipped by small groups in the [[Shory Empire]], who are said to have developed ways to harness its power; however, in the end, tampering with such powers only led to the empire's fall. Azathoth is indirectly linked to the destruction of the flying Shory city of [[Ulduvai]]. Cultists of Azathoth were contacted to help unlock the mysteries of a recently discovered [[Artifact|artifact]] known as the *shoggoth stone*. Upon activation, the *shoggoth stone* summoned a [[Shoggoth|shoggoth]] servant of Azathoth and transformed nearly the entire city into heaps of undulating, rotting viscera. The only temple to Azathoth on Golarion can still be found in the ruins of Ulduvai on the [[Shattered Range]] in southeastern [[Garund]].
> Azathoth's worship was also known amongst the [[Cyclops|cyclopes]] of ancient [[Ghol-Gan]] during the later period that marked their descent into barbarism and madness.
