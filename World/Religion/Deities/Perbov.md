> **Perbov** is a minor [[Giant|giant]] god thought to only be worshiped in the [[Iobaria|Iobarian]] city of [[Okormirr]]. The ruler of that settlement, [[Aalgin|Druid-King Aalgin]], requires all residents to swear fealty to Perbov, and he maintains that the nearby [[Lake of Mists and Veils]] is actually the god's sweat.
