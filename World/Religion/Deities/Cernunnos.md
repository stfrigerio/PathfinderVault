> **Cernunnos** is a mercurial [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azata]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] who embodies the wild and primeval force of nature. He stealthily ventures through the forests of the [[Great Beyond]], favouring decisive action to fight off the tide of [[Evil|evil]]. The Stag Lord aims to set right natural balances that are out of kilter and indulge in his passions.



## Home

> On [[Elysium]], Cernunnos lives in Briarbough, a sprawling palace of gardens and pools where [[Good|good]]-aligned individuals come to [[Heal|heal]] the wounded. In wars, it serves as a headquarters and hospital for the forces of good.


## Appearance

> Cernunnos presents himself as a muscular, tan-skinned [[Elf|elf]] with [[Stag|stag]] antlers and a piercing stare, clad in dull fur clothes that bear drawings of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]] in flight or leaping [[Animal|animals]].


## Relationships

> Cernunnos is the son of [[Erastil]] and [[Jaidi]], and the brother of [[Halcamora]]. He surrounds himself with advisors from all [[Celestial|celestial]] races, and works with them in the battle against evil.
> Though he rarely makes a rash decision, Cernunnos will sometimes let his anger overcome him, declare a personal vendetta against specific [[Demon lord|demon lords]] or [[Archdevil|archdevils]], and descend into [[Hell]] or the [[Abyss]] to exact revenge on them. He sometimes comes into conflict with [[Korada]], despite agreeing with him that even the most [[Evil|evil]] [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]] can find redemption, as Cernunnos believes that giving them time to do so will result in many lost lives.


## Church of Cernunnos

> Knowing that he is still one person despite his power, Cernunnos trains commanders and emissaries to fight evil in both the [[Material Plane]] and the [[First World]]. The faithful of Cernunnos are mainly intelligent [[Plant|plant]] creatures, [[Fey|fey]], and mortal [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]] and [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]]. [[Elf|Elves]] view him as patron of luck, while others pray to him for strength. Hidden groves, waterfalls, and deep forests are sacred to Cernunnos.
