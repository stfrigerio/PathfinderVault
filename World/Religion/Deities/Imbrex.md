> **Imbrex, the Twins** are two creatures hundreds of feet tall with reptilian [[Humanoid|humanoid]] features who resemble stone statues. They call themselves Imbrex and rank as one of the [[Eldest]]: divine [[Fey|fey]] creatures of tremendous power said to be able to reshape the very fabric of the [[First World]] on a whim. Whether the two parts of Imbrex are indeed akin to twin siblings has never been fathomed.



## Appearance

> Imbrex takes the form of two statues hundreds of feet high of identical, vaguely reptilian, androgynous humanoids. For as long as the statues have stood, they have never been seen moving, and communicate exclusively via [[Telepathy|telepathy]]. It is unknown if these statues are Imbrex's bodies or simply the home of their consciousness. Many First World residents believe that Imbrex will only deign to walk to unmake both the [[Material Plane]] and the First World and reset creation.


## Home

> The city of [[Anophaeus]], a resting place for pilgrims visiting them, sprawls around Imbrex's feet. Their dreams are strange, addictive and leak into the nearby areas, sometimes coalescing into physical form. Imbrex's reactions to threats to the city are seemingly random: sometimes invaders are all but ignored by Imbrex, but other times they are savaged with [[Psychic magic|psychic energy]].


## Cults

> Imbrex cares little about its worshippers, who can never predict how their prayers and questions would be answered, or how their actions will be rewarded or punished.


## Relationships

> Imbrex only confers frequently with [[Ragadahn]] and [[Magdh]] due to their shared interest in endings. It is rumoured that Imbrex was originally trapped in their current form by another Eldest or [[Deity|deity]], but they either care nothing about vengeance or have achieved it long ago.
