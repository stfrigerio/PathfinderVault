She serves as the messenger for qlippoth lords and often leads [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] invasions of [[Material Plane]] [[Planet|planets]] and [[Abyssal realm|Abyssal realms]] held by [[Demon|demons]]. The ground that she walks on becomes twisted and warped by the influence of the deep [[Abyss]].

She bestows forbidden [[Magic|magic]] on her xulgath followers, who believe that the false sun of Deep Tolguth will one day become a [[Portal|portal]] to her realm.
