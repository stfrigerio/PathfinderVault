> **The Lost Prince**, sometimes called the **Melancholy Lord**, is one of the [[Eldest]], a [[Deity|divine]] [[Fey|fey]] creature of tremendous power said to be able to reshape the very fabric of the [[First World]] on a whim. In looks, he is gaunt; in nature, he is dour and morose; in attitude, he tries to maintain a neutrality in all matters.



## History

> The Lost Prince is the only Eldest suspected not to be a native of the First World. No one knows his birthplace (speculated to be somewhere on the [[Material Plane]], a [[Demiplane|demiplane]] consumed by the [[Maelstrom]], or another reality entirely), why he left, and when and how he might return.


## Home

> The Lost Prince's realm is the Crumbling Tower, a place that has seen better days.


## Appearance

> The Lost Prince always appears as a gaunt, handsome, perpetually frowning [[Human|human]] man with black eyes, unruly black hair and dressed completely in black. A band of red symbols glows on his head, and a four-pointed star similarly glows on the back of each hand.


## Relationships

> The Lost Prince remains neutral with the other Eldest, who often make him the centre of their debates and schemes. His solemnity and knowledge are appreciated by [[Magdh]] and [[Shyka]], while [[The Lantern King|the Lantern King]] and [[Ragadahn]] cannot tolerate him. [[Ng]] sometimes visits the Lost Prince's library, with neither Eldest acknowledging the other. [[The Green Mother]] is romantically attracted to him, especially as he constantly refuses her advances. [[Imbrex]] is likely the Lost Prince's favourite peer, due to their stoicism and the Lost Prince's desire to be left alone.


## Church of the Lost Prince

> Although he appears disdainful of everyone else, including his own servants and followers, the Lost Prince usually secretly aids the depressed (particularly those who lost their homes and families), even if he never admits it. Because of this, despite his melancholy and apparent thanklessness, the Lost Prince counts many followers willing to defend their patron. They are at pains to discuss the Lost Prince's good works while drawing a gloss over his preferred method of maintaining neutrality in all things.
