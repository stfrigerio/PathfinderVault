> **Cyth-V'sug** (pronounced SITH-vih-SUG) is the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of fungus and parasites. Originally a [[Qlippoth lord|qlippoth lord]], he is older than any of the [[Demon|demons]] now residing in the [[Abyss]]. Cyth-V'sug was spawned by the [[Qlippoth lord|qlippoth lord]] called [[Oaur-Ooung]] and later ascended and transformed into a demon lord.



## Appearance

![[Cyth-V%27sug.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A common depiction of Cyth-V'sug.
> Cyth-V'sug is a misshapen and monstrous being the size of a house. His body is made of a horrid mass of tubers, fungus, and rot, shot through with grasping tentacles and claws. This horrid mass is topped by a vaguely draconic head with puffball eyes and a maw of sharp, broken teeth.


## History

> During the ancient war between the demons and [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] shortly after the formers' creation, the qlippoth lord Cyth-V'sug did not want to take part, staying in his realm and slaughtering any invading demons. He eventually observed that the demons were worshipped by self-destructive [[Mortal|mortals]], and as he sent tendrils of consciousness into the [[Material Plane]], he found desperate creatures looking for answers to their prayers and responded to them. This increased his strength, but Cyth-V'sug was still forced to remain in the deep Abyss alongside the qlippoth.
> Cyth-V'sug continued to hear the pleas for divine gifts and responses from his worshippers. This greed caused Cyth-V'sug to feel the mortal emotion of desire: for his original home, for demon blood, and for vengeance. In time, the other qlippoth lords noticed this change and threatened to destroy him, forcing him to flee to the upper Abyss.
> Cyth-V'sug realised that he had become like a hated demon, but he was still hungry and continued to demand sacrifices from his followers, slowly transforming into a demon lord. However, this did nothing to quell his hatred of demons.


## Goals

 An alternative depiction of Cyth-V'sug.
> Cyth-V'sug resides in a [[Abyssal realm|layer]] of the Abyss known as [[Jeharlu]], made up of a single writhing colony of parasitic fungus that corrupts anything it touches into a vile extension of its own consciousness. The Prince of the Blasted Heath forever yearns to expand his domain by pulling other parts of the [[Great Beyond]] into his realm. He continues to pursue the qlippoth goal of eradicating mortals and starving the demons of sin, so the qlippoth can reclaim the Abyss. He cares little that this will mean his own destruction, as it means that his hunger will finally be sated.


## Cult & worshippers

> As an ever-hungry demon lord, Cyth-V'sug has little interest in forming cults or secret societies like some of his fellow demons; instead, he hungers to absorb the whole of [[Golarion]] into his realm. Still, he does have those devoted to him on the surface world, although these are generally lone madmen obsessed with spreading his fungal taint. Followers wish to understand and reveal the powers of [[Disease|disease]] and infestation, revelling in the filth of the world. They seek to bring bloody sacrifices, especially of [[Elves|elves]], to gain a greater closeness to their master.


### The Fangwood

> In the deepest fastness of [[Nirmathas|Nirmathass]] [[Fangwood]] forest a rotten heart once beat. Originally a part of the [[Fey|fey]] [[Accressiel court]]—serving as a handmaiden to the [[Glaistig|glaistig]] [[Gendowyn]]—the jealous and spiteful [[Dryad|dryad]], [[Arlantia]], found herself corrupted by an ancient relic of the demon lord [[Treerazer]]: a [[Weapon|weapon]] called the *Spiteful Scimitar*. Immersing herself in the [[Unholy|unholy]] texts captured during the campaign against Treerazer, Arlantia eventually open a [[Portal|portal]] to Jeharlu, and merged its foul influence with her own fey [[Magic|magic]] to become the source of the virulent, supernatural contagion known as the [[Darkblight]]. Arlantia infected many of her fellow fey and lead a bloody coup against Gendowyn in [[4062 AR]], unseating and imprisoning the glaistig, and styling herself "Princess of the Blasted Heath" in her new seat of power, the Pestilent Palace. Commanding an army of blighted fey, Jeharlu demons, and even an ancient [[Black dragon|black dragon]], Arlantia courted the attentions of the ever-aloof Cyth-V'sug by spreading the Darkblight in tribute to the demon lord, hoping one day that he might notice and take her as his unholy bride. Fortunately this union never occured, and Arlantia was slain by a group of Nirmathi militia members in [[4717 AR]].


### Goroyasa

> Located off of the south western corner of the already inhospitable [[Valashmai Jungle]] in [[Tian Xia]] lies the island of [[Goroyasa]]. Every single plant or animal on the entire island is infected with a shared parasitic fungus that grants strange powers to its victims while simultaneously sapping their free will. The [[Slaves of Goroyasa]], the [[Human|human]] inhabitants of the island, are devout worshippers of Cyth-V'sug, though it is unknown how much influence the demon lord has over this infectious fungus.


### The Worldwound

> Unsurprisingly, the Prince of the Blasted Heath had a dedicated following in the [[Worldwound]], where he was venerated by numerous [[Fungus queen|fungus queens]] in [[Frostmire Fen]], who in turn were overseen by the greatest of their kind, [[Enivuni]]. The closing of the portal to the Abyss in [[4717 AR]], however, has led to a substantial loss in power there for the Lord of Filth and Pollution.


### The Darklands

> The veneration of Cyth-V'sug becomes more common below the surface of Golarion. His largest group of worshipers are likely the [[Drow|drow]] of House Urdrinor, who tend the fungus gardens of Yagasfanas and supply the drow of [[Zirnakaynin]] with edible mushrooms procured with the power of their demonic patron. The [[Dero|dero]] also occasionally turn to Cyth-V'sug in their [[Madness|madness]], searching for answers to spiritual questions. Certain mad shamans among the more violent tribes of [[Vegepygmy|vegepygmies]] have been known to ask the demon lord for assistance as well.


### Unholy text

> *The Excresence*, Cyth-V'sug's unholy text, is a living tumour that grows on the body of a devotee. To cultivate a 'copy', a cultist must smear a special foul concoction (whose recipe is only granted by Cyth-V'sug to worthy followers) on an open wound, then survive without curing the infection while the tumour grows to the size of a [[Cat|cat]], so *The Excresence* can whisper to them. If the symbiont is removed, another host must be found to keep the book alive.
> All copies of *The Excresence* share the same voice, and when near another copy, begin intoning in a creepy, harmonic unity: it is unknown if all copies are individuals or fragments of a larger intelligence. While the whispers can be copied onto paper, pages inscribed with *The Excresence* rot unnaturally quickly due to the influence of Cyth-V'sug, who ensures that only devotees have access to his wisdom.


## Relationships

> Cyth-V'sug's followers rarely interact with other religions. They sometimes work alongside the followers of [[Urgathoa]] or [[Ghlaunder]] to spread disease, but rarely for long. Cyth-V'sug despises other demon lords and wishes to sow [[Chaos|chaos]] and destruction through other means. His arch-enemy is the [[Great Old One]] [[Xhamen-Dor]], who competes with him for the same goal.


### Treerazer

> The [[Nascent demon lord|nascent demon lord]] [[Treerazer]], one of Cyth-V'sug's most potent offspring, has a mixed relationship with his progenitor. After a failed coup against the demon lord, Treerazer was exiled to Golarion around the end of the 25th century [[AR]]. There he began to establish a domain for himself in the southern part of the abandoned elven land of [[Kyonin]], but received no further punishment for his transgression. Some consider this lack of attention from Cyth-V'sug as a passive support for Treerazer and wonder if it might coincide with the demon lord's ambition to assimilate Golarion. Others are concerned that Cyth-V'sug's loss of power in the Fangwood and the Worldwound (*see above*) might presage a reconciliation between the two powers. If the demon lord were to combine his efforts with those of his offspring, it could spell the end of Kyonin and beyond.
