> **Janpati** dwells in the depths of [[Jansagar Lake]], in the heart of the [[Crying Jungle|Crying Jungles]]. The [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapadas]] of the region protect it at her behest, for [[Animal|animals]] that drink from its waters are said to gain sapience. Thousands of sapient animals do actually populate the [[Janvari]] mahajanapada and [[Tendula]], a [[Panther|panther]] [[Rajah|rajah]], rules over them. Janvari is also known as the seat of worship of [[Topimanu]], the loyal [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Monkey|monkey]] [[Deity|god]] who wields a [[Mace|mace]].
