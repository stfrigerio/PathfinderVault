> **Barzahk** is the [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp usher]] responsible for maintaining the [[Dead Roads]], the route network used by the [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]] to travel to the [[Material Plane]]. Barzahk also keeps track of visitors arriving at and leaving the [[Boneyard]]. Their symbol of office is the [[Artefact|artefact]] known as *[[Surcease of Sorrows]]*.



## History

> Barzahk was born from the needs and fears of [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]], and emerged fully formed at the same time as the Dead Roads.


## Home

> Barzahk endlessly roams the Dead Roads and rarely attends to their duties, but has difficulty understanding the world outside and seldom leaves their realm.


## Appearance

> Barzahk resembles a giant migratory [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird]] clad in robes. Barzahk carries a tombstone and key that, when used together, can lock or unlock a [[Soul|souls]] memories upon their passage to the afterlife.


## Servants

> Barzahk's servants benefit from significant autonomy, akin to that of psychopomp ushers; real ushers are quick to disabuse such hubris.
