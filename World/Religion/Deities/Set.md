> **Set** is a member of the [[Osirian pantheon]] whose portfolio involves darkness, deserts, murder, and storms. Set personifies [[Evil|evil]] and is the pantheon's most reviled member.



## Appearance

> Set appears as a lean [[Osirion|Osirian]] man with the head of a [[Sha|sha]].


## Relationships

![[Osirian_Pantheon.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A Family Tree of the Osirian Pantheon.
> Set is the brother of [[Isis]], [[Osiris]], and [[Nephthys]]. According to Osirian folklore, Set was responsible for the [[Age of Darkness]] by murdering Osiris, scattering his corpse, and trying to usurp him.
> As a result, both Osiris and his son [[Horus]] are Set's enemies. While Isis is also Set's sister, she also considers Set to be a sworn enemy. Although Nephthys is nominally his wife, she has no children with him—Osiris fathered her son [[Anubis]]—and she usually supports Osiris and Isis over him.
> Set also fights with Anubis over the [[Soul|souls]] of the dead. Anubis wants to deliver them to the [[Boneyard]], while Set wants to steal them or turn them into [[Undead|undead]]. Due to his destructive nature, he is also opposed to [[Bes]], [[Khepri]], [[Ptah]], and [[Maat]].
> Set has a son with [[Neith]] called [[Sobek]], who sometimes supports his father. Neith has occasionally worked as a mediator between Set and Horus.


## Worshippers

> Set is worshipped by [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]], [[Warrior|warriors]], [[Evil|evil]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]], kinslayers, murderers, usurpers, and [[Pharaoh|pharaohs]] who value strength and cunning. He is also a patron of [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|assassins]], [[Rogue|rogues]], and [[Necromancy|necromancers]].
