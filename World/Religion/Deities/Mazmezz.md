> **Mazmezz** (pronounced MAZ-mez) is the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of all the world's foul and scuttling [[Vermin|vermin]] and holds court in her [[Abyss|abyssal realm]] of [[Khavak-Vog]].



## History

![[Mazmezz_portrait.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A portrait of Mazmezz.
> Mazmezz began life as a [[Qlippoth lord|qlippoth lord]] and spawned the first [[Bebilith|bebiliths]]. When she found herself worshipped by [[Mortal|mortals]] (particularly [[Drow|drow]]), she began to enjoy the attention and became interested in their lives. As she found out that her fellow [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] sought to destroy them to eradicate sin and starve the [[Demon|demons]], she turned traitor and became a demon lord. She does not care that her bebilith children continue to hunt demons, as she only values mortal worship, unconcerned with the fate of her followers once they become demons.


## Appearance

> Mazmezz's appearance is monstrously alien. Being one of the ancient qlippoth that roamed the [[Abyss]] before the creation of the [[Material Plane]], there is no trace of sanity in her form. Mazmezz appears as a horrid tangle of insectoid legs, claws, pincers, and spinnerets, all coming from one horrible, writhing hairy mass at her centre. Mazmezz's only other real feature is her mouth, a pit of thrashing [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spider]]-like fangs that devour all who venture too close. Mazmezz can wrap herself in special webbing to make her appear as anything she wants.


## Cult and worshippers

> Mazmezz has no organised cult, just isolated madmen, among [[Human|humans]], behaving more as a vermin-like force of destruction than a [[Deity|deity]]. Her largest [[Humanoid|humanoid]] following is among the depraved drow of the [[Darklands]], in particular the vermin lords of [[House Moivas]]. Mazmezz finds an ardent group of worshippers among the most famous of the drow's [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarped]] monstrosities, the arachnid [[Drider|driders]]. Mazmezz is also often worshipped by the more natural but no less disturbing surface-dwelling spider creatures known as [[Ettercap|ettercaps]].
