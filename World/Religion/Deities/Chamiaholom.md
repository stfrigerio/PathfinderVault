> **Chamiaholom** is a [[Sahkil tormentor|sahkil tormentor]] who rules over the fear of death and reminds [[Mortal|mortals]] that their time will come. He is insulted by the very existence of the [[House of the Itinerant Soul]], a place in the [[Ethereal Plane]] where [[Unfettered phantom|unfettered phantoms]] might find respite, but all of his attempts to destroy it have failed, and after a few centuries of respite it is speculated that he will make a new attempt soon. He resembles a [[Skeleton|skeleton]] twice as tall as a [[Human|human]] and carries a [[Staff|staff]] made of the skulls of his victims.
