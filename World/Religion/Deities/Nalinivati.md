> **Nalinivati** is the patron [[Naga|naga]] [[Deity|goddess]] of the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake-like]] [[Humanoid|humanoids]] known as the [[Nagaji|nagaji]]. She is a goddess of fertility, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]] and [[Sorcerer|sorcery]], she is mainly worshipped across [[Tian Xia]].



## Appearance

> Nalinivati appears as a particularly huge naga of an unknown type with brilliantly coloured scales and vibrant hair. In [[Art|art]], she is often shown as either emerging from an egg, or protectively guarding either a single egg or a clutch of eggs.


## Holy symbol and animal

> Her [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] is a lotus flower wherein a snake lies coiled. Snakes are naturally considered holy [[Animal|animals]] to those of her faith.


## History

> She was once a mortal naga [[Sorceress|sorceress]] and, through her [[Magic|magical]] powers and many daughters, established [[Nagajor]], ruling as its first queen and founding its major institutions, which persist today. Her female descendants continue to rule Nagajor as Matriarchs. She [[Ascension|ascended]] to [[Deity|divinity]] through unknown means near the end of her life, and is now worshipped in many neighboring nations, as well as her home of Nagajor. Said to have created the [[Nagaji|nagaji]], Nalinivati long ago gifted the race with free will. They number among her most devout non-naga worshippers.


## Relationships

> Nalinivati is said to be the daughter of the [[Vudra|Vudran]] goddess [[Ravithra]], having originally emerged from her throat. Nalinivati has been romantically linked with the [[Kitsune|kitsune]] [[Deity|deity]] [[Daikitsu]], although both deities deny this claim.


## Church of Nalinivati

> Nalinivati is also known to her worshippers as the "Queen of Nagas" and as the "Serpent's Kiss". Her worshippers are most commonly sorcerers, nagaji, and smitten lovers (in her fertility aspect) but she also has many snake cults dedicated to her. She is most popular in the realm she founded, Nagajor, but is also commonly worshipped in [[Dtang Ma]], [[Xa Hoi]], and [[Xidao]]. Genealogy and heritage are important to Nalinivati and her worshippers. She judges based on family as well as individual merit. The *[[Lotus Annals]]* are a book written by Nalinivati's great-granddaughter [[Holadi]] that contain many stories about and parables told by the goddess before she ascended to godhood. While not considered a true holy text, the *Lotus Annals* are thought to contain considerable spiritual wisdom for worshippers of Nalinivati.


### Sacred weapon

> Nalinivati's favoured [[Weapon|weapons]] are natural jaws or bite and the manufactured [[Urumi|urumi]]. This favoured status by Nalinivati's followers led to a wider popularity for the urumi across the [[Inner Sea region]].
