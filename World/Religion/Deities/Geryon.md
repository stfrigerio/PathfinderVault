> The [[Archdevil|archdevil]] **Geryon** (pronounced JER-ee-ehn) is the master of swampy [[Stygia]], [[Hell|Hells]] fifth layer. Geryon is the source of all great heresies. It was formerly an [[Asura rana|asura rana]] before becoming an archdevil; it notably devoured 812 other tyrants of Hell before swearing itself to [[Asmodeus]] in the Only Vow.



## Appearance

> Geryon appears as a knot of three massive, scaled [[Serpent|serpents]], but beyond that even its appearance is a deception. It can regurgitate the top half of any creature it has ever devoured, and so converse or battle in an unimaginable number of forms. Excluding [[Mammon]], the Serpent is the largest archdevil at over ninety feet in length.The heads of Geryon often wear elaborate helms, but at least one always remains unarmored to show off it's reptilian features.


## History

> When the [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] [[Asmodeus]] found a simple, darkened shrine in [[Hell]] when wandering the [[Great Beyond]], the serpent that would become Geryon appeared and asked him who he was. Asmodeus learnt of the serpent and its people, the [[Asura|asuras]], as well as its neighbours in Hell, the [[Velstrac|velstracs]]. Asmodeus learned much of beings beyond [[Heaven]], and he in turn shared many of Heaven's truths and innovations to the asuras and velstracs before returning to Heaven.
> The serpent recognised Asmodeus and remembered all they had learned from one another after he fell from Heaven and led his followers in an exodus to Hell. It petitioned to enter [[Dis]], a bastion just hastily claimed by Asmodeus, and spoke in private to him. As they negotiated, a truce held between the invaders and defenders before the serpent exploded from Asmodeus' keep and nearly destroyed Dis.
> The serpent issued a call for Hell's tyrants to unite their armies against Heaven's rejects. 812 asura ranas, [[Velstrac demagogue|velstrac demagogues]] and [[Hell gigas|gigas]] warlords answered the call, and the serpent consumed them all. With their armies shattered, the asura ranas cursed the serpent and fled to a corner of Hell called [[Atalu]], while the velstracs departed Hell for the [[Shadow Plane]], granting Asmodeus and his followers a foothold over Hell. Only Asmodeus knows what promises turned the serpent against its people.
> Asmodeus' forces proceeded to conquer the entirety of Hell except for the serpent's realm of [[Stygia]], where the treasures, [[Slaves|slaves]], and cities of Hell's defiant inhabitants were transferred. After the end of the conquest, Asmodeus granted the serpent a legion of [[Devil|devils]] for it to consume and share their blood, along with all the spoils, wisdom, and secrets of the asura, and allowed it to continue ruling over Stygia. The serpent swore itself to Asmodeus in the Only Vow, a word that none remembers, and Asmodeus named it Geryon.


## Religion


### Worshippers

> Worshipers of Geryon crave forbidden knowledge above all things. Sacred places are hidden in old libraries and amid the ruins of fallen (or failing) kingdoms.


### Unholy text

> ***The Only Vow*** is a short dissertation retelling the story of how Geryon swore allegiance to Asmodeus and became an Archdevil. It also explores several hypotheses on what the word that bound the Serpent to Asmodeus's service was.


> Paizo published a major article about Geryon in *[[Scourge of the Godclaw]]*.
