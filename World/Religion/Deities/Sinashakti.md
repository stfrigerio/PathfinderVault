> The [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azata]] [[Empyreal Lord|empyreal Lord]] **Sinashakti** runs through the [[Great Beyond|planes]] in search of knowledge, sharing his many tales with those whom he meets along the way. The Walker of Worlds seeks to see all there is and learn the ways of all societies in the [[Great Beyond]].


## Church of Sinashakti

> Followers of Sinashakti typically forswear permanent residence and are usually [[Bard's End|bards]] and traveling merchants. They are motivated by the joy of travel and exploration rather than by wealth.
> A typical greeting to the faithful is, "May the light carry you far today."
> Worshippers of Sinashakti have been known to congregate in [[Magnimar]].
