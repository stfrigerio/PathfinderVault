> A relatively new faith, **Urazra** seems to have only existed a few hundred years (less than a lifespan to its [[Stone giant|stone giant]] worshipers).  It is proving popular with younger stone giants. Urazra is a savage deity promising his followers greater strength, fortitude and even complete immunity to pain in exchange for acts of brutal savagery and sacrifices of still bloody raw flesh.


## Church of Urazra

> The cult of Urazra is made up mostly of stone giants, many of whom are younger, as the elders tend to look down on Urazra's worship, claiming it appeals to the most base and savage part of giant nature. Many of Urazra's worshipers are [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]] who claim that their rage is channeled directly from the god himself. Despite the relative youth of this religion, it has spread through charismatic young stone giant preachers who claim that strength, ferocity, and savagery are more important than the virtues of work, knowledge, and history that their elders have taught them. Urazra is also occasionally worshiped by the more intelligent [[Hill giant|hill giants]].
