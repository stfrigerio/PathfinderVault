> **Ymeri**, Queen of the Inferno, dwells within the [[Auroric Palace]] on the Elemental [[Plane of Fire]], and is one of the four powerful beings collectively known as the [[Elemental lord|elemental lords]]. She is served there by a cult of fiery creatures—[[Efreeti|efreet]], [[Fire mephit|fire mephits]], [[Fire elemental|fire elementals]], and others. Her followers seek to raise her to [[Divine|divine]] status, and ultimately gain control over the entire Plane of Fire.
> She believes that [[Element|elemental earth]] will eventually succumb to [[Element|elemental fire]], and appears to be seeking to promote war between the efreet and the [[Shaitan|shaitans]] of the [[Plane of Earth]]. This is possibly connected to her rivalry with the mysterious being of elemental earth known as [[Ayrzul]], the Fossilised King.
> Ymeri has long sought the worship of the [[Salamander|salamanders]] but, instead, they mostly revere the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Flauros]].
> [[Efreeti]] [[Jhavhul|Prince Jhavhul]] has long been an admirer of Ymeri, but his advances have been rebuffed.
