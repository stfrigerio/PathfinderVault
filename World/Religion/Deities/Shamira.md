> **Shamira** is a [[Demon lordNascent demon lord|nascent demon lord]] who currently controls the [[Midnight Isles]], the former [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Nocticula]], and is the most likely candidate to become a full [[Demon lord|demon lord]] to inherit the vacancy Nocticula left behind. Prior to Nocticula's [[Ascension|ascension]], she was the most senior and most powerful of the [[Succubus|succubi]] and [[Incubus|incubi]] in the Midnight Isles, and ruler of the Midnight Isle of [[Alinythia island|Alinythia]] and the Porphyry City of [[Alushinyrra]].



## Background

> Shamira's aim and portfolio is to entice pure [[Soul|souls]] to fall to their lustful desires; she is known to frequent the [[Material Plane]] in order to fulfil this goal. Sometimes, Shamira impersonates a priestess of a [[Deity|god]] of the [[Upper Planes]] to facilitate the seduction and its corruption of the goodly soul.


## Home

> Shamira rules the city of Alushinyrra from the Harem of Burning Delights, a position which has granted her no small amount of influence. She regularly openly walks its streets to maintain a high visibility in the city. Prior to Nocticula's recent departure from the Abyss, she once relied on Shamira to govern the city on her behalf and inform her of any significant developments, before officially leaving Alushinyrra to her since her disappearance. The impact of this event is minimal, as Nocticula has never had a significant presence in Alushinyrra.


## Appearance

> Appearing in her [[Demon|demon]] form of a succubus, Shamira has wings like those of a [[Phoenix|phoenix]], crimson coloured hair and wields a [[Bow|bow]] made of pure fire.


## Relationships

> It is claimed, but sensibly never by Shamira herself, that only Shamira has ever successfully enticed Nocticula. Nevertheless, Nocticula and Shamira are lovers. While much is made of her role as Nocticula's lover, she is also the closest thing she has to a rival and, as such, Nocticula always keeps a close watch on Shamira, while Shamira in turn subtly attempts to erode Nocticula's power. More speculation exists around Shamira's parentage, with some believing her to be the daughter of [[Sarenrae]]; if this fact were true, it might explain the fascination Shamira seems to have for the Dawnflower and her faith. Further adding to the speculation of Shamira's origin, before the night she appeared in Nocticula's bedchamber (a feat that should have been impossible), there is none in the [[Abyss]] who can remember the distinctive demoness. Shamira bears no ill will toward her former mistress after Nocticula became a [[Deity|deity]] and left the Midnight Isles in her control.


## Unholy symbol

> Shamira's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is an upside-down ankh formed from a naked woman with outstretched arms and burning wings.
