> The [[Demon lord|demon lord]] **Sifkesh's** (pronounced SIF-kesh) goals differ from those of most other [[Demon|demons]], in that she seeks to destroy not just the flesh, but to wholly corrupt mortals' souls as well.  Her symbol is a pair of crossed female hands with slit wrists.



## History

> Some believe that Sifkesh was originally a powerful [[Erinyes|erinyes]] [[Devil|devil]] who was seduced by the power of the Abyss and became one of the first of [[Hell]]'s heretics.


## Home

> Sifkesh makes her home in the [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Vantian]], the infamous 'City of Open Windows',


## Appearance

> Sifkesh appears as an emaciated human woman with deathly-white skin, limp black hair that constantly drips blood, and white bird wings. Disturbingly, her eyes and lips are sewn shut with rusty wire and her body is dismembered at the neck, shoulders, ankles, wrists, hips, and wings.  Each body part floats independently, moving slightly out-of-sync with the others.


## Beliefs and goals

> Sifkesh differs from most other demon lords, in that she wishes to not just cause the bodily destruction of mortals, but wishes to corrupt their souls as well.  Her highest ambition is the fracturing of a good, devout person's faith through careful seduction, leading them to apostasy. It is said her greatest joy is lies in witnessing the moment when a corrupted priest realises how far they have sank and seeks suicide as the answer, forever damning there soul to her Abyssal realm of Vantian. Because of her corrupting ways Sifkesh presents somewhat of a conundrum to most [[Demonology|demonologists]], combining elements of all three fiendish races: she corrupts like devilkind, feeds on souls like a [[Daemon|daemon]], but is still a demon.


## Emissaries

> [[Seraptis]] demons are the favoured servants of Sifkesh, though they do act for other demon lords, primarily [[Nocticula]] and [[Socothbenoth]].


## Cults

> Small groups dedicated to Sifkesh attempt to drive unsuspecting victims to murder and suicide.  Their favorite weapon is the easily concealable blade called the [[War razor|war razor]], said to be sacred to their patron.


### The Path of Grace

> In [[4573 AR]], a cult of the demon lord, calling itself the [[Path of Grace]] appeared in the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] capital of [[Westcrown]]. Their members were chosen from the city's wealthiest citizens, many of them fervent followers of [[Aroden]]. They began to ritually murder people, and caused widespread panic, a series of crimes soon labeled the [[White Plague]]. The response to these crimes eventually led to the formation of the rightly feared [[Hellknights]]. The cult was finally defeated in the spring of [[4577 AR]] by the founder of the Hellknights, [[Daidian Ruel]].


### The Drowning Stones

> A cult of Sifkesh-worshiping [[Skum|skum]] was recently discovered by [[Pathfinder Society|Pathfinders]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] at a place called the [[Drowning Stones]].  They were led by a [[Herald|herald]] of the demon lord, a powerful [[Succubus|succubus]] named the Razor of Sifkesh. Not only where the Drowning Stones a site of worship, but it was here that Sifkesh's worshipers created Sifkesh's Bane, magical stones that made people more suggestible to suicidal impulses.


### The Way of Transcendent Bliss

> The [[Way of Transcendent Bliss]] was brought to the small [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] town [[Belila]] by a charismatic woman named [[Minesqa Rovoyosh]] in [[4711 AR]].
