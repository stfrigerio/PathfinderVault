>  **Alseta** is the [[Taldan]] [[goddess]] of doorways, [[portals]], thresholds, and the transition from year to year. She maintains favorable relations with most civilized deities, watching over their domains in times of their absence or playing hostess for gatherings of gods. She is informally the goddess of [[teleportation]], which comes with her dominion over doorways, though this additional aspect of her portfolio is unofficial. [[Elves]] also consider her the patron deity of [[elf gates]], though again, this is not part of her official portfolio.



## Appearance

>  Alseta is generally depicted in artwork in the form of a pleasant-faced woman adorned in plain gray attire. The most distinctive element of her appearance is the smiling mask she commonly wears on the back of her head.


## Church of Alseta

>  Alseta's worshipers can most commonly be found in [[Absalom]], [[Brevoy]], [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], and [[Taldor]].


### Temples &amp; shrines

>  Widespread formal worship of Alseta is uncommon even among the elves, although small shrines to her can be found near almost all elf gates, and her [[holy symbol]] is frequently found carved into the lintels of elven doorways.
