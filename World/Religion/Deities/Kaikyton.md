> **Kaikyton** is a [[Velstrac demagogue|velstrac demagogue]] who seeks to merge parts into greater wholes.


## History

> Kaikyton was born a [[Human|human]] on [[Golarion]] in the [[Age of Darkness]]. A ruthless leader, she was determined to see her people survive through the suffering of [[Earthfall]]. She eventually came to the [[Shadow Plane]], learnt the art of stitching flesh from the velstracs, and taught it to her subjects.
> After becoming a velstrac, she created the canyon city of Kagalko in the [[Age of Darkness]]; it is unknown if this region was her original home or somewhere else that drew her attention. Ever since, the Choir Vales of southern [[Garund]] have been marred by the miles-long march of razor-sharp ridges known as Velstrac Lace. When Kaikyton used her flesh-stitching skill on herself, she [[Ascension|ascended]] and became a demagogue.
> Kaikyton's name is the source of the exonym *[[Kyton|kyton]]*, which began to be used when some ancient [[Mortal|mortals]] associated the onomatopoeia 'Kaikyton', reminiscent of the clanking of chains, with her followers during the millennia she spent wandering the [[Material Plane]] seeking to reshape whole [[Planet|worlds]]. Velstracs decided that they liked the word *kyton* and do not try to correct mortals when referred to by this name.


## Home

> Kaikyton deposits her most successful chimaeric creations in the village of Iei in the [[Shadow Plane]], where they live observed and provided for by her followers.
