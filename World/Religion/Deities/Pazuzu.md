> The [[Demon lord|demon lord]] Pazuzu (pronounced pah-ZOO-zoo) has claimed for himself the title of King of the Wind Demons and few dare dispute it. 



## History

> Pazuzu's breath is likened to a plague of locusts and many believe his first breath on the [[Material Plane]] brought about the entity that would become the demon lord [[Deskari]]. Pazuzu is as old as is his power—he ascended to demon lordship at the same time as [[Lamashtu]], [[Abraxas]] and [[Dagon]].
> In ages long past, Pazuzu and his lover Lamashtu slaughtered hordes of greater [[Demon|demons]] together to claim a large portion of the [[Abyss]], which they ruled jointly. Lamashtu's ascension to [[Deity|godhood]] enraged Pazuzu, who betrayed her by stabbing her with a [[Cold iron|cold iron]] shard from the heart of a mountain before casting her into an infinitely deep chasm from where she languished for centuries. Ultimately, Lamashtu emerged and wrested control of the plane from Pazuzu. The two have been bitter rivals ever since.


## Home

> Pazuzu has a 'rookery' called Shibaxet located in his vertical [[Abyssal realm]], [[High M'Vania|High MVania]].


## Appearance

> Pazuzu has the body of a thin and wiry man with several monstrous additions. These include having the legs and flesh-rending talons of a predatory [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird]], two sets of majestic [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Eagle|eagles]] wings that sprout from his back, a ferociously [[Evil|evil]]-looking avian head, and a [[Poison|poisonous]] [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake]] in place of his genitals and a [[Scorpion|scorpions]] stinger as a tail. He wields the *Scepter of Shibaxet*, a black, hooked, metal [[Staff|staff]].


## Relationships


### Deskari

> The Abyssal mating of Pazuzu with a giant [[Demon|demon]] resembling an insect resulted in the 'hatching' of Deskari; Pazuzu is thus considered the 'father' of Deskari. Under the protection of his father, Deskari rose in power within the Abyss eventually attaining full demon lord status himself. Deskari admired Pazuzu and they maintained cordial relations with each other. Although Deskari and Pazuzu were similar in levels of power, Deskari maintained a modicum of subservience to his father and Deskari's success brought credit to Pazuzu. Deskari's mother's name is unknown and she clearly was destroyed at some point as Deskari has created his brutal scythe, *[[Riftcarver]]*, from her remains. Deskari was killed in [[4718 AR]] by a band of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] at the conclusion of the [[Fifth Mendevian Crusade]].


### Lamashtu and Baphomet

> Pazuzu is in constant conflict with the more popular, fully-fledged demon goddess [[Lamashtu]]. This feud has been going on for eons, since before Lamashtu's ascension to godhood when she was just another demon lord. Pazuzu also covets Lamashtu's position as goddess of beasts, and desperately wishes to usurp her dominion over them. This conflict, and the resources it takes to fight, may have cost Pazuzu greater power, even ascension to god status. In his war against the Mother of Monsters, he recruits allies from [[Hell]] and [[Abaddon]]. Pazuzu's name is believed to disperse Lamashtu's influence, and amulets with his name or image are worn by pregnant women and newborns to ward her corruption away.
> Before they became bitter enemies, Pazuzu and Lamashtu were lovers during the [[Age of Creation]]. One of their trysts in what would become the [[Lost Coast]] region of [[Varisia]] gave birth to a son named [[Uvaglor]], among other spawn. Their cults rebuff this story out of a terrible shame, and have been playing out their patrons' battle in a small way.
> [[Baphomet|Baphomets]] closeness to Lamashtu means that, although he has no personal enmity with Pazuzu himself, Baphomet opposes Pazuzu to maintain his good relationship with the Mother of Monsters.


### Ylimancha

> Pazuzu also wars endlessly against the [[Agathion|agathion]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] [[Ylimancha]] for dominion over flying beasts.


## Influence

> Unlike most other demon lords, who work their evil on the world through cultists and [[Demon|demonic]] minions, Pazuzu is fond of taking direct action on the [[Material Plane]]. His favoured method of influencing the [[Mortal|mortal]] world is through possession. It is said that just saying Pazuzu's name is enough to invite the demon lord's unfriendly attention. Through possession, Pazuzu has shaped many terrible events in the world, from huge calamities, like the formation of the [[Worldwound]], to more minor atrocities, such as the recent [[Chopper]] murders in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of [[Sandpoint]].


## Cult and worshipers

> Pazuzu has declared himself the King of Wind Demons and patron of all that is evil and flies. While this is a grandiose claim, it is far from unfounded arrogance. Pazuzu is worshiped by a wide variety of evil flying creatures. His most fervent followers are the [[Vrock|vrock demons]], [[Harpy|harpies]], and the [[Kuchrima|kuchrima]] [[Lamyros|lamia]], though these also pay worship to the demon lord [[Nocticula]]. While he has no specific doctrine or edict for his followers, Pazuzu's cults are nonetheless present across the world, if only in the shadows.
