> **Chadali** is a powerful [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azata]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]]. Legend holds that Chadali was created from the simultaneous occurrence of a yellow aurora, [[Moon|lunar]] eclipse, and [[Meteor|meteor]] shower on [[Elysium]]. She lives along the Boundless Azure Ocean in Elysium in the Pavilion of Serendipity. She believes that fate is beautiful and the biggest sin is to be so over structured as to prevent chance happenings.


## Appearance

> The Serendipitous Path wears pale yellow [[Silk|silk]] robes, carries a red-threaded [[Net|net]] with [[Ruby|rubies]] in the folds, and wears water lilies in her shiny black hair. She looks like a middle-aged [[Vudrani]] woman.


## Church of Chadali

> Chadali's [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] is a perfectly symmetrical water lily. Her temples are found at crossroads, fortune-telling dens, sanctuaries, and underground tunnel. Those devoted to her spend an hour each day losing themselves in strange places, unless in a known area, where they instead blindfold themselves and boldly explore for 200 or more steps. Her minions include half-celestial [[Minotaur|minotaurs]] and [[Unicorn|unicorns]].
