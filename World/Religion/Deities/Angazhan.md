> **Angazhan** (pronounced ANG-uh-zan) rules over the [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Ahvoth-Kor]] and is the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of savage strength and destruction.



## Appearance

![[Angazhan.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A common depiction of Angazhan.
> Angazhan appears as an enormous, muscular, and savage red-furred [[Ape|ape]] with six long fingers on each hand, capable of complex manipulation or tearing a [[Human|human]] limb from limb. Angazhan's ape-like demonic visage is completed by his fanged maw, twisted horns, and tiny bloodshot eyes; this gives him a unique appearance amongst his simian followers.
> In combat, Angazhan favors to bite, crush, impale, or sting his opponents with his fangs, fists, horns, or long, reptilian tail, respectively. Those slain by him personally are sometimes [[Curse|cursed]] to return to life again and again as a [[Gorilla King]] bound to his service.


## Home

> Angazhan's domain of [[Ahvoth-Kor]] is a seemingly-endless jungle that runs along both sides of a long Abyssal rift. The two jungles meet ten thousand miles down, at the base of the rift, where Angazhan's black stone ziggurat palace sits atop yet more rifts leading deeper into the trackless [[Abyss]].


## Servants

> In Ahvoth-Kor, Angazhan is served by thousands of powerful [[Nalfeshnee|nalfeshnees]], though few of the fiercely independent [[Demon|demons]] would care to admit that Angazhan is their lord and master.
> Angazhan is served by his created [[Baregara|baregara]] minions in Ahvoth-Kor as well as in [[Material Plane]] jungles important to him, such as the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


## Cult and worshipers

> Cults dedicated to the Ravener King on [[Golarion]] are concentrated in the Mwangi Expanse, where he is venerated by both the human [[Mwangi human ethnicityBekyar|Bekyar]] tribe and the simian [[Charau-ka|charau-ka]]—or ape-men—who feast on humans like livestock.
> The Expanse is also home to Angazhan's most favored [[Mortal|mortal]] servant, [[Ruthazek]] the [[Gorilla King]], who leads the [[Spawn of Angazhan]] from his seat of power in the city of [[Usaro]]. It is not clear why the Mwangi Expanse has drawn the demon lord's attention to the region for so long, but Ruthazek is merely the latest of a long line of Gorilla Kings ruling Usaro, dating back to before humans began to dominate the continent of [[Garund]]. Each successive Gorilla King has been a brutal mortal reincarnated into the form of an awakened dire gorilla by one of [[Totem of Angazhan|Angazhans totems]] after the death of their predecessor.


### Obedience

> Certain devotees of the Ravener King gain special powers by ingesting jungle [[Drug|hallucinogens]], chanting, and beating a complex rhythm on drums made of human skin and bones.
