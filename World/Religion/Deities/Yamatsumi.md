> **Yamatsumi** is the [[Tian-Min]] [[Deity|god]] of winter, mountains, and [[Volcano|volcanoes]]. His [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] is an erupting, snow-capped [[Volcano|volcano]].



## Appearance

> The Mountain Lord is most frequently depicted as a [[Giant|giant]] with [[Sheep|rams horns]] on his head, ice for skin, and a beard and hair made of living lava.


## Dogma

> Yamatsumi is a nature deity of mountains, with a particular interest in volcanoes. He is also a god of renewal, as the spring melt from the mountains brings needed moisture to the lowlands, and ash from volcanic eruptions enriches the soil.


## Church of Yamatsumi


### Worshipers

> Yamatsumi's most common devotees are ascetic monks, or [[Yamabushi|yamabushi]], who make their home in the mountains. From their high mountain perches, they tend to take a detached view of the common problems of civilization, preferring solitude and the grandeur of the natural world. Many common people also invoke Yamatsumi's protection when they witness a belching volcano or feel the first cold of winter.
> Yamatsumi is most frequently worshiped in the nations of [[Dtang Ma]], [[Hongal]], [[Minkai]], [[Nagajor]], and [[Zi Ha]], as well as among the tribes of the [[Wall of Heaven]] mountains. He is also among the most frequently worshiped Tian deities in the [[Inner Sea region]].


### Temples and shrines

> Every mountaintop, especially when covered in snow, is a temple to Yamatsumi. Volcanic eruptions are a sign of his displeasure.
