> **Yig** is the [[Great Old One]] of cycles, procreation, and [[Serpent|serpents]]. He is undoubtedly the least [[Evil|evil]] among all Great Old Ones and [[Outer God|Outer Gods]], but he is still a terrifying [[Deity|deity]] willing to devour his own worshippers if he is hungry.



## Appearance

> Yig's true form is that of a scaled [[Monstrous humanoid|monstrous humanoid]] with a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]] tail and head, and he can also appear as a snake with a crescent mark upon the brow. In his true form, Yig stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,100 pounds.


## Providence

> Yig's favour manifests in bountiful harvests and hunts, and healthy babies who sometimes bear crescent birthmarks on their brows that mark Yig's blessing. His displeasure results in the birth of monstrous babies who kill their mothers and drive their fathers [[Insanity|insane]], and always bear Yig's crescent [[Moon|moon]] as a birthmark. Creatures that harmed snakes or Yig's [[Cleric|clerics]] sometimes suffer from serpentine nightmares that sap their intelligence and eventually turn them into snakes, but he rarely holds grudges against those who defeated him.


## Cults

> Yig is worshipped by nomadic and rural communities who live close to the land, and his cult has no presence in cities. Unlike most Great Old Ones, Yig cares about his worshippers, and protects them if they practice the proper rites of worship, but failure to do so leads to swift punishment. Yig has few constructed temples, and his worship often takes place in a forest clearing, a circle of standing stones, or a cave mouth.
> Despite being a snake god, Yig is not worshipped by the [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]], and is an enemy of their patron [[Ydersius]]. After Ydersius was decapitated by [[Savith]], Yig turned his attention elsewhere.
