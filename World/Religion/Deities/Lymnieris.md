> **Lymnieris** is an [[Angel|angel]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] of [[Prostitution|prostitution]], rites of passage, and virginity. He teaches that a person's passage from one state of being to another is a sacred time.



## Home

> Lymnieris makes his home in the blue agate [[Palace of Delectation]]. Located in [[Heaven]], visitors to the palace are joyfully greeted by beautiful and sensitive courtesans. Lymnieris often hosts the empyreal lord [[Arshea]] at his home, and when he is present, the festivities here take on an unrivaled intensity. He maintains a second home on the opposite side of Heaven's mountain where his followers counsel and heal those who have been rescued from forced [[Prostitution|prostitution]].


## Appearance

> Lymnieris is tall and radiant, with delicate hands, emerald-green skin and four white wings, covered in a perpetual thin sheen of perspiration. Because of his appearance, he is speculated to have originated as a [[Planetar|planetar]]. He carries a great white [[Shield|shield]] made of ivory.


## Cults

> Virgins forced into unwanted marriages, those who cannot fulfil their sexual desires due to cultural restrictions, prostitutes who work legally and love their profession, individuals forced into sexual [[Slavery|slavery]], and those on the threshold of a major personal change all pray to Lymnieris.
