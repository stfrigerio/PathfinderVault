> **Nocticula** (pronounced nok-TICK-you-lah), the Redeemer Queen, is a [[Deity|goddess]] of [[Art|artists]], midnight and exiles, and a former [[Demon lord|demon lord]] who concerned herself then with the [[Metaphysical|metaphysical]] qualities of darkness and lust. She excelled in seduction, beauty, cruelty, and sadism.

## History

> Nocticula originated as the first [[Succubus|succubus]] in the [[Abyss]], eventually ascending to become the demon lord of [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|assassins]] and ruler of her former kind. When [[Nahyndri]], demon lord of [[Gem|gems]], prisons and [[Slavery|slavery]], tried to enslave her, Nocticula killed him in self-defence and discovered that she had the power to kill other demon lords. During her time as a demon lord, Nocticula seduced and killed numerous rivals, effectively serving as a check against their proliferation. With each death, her power grew, as did her conviction to turn against her [[Demon|demonic]] nature; she eventually made it her goal to become a full goddess and abandon [[Evil|evil]] alltogether. Some time after aiding a group of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] that later defeated [[Deskari]] and closed the [[Worldwound]], Nocticula vanished from the Abyss and achieved her goal, leaving her demonic nature behind and becoming a full goddess.


## Symbols

> Nocticula's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] consisted of a crown with many points wrapped with prickly vines. She was also symbolised with a demonic rune. Since ascension, her [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] is a [[Moon|moon]] with a pair of smirking lips and a seven-pointed crown.


## Homes

> Nocticula once dwelt in the House of Silken Shadows within the [[Abyssal realm]] known as the [[Midnight Isles]], an island realm shrouded in sensual immorality and eternal darkness. One of her first acts as a full deity was to form a new realm, the [[Midnight's Palette|Midnights Palette]], in the Boundless Azure Ocean of [[Elysium]] near the border with the [[Maelstrom]].


## Appearance

> When she was still a demon lord, Nocticula appeared as a succubus, wearing her dark hair in a complex style. Her eyes were devoid of pupils, her fingers were tipped with talons, and her feet ended in stony hooves that exuded red-hot, liquid [[Iron|iron]]. Her [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|batlike]] wings were covered with glowing runes, and three stinger-tipped tails completed her demonic visage. Like her brother, [[Socothbenoth]], she often shifted her form to meet the deepest, darkest desires of those observing her.
> As the Redeemer Queen, Nocticula has blue or purple hair and a gentler expression. Her new outfit is more complex and less revealing, although she retains her batlike wings and triple tails ending in blades.


## Relationships

> Nocticula is a master at seduction, so much so that even the other mighty demon lords were not immune to her persuasive charms. Her greatest triumph was the seduction and murder of [[Vyriavaxus]], the former demon lord of shadows. His essence was used to form the largest of Nocticula's Midnight Isles. As a result, most demon lords treated her with extreme caution. Despite their stern forbearance, her unearthly beauty also inspired lust and obsession, which tempered their fears.
> The only exception to Nocticula's distrustful relationships with other demon lords was that with her brother [[Socothbenoth]], with whom she once maintained a relatively friendly, and more disturbingly, frequently incestuous relationship. Socothbenoth eventually grew jealous of his sister's power and attempted to assassinate her, only to be humiliated as she left him broken on the steps before his realm, the [[Cathedral Thelemic]]. Socothbenoth was infuriated by how Nocticula disdained his actions and refused to acknowledge him, and feared that he might become her next victim, but this occurrence had not happened before her ascension.
> Some believe that Nocticula served [[Lamashtu]] as her personal assassin in clearing the Abyss of undesirables, but this theory holds no merit when one takes into account that she never threatened Lamashtu's archenemy [[Pazuzu]]. Indeed, Lamashtu's cult had recently become far more hostile towards Nocticula's interests, as Lamashtu rightly predicted that Nocticula would follow her as the second demon lord to ascend to godhood. [[Baphomet]] is enraged by Nocticula.
> Nocticula once regarded the [[Nascent demon lord|nascent demon lord]] [[Shamira]] as both a valued lover, companion, and minion, as well as the closest thing she had to a rival. Nocticula tasked Shamira with governing the city of [[Alushinyrra]] on her behalf, answering only to Nocticula and informing her if she needed to intervene in important events. Since her ascension, she left her old realm under the oversight of Shamira. Shamira holds no ill will toward her former mistress, but other demon lords and their cults are eager for vengeance, lest they stray from evil like she did.

### Worshipers


#### As a demon lord

> A cruel sadist on one hand and a seductive beauty on the other, as a demon lord, Nocticula was patron to traitors, assassins, and succubi (both literally and figuratively). Assassins' guilds in her service were established in many cities and were constantly at odds with other guilds, especially the feared [[Red Mantis]], often leading to protracted shadow wars. She was particularly popular amongst the [[Drow|drow]] of [[Golarion]], and was taken on as the patron of [[House Misraria]]. She was also worshiped in places of decadence such as [[Katapesh]], [[Nex]], [[Geb's Rest]], and certain [[River Kingdoms]]. Nocticula was also venerated among the [[Lamyros]], a group of [[Pharasma]]-[[Curse|cursed]] creatures that loathe all the gods, and take pleasure in confounding and destroying their [[Mortal|mortal]] servants.
> After Nocticula slew Vyriavaxus, the patron of [[Shadow demon|shadow demons]], these demons grudgingly transferred their allegience and worship to her.


#### As the Redeemer Queen

***Main article: [[Cult of the Redeemer Queen]]***
> Nocticula's followers included a once-heretical sect named the [[Cult of the Redeemer Queen]], whose members rightly believed that their patron was seeking to leave behind her demonic nature and become a goddess of [[Art|artists]], outcasts, and midnight.
> This was believed by others to be a ruse on Nocticula's part; although these skeptics agreed that Nocticula sought true godhood, they believed that the demon lord sought to become an assassin of gods and seeded rumors of her quest for redemption to hide her true intentions. Likewise, the cult has faced opposition and assassinations from more orthodox worshippers of Nocticula. Nocticula herself seemed to enjoy the strife caused by these disagreements, and granted her once-heretical followers the same [[Magic|magic]] that she granted to her traditional evil worshippers. In the end, the Cult of the Redeemer Queen was ultimately proven right.


### As the Redeemer Queen

> Since Nocticula ascended and left her evil ways behind, her followers found themselves faced with a predicament, as she stopped granting [[Divine magic|divine magic]] to [[Chaotic evil|chaotic evil]] worshippers. Some followed her into redemption and sought to cast off evil as well, but many more cannot abandon their murderous or hedonistic ways and turned their worship to other demon lords, most often Socothbenoth, [[Shax]], and [[Zura]]. In the meantime, the Redeemer Queen's cult has spread quickly, particularly in [[New Thassilon]], and especially among artists, eccentrics, and those who exult in the darkest nights. Nocticula's following has also become established in western [[Varisia]] and has developed purchase in [[Nidal]], where it has gained popularity among rebels seeking an opposing expression of darkness and the night than the pain and loss embodied by [[Zon-Kuthon]].
