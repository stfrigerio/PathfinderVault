> **Kitumu** is the carnivorous Firefly Goddess, a [[Godling|godling]] known to the [[Kembe]]. She is usually dormant but may be awakened, at which time she demands copious [[Human|human]] sacrifice: she is not a forgiving goddess.



## History

> In [[4710 AR]], Kitumu demanded the boy Mwonduk as sacrifice to stop the plague of fireflies she sent forth on the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. People considered the boy [[Curse|cursed]].


## Home

> Kitumu sleeps in the [[Pyramid of Kitumu]] deep in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


## Appearance

> Kitumu appears as a blood-red firefly with four wings, two on each side, protected by a [[Beetle|beetle]]-type carapace when not flying. Her wing span measures hundreds of feet and the wings are inscribed with unknown [[Rune|runes]]. A crimson light surrounds her.


## Emissaries

> Kitumu may send out a swarm of fireflies that can reduce a tribe to bones in an horrifyingly short time. They can bury beneath [[Armour|armour]] and get to the fleshy bits with ease. These fireflies are used to show Kitumu's displeasure.
