> **Dammerich,** sometimes spelled **Damerrich**, is a powerful [[Archon|archon]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] who concerns himself with all just executions that have been carried out. He believes that [[Evil|evil]] must be punished, though never unfairly or without due consideration.



## Appearance

> Dammerich resembles a hulking, handsome, bald man clad in black stone armour that only leaves his weary eyes visible.


## Home

> Dammerich lives in the southern wing of the [[Courts of Accord]] on [[Iudica]], the sixth tier of [[Heaven]], where he works closely alongside [[Olheon]].


## Servants

> A squad of [[Shield archon|shield archons]] serve as Dammerich's agents, hunting for corrupt judges, executioners that enjoy their work too much or view it too lightly, and criminals that deserve death but were set free.


## Church of Dammerich


### Worshippers

> Executioners pray to Dammerich when they feel the burden of guilt; he teaches that their duty is joyless but necessary to protect peace and [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|goodness]], and reassures good people when executions are necessary. Judges and morticians pray to him for guidance, and wrongfully sentenced people hoping to be acquitted can ask for help from his servants. He is also one of the most frequent empyreal lords that [[Paladin|paladins]] dedicate themselves to.
