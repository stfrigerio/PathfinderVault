> The [[Demon lordNascent demon lord|nascent demon lord]] **Murnath** resides in the sewers below the city of Yanaron on [[Lamashtu|Lamashtus]] [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Kurnugia]]. He takes the form of a [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]]-sized [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Rat|rat]] of great strength with [[Poison|poisoned]] spines near his tail, and paws which resemble [[Human|human]] hands. He is served by rats, [[Wererat|wererats]], and other denizens of his disgusting home, and is said to know its every tunnel and warren. 
> Murnath's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a horned rat seen in profile whose long tail encircles it.


## Cult and worshipers

> Murnath boasts several small but surprisingly devout [[Orc|orc]] cults that have taken root in the sewers of large cities. In dedication to the Horned Rat, these orcs will deliberately try to get infected with [[Lycanthrope|lycanthropy]] to become vicious wererats.
