> **Easivra** is a [[Sun|sun]] [[Deity|god]] who has been largely forgotten in [[Golarion]]. He was worshiped millennia ago in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] in a city known as [[Jaytirian]], together with his rival, the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Vyriavaxus]]. He represented the glory and power of the sun, the freedom of flight, and majesty of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds of prey]].
> His most powerful remnant on Golarion is an [[Artifact|artifact]] known as the *Morrowfall* although numerous other relics feature depictions of a bright bird of prey facing off against a dark [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bat]].
> He is currently worshiped only by the [[Sabosan|sabosan]], a race of nocturnal bat-like [[Humanoid|humanoids]] native to the Mwangi Expanse.
