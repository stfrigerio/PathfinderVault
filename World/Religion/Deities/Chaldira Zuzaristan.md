> **Chaldira Zuzaristan** is a [[Demigod|demigoddess]] of luck and mischief, and a close friend to [[Desna]]. She is especially revered in [[Halfling|halfling]] society.



## Appearance

> Chaldira is commonly depicted with curly hair, a freckled face, and a tattered red and green coat held together by buttons. Her other features in these depictions vary with her worshipers'.


## Relationships

> Chaldira is known to charge into battles without much planning, and as a result often needs Desna's assistance. Halflings see this as a sign of their innate racial luck and ability to survive in even the most dire of circumstances, and her refusal to compromise against [[Evil|evil]] when she has luck and allies at her back. She considers herself a friend of anyone not of an evil nature. Her easygoing friendship suits Desna more than solemn deities such as [[Irori]] and [[Pharasma]], and her focus on building communities endears her to [[Abadar]] and [[Erastil]].
> She is directly opposed to [[Thamir Gixx]] despite their shared tendencies toward mischief, impulsiveness, violence, and defending against bullies and abusers. Chaldira and her followers seek to counter the misanthropic bitterness sowed by Thamir and his faithful.


## Realm

> The [[Hearth-Grown House]] in the [[Aktun]] district of [[Axis]] is not quite a divine domain, but the chaotic collection of lodging and feasting halls serves as Chaldira's home and her base from which she monitors her foe Thamir Gixx and his underground domain. Chaldira also has several rooms of her own in Desna's realm of Cynosure, where she often visits to cheer up her friend or inspire her into adventures.


## Providence

> Those in Chaldira's favor experience exceptionally good luck and an extraordinary ability to avoid harm in reckless endeavors. Those traits turn against followers who displease her, with the notable exception of innocents and children.


## Allies

> As befits a deity of friendship, Chaldira counts many creatures across the [[Plane|planes]] as allies—friends and allies she can call on and serve in kind, rather than servants at her beck and call. These include:

[[Angravva]]
A charming, brash, [[Swashbuckler|swashbuckling]] [[Vulpinal|vulpinal]] armed with the famous *Bravo's Barb*. Angravva often follows Chaldira's dispatches to solve conflicts through diplomacy.
The Button Fellow
Chaldira's [[Herald|herald]] is a 10-foot-tall rag doll covered in buttons known as both a brawler against evil and comforting confidant to those in need. He sometimes gives one of his buttons as a lucky token of his patron's favor.
[[Frog-Slayer]]
A colorful [[Celestial|celestial]] [[Giant dragonfly|giant dragonfly]] and champion of [[Good|good]], Frog-Slayer was accidentally granted partial sentience. It sometimes offers its services as a mount to halfling [[Knight|knights]].

## Church of Chaldira Zuzaristan

> Chaldiran clergy are self-sufficient, enterprising, witty, and generous, though rarely wealthy. They serve as merry role models of harmless mischief. Her priests are social to such a degree that they are sometimes considered invasive rumormongers by those outside her faith, but to her lay followers Chaldiran priests serve as optimistic community builders who remind them during major life events about the fortuitous benefits of celebration and friendship.


### Paladins

> Her [[Paladin|paladins]] do not hesitate to throw themselves into battle against overwhelming odds, and are eager to be the downfall of evil foes who think they have luck on their side.
> Their code acknowledges the joy of mischief and does not consider theft as inherently wrong, but prohibits them from drawing joy at the expense of others or perpetuating suffering. They act immediately to protect innocents—especially children—and help friends, and are paragons of charity and curiosity. They also charge themselves with acknowledging Chaldira when luck carries them or those around them to success.


### Holy texts

*The Peltry Fables*
Tales of the adventures of [[Nolly Peltry]], who survives and succeeds with help from diverse and fantastical allies, are popular with children while still valued by adults.
*Right-Side Up*
Priests often loan out this practical [[Philosophy|philosophical]] guide on overcoming hardship through positivity and productivity.

### Holidays

[[Jestercap]]
While this day of pranks on 27 [[Lamashan]] is not limited to Chaldirans, followers of the Calamitous Turn often spend months preparing elaborate feats of mischief as holy acts of devotion.
[[Swallowtail Festival]]
Chaldirans trade lucky objects, such as buttons and [[Coin|coins]], during this autumnal Desnan festival.
