> **Zarongel** is a [[Barghest|barghest]] demigod that is numbered among the four [[Goblin hero-gods|goblin hero-gods]] that are believed to have created the goblin race. Some goblin tribes hold him in greater reverence than the other hero-gods or even [[Lamashtu]].



## Appearance

> He appears to be the most wolf-like of the four, and has hair composed of magical fire, a gift of of the goddess Lamashtu for being the first of the four to pledge himself to her; the others still envy him for this. [[Hadregash]] in particular still wishes to steal the magical gift.


## History

> [[Lamashtu]] is said to have freed Zarongel and the other three barghests from captivity by [[Asmodeus]].  He is believed to have taught goblins how to kill dogs and use [[Goblin dog|goblin dogs]] as pets and mounts, which has garnered him the title "Bar Breaker".


## Home

> All goblin hero-gods reside in [[Basalfeyst]] in the [[Abyss]].
