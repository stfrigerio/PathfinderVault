> **Phlegyas** is a [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp usher]], patron of [[Atheism|atheists]], parents (especially those who died in childbirth), and creations outlasting creators. She embodies resonance, and the works inspired by her are both beautiful, yet horrifying or painful. She offers respite to atheists who arrive in the [[Boneyard]], and trains those with potential into [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]].



## History

> In life, Phlegyas was a man and an arrogant genius and follower of [[Shelyn]], who was excommunicated due to his blasphemy and pride. However, his legacy endured among admirers and detractors alike. [[Pharasma]], seeing this as a fundamental part of [[Mortality|mortal]] experience, transformed Phlegyas into a female psychopomp usher.


## Home

> Phlegyas' realm is the Anonymous Loggia, a museum of works that endure long after their creators have been forgotten.


## Appearance

> The least monstrous psychopomp usher, Phlegyas is a tall, broad-shouldered [[Human|human]] woman wearing a simple mask and carrying an oar.
