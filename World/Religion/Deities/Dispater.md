 Dispater with [[Nocticula]] and [[Charon]].

> The [[Archdevil|archdevil]] **Dispater** (pronounced DIHS-pay-tuhr) is [[Hell]]'s greatest jailer and politician and rules its second layer, [[Dis]]. Also known as the **Iron Lord**, **Father of Dis** and **First King**, Dispater is one of the more active rulers of [[Hell]] and one of [[Asmodeus]]'s closest and longest-standing allies. His unholy symbol is an iron spike driven into a golden ring with a red and purple crown. His symbol of office is an [[Artefact|artefact]] known as *[[The Eclipsing Eye]]*.



## Appearance

> Dispater appears as a majestic, seven-foot-tall figure with rust-red skin, four horns, and a burning crown that hovers above his head. His skin bears dozens of scars and piercings, each of them a past wound turned into a mark of pride. He retains his angelic wings, though they are now black, and he keeps them retracted within his body at almost all times. The First King's staff of office is *[[The Eclipsing Eye]]*, a bladed [[Staff|staff]] with a great [[Ruby|ruby]] through which Asmodeus constantly watches him.


## History

> Dispater is a fallen [[Angel|angel]], originally the lieutenant of [[Baalzebul]], who in turn was the champion of Asmodeus. Following his war against [[Ihys]], when Asmodeus led his host to Hell in the Exodus, Dispater fell with his commander and was rewarded for his loyalty with the status of Lord of the Second.
> Alone among the lords of Hell, Dispater believes in the virtues of courtly love, and has taken three wives over the course of his eons-long existence. The first is forgotten, even by the Iron Lord himself, the only token of her existence a shattered statue in Dispater's throne room. The second was [[Feronia]], an elemental [[Demigod|demigoddess]] with whom Dispater shared a brief, tempestuous relationship that led to the birth of his son, the [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] [[Ragathiel]]. Dispater's third and current wife is [[Erecura]], a [[Mortal|once-mortal]] demigoddess who was condemned to Hell for stealing the secret of eternal life from [[Pharasma]].


## Relationships

> Dispater has allied with the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Mephistopheles]] as they both enjoy the art of ruling, and is married to Erecura.


## Travel

> Dispater rarely leaves the city of Dis. When he does, he orders the uprooting of whole gardens, menageries, markets, and theaters to go with him on his journey so that the denizens of Hell may see examples of Dis's greatest wonders. The most powerful of his armies travel with him and serve as his bodyguard, for Dispater knows that even an archdevil is not safe in Hell, surrounded by rivals and potential usurpers who are always looking for a moment of weakness. The Iron Lord never travels to the [[Material Plane]], not even in aspect, finding the mortal realm beneath him. Instead, he sends an [[Erinys|erinys]] servant or a member of his court to deal with matters there.


> [[Paizo]] published articles on Dispater in *[[Princes of Darkness Book of the Damned Volume 1|Princes of Darkness]]* and the hardcover *[[Book of the Damned sourcebook|Book of the Damned]]*. [[Kobold Quarterly 23]] also contains an article on Dispater.
