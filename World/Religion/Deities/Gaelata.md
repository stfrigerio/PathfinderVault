> **Gaelata** is a [[Bull|bull]] [[Deity|god]] whose avatar dwells in the region of [[Vudra]] known as the [[Divine Garden]].
> The Divine Garden's soil is considered sacred ground, where deities and hero-gods descend to walk among [[Mortal|mortals]].  Within the Divine Garden, edicts prevent the slaughter of [[Animal|animals]] for food to respect Gaelata, and Gaelata's avatar wanders the Garden in the form of a massive white bull.
> The [[Baghava]] [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapada]], in the south-west of the Divine Garden, has many elaborate ashrams—occult academies—throughout the region's mangrove forest, as well as temples and gardens, that are all guarded by [[Minotaur|minotaur]]-priests of Gaelata.
