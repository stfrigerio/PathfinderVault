> The serpent cult of the deceiver [[Deity|deity]] **Apep** is a twin to the cult of the benevolent [[Wadjet]] and is part of the [[Osirian pantheon|ancient cultic system]] of beliefs that existed in [[Osirion]] before they were suppressed by later [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]] rulers. The sinister, world-circling Apep symbolizes the dangers that lurk beneath the water: whirlpools, [[Crocodile|crocodiles]], and other lethal hazards. He is the [[Ship|boat]]-crashing rapids, the drowning dark, and the apocalyptic, primordial devourer of the [[Sun|sun]], light, and life. 
> It is believed Apep will eventually devour the sun, creating a night that will never end and effectively bringing about the apocalypse. The *[[Rod of the river serpent|rod of the river serpent]]* is a [[Magic item|magic item]] carved in the shape of Apep that grants its bearer the ability to see in the dark and cast hypnotic shadows, and it swallows those it strikes in combat.



## Home

> The Devourer of the Dawn is said to dwell in the Tenth Region of Night.


## Appearance

> Apep is a great [[Gold|golden]] serpent miles long whose coils encircle the world. He also appears as a [[Dragon|dragon]] with night black scales, and is worshipped by [[Evil|evil]] dragons in this form.


## Relationships

> Apep is opposed by many other Osirian [[Deity|deities]], especially [[Ra]], who battles against him daily every night. Each sunrise was said to be a victory of Ra over Apep, albeit a temporary one until the day the sun will rise no more and everything ends.


## Cults

> Apep's [[Human|human]] cults usually meet under the cover of night or darkness, and keep themselves secret lest they attract the wrath of rival faiths.
