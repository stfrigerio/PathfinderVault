> **Lanishra** is the [[Orc|orc]] god of [[Slavery|slavery]] and tyranny, and delights when his followers capture other intelligent creatures and use them for entertainment, sacrifice, or food. He is somewhat opposed by the Blood God [[Nulgreth]] (who does not believe in leaving anyone alive), and the Despoiler, [[Verex]], who competes with him for slaves.
