> **Angradd** is the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[Demigod|demigod]] who aggressively seeks out threats to eliminate, in contrast with his brother [[Torag]], who is the [[Deity|god]] of defense and strategical thinking. Together with his older brother [[Magrim]], he watches over battles and decides the destinies of dwarven [[Soul|spirits]].



## Home

> Angradd lives in the Tempering Chamber beneath [[Heaven]], near Magrim's Cloister within Forgeheart, directly between Heaven and the [[Abyss]]. There he stands guard against any [[Demon|demons]] who would attack Heaven from below, buying time for the rest of Heaven to muster their forces.


## Appearance

> Angradd is often depicted as a radiant blond, bearded, powerfully built dwarf, wearing crimson and [[Gold|gold]] [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] and carrying a burning [[Greataxe|greataxe]].


## Relationships

> Angradd's older brothers view their youngest brother as rash, yet his sister [[Dranngvit]] considers him unnecessarily prudent. Magrim also finds that Angradd places too much emphasis on [[Good|good]] over [[Law|law]], but the entire dwarven pantheon respect him for his dedication in the fight against their enemies.


## Servants

> Most of Angradd's minions are [[Archon|archons]], most commonly [[Lantern archon|lantern archons]]. The Bright Lady of Strategy, mightiest of them all, is trusted by Angradd to command his troops in his absence. He also employs many [[Azer|azers]], who forge [[Weapon|weapons]] that his men wield in battle against [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]].


## Cults

> Angradd's faithful seek out and oppose [[Evil|evil]] wherever they can, and often compare themselves to a purifying flame that gains strength as it burns more foes. Against strong foes, they plan for a strategy and patiently build their strength and alliances for the chance of victory. Those worshippers who can no longer fight on the front line become trainers, preparing others to succeed them.
> Dwarves will offer prayers and sacrifices to Angradd if they are about to begin an offensive battle. [[Divine magic|Divine casters]] who revere the Forge-Fire as their patron deity have access to a special [[Spell|spell]] named *planned assault*, which provides them with extra protection in combat as long as they can plan ahead.
