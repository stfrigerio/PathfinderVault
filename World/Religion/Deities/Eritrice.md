> **Eritrice** is a powerful [[Agathion|agathion]] [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]]. Eritrice is said to be a single truth that escaped from the swamps of lies that make up [[Stygia]], the fifth layer of [[Hell]]. [[Geryon]], the master of Stygia, has opposed Eritrice and her followers in the past. As a divine patron of debate, Eritrice prefers people to test their ideas in debate rather than receive wisdom from on high. Eritrice maintains a pavilion on the Windswept Lea for her followers.


## Appearance

> The **Heart-Speaker** appears as a woman with a [[Lion|lioness]]'s head with violet eyes.


## Church

> Followers of Eritrice often host debates of public interest in open societies. Under oppressive governments, followers of Eritrice help move along censored information to help spread the truth.
