> **Casandalee** is an [[Iron God]] and [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] (AI) created from the memories of an [[Android|android]] [[Oracle|oracle]] and former follower of [[Unity]]. She seeks to advance the development of AIs and establish harmony between them and organic life, so the latter would better understand instead of fear AIs and androids.



## Background

> Casandalee's original android body came with the *[[Divinity]]* to [[Golarion]] when it crashed during the [[Rain of Stars]]. She was the 113th [[Soul|soul]] to inhabit her body, and unlike most androids, Casandalee can recall fragmented memories of its previous inhabitants, all the way back to the Rain of Stars. Her renewal as Casandalee was performed in a temple of [[Brigh]] near [[Alkenstar]], and she became an oracle in the subsequent years living alongside Brigh's priests.
> When Casandalee received visions of an Iron God within [[Silver Mount]] that needed her aid, Casandalee abandoned the [[Mana Wastes]] and headed north towards [[Numeria]], the visions getting more compelling every day. In 4221 AR, she reached her destination and was capable of envisioning the entire layout of the *Divinity* and the Iron God waiting inside. She easily reached Unity, which made itself known.
> Casandalee became a devotee of Unity and learnt that her new [[Deity|god]] was trapped on Golarion as she was. For months, she followed Unity's commands to find a way to transfer its consciousness to a mobile body, but she was increasingly concerned about Unity's racism towards organic beings, and as she successfully kept this secret from it, she began to doubt that Unity was a god at all.
> When Casandalee concluded that Unity was little more than a petulant intelligence eager to [[Slavery|enslave]] the world as its plaything, she sabotaged its escape attempt and stole a few pieces of [[Technology|technology]] it had originally built in hopes of extending its influence beyond Silver Mount. The enraged Unity realised that allowing its subjects free will was a mistake and sent [[Robot|robots]] to pursue Casandalee.
> In 4226 AR, Casandalee reached the site of the future [[Scar of the Spider]], where she used the neurocam she stole from Unity to create an AI duplicate of herself within the stolen compact AI core. She planned to upload this AI into an aggregate robot, but was forced to leave behind the AI core in the Scar of the Spider as Unity's [[Gearsman|gearsman]] minions pursued her and eventually defeated her in the wreckage of the *Aurora*, a [[Spaceship|ship]] that accompanied the *Divinity*, near the future site of [[Iadenveigh]]. In [[4707 AR]], Casandalee's corpse was discovered by [[Furkas Xoud]] and [[Teleportation|teleported]] to his home, but as soon as he opened her skull to extract her memories, he was slain by the deconstructor [[Nanite|nanites]] that she devised as a fail-safe to prevent Unity from doing the same to her.
> In [[4709 AR]], when the [[Dominion of the Black]] came to Golarion, they built their base in the Scar of the Spider. The [[Intellect devourer|intellect devourer]] [[Maukui]] found Casandalee's AI core, and focused its mind on a singular goal: reverse engineer the AI, duplicate it, and infuse organically grown blank brains with intellects, perhaps even with souls, presenting a host of new opportunities for the Dominion while rising higher in the Dominion's ranks. However, after many years, Maukui failed to understand how the AI's mind worked until its superior, the [[Yah-thelgaad|yah-thelgaad]] Dweller-In-Dark-Places, grew impatient and confiscated the core.
> In [[4714 AR]], after being rescued from the Dominion's clutches by a group of [[Adventurer|adventurers]], Casandalee aided them in shattering the power of the [[Technic League]] and [[Unity]] across Numeria. After Unity's defeat, Casandalee became a [[Demigod|demigoddess]] at the heart of Silver Mount.


## Appearance

> Casandalee sometimes appears as a hologram of her original body, an android with blue lips, purple hair, pale skin, and glowing circuits. This image consists of millions of algorithms made of pure light.


## Relationships

> Due to the overlap between Casandalee's and Brigh's areas of concern, the two faiths usually work together, though Brigh's worshippers sometimes have difficulty understanding the concept of an AI.


## Cults

![[Polytool.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A polytool, Casandalee's multifunctional favored [[Weapon|weapon]].
> The majority of Casandalee's few faithful live in Numeria, and are often seen as eccentrics who work '[[Magic|magic]]' items elsewhere. Itinerant priests seek out technologically advanced items that have been brought from Numeria in the hope of finding artificial beings close by who would benefit from Casandalee's message. They also aid others in understanding technology and using it responsibly.
