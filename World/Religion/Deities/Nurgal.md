*This article is about the [[Demon lord|demon lord]]; for the [[Infernal duke|infernal duke]], see [[Nergal]].*
> One of the [[Deity|gods]] of the [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]], the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] **Nurgal** was associated with warfare and the [[Sun|sun]]. His worship went into major decline in the [[Age of Darkness]]. Nurgal is an exception to the usual rule that the sun is associated with [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|benevolent]] deities and a force for good in the world. For those that fear the sun or enjoy its capability for destruction, the worship of Nurgal beckons.



## History

> Nurgal's faith was one of the strongest in [[Azlant]], and [[Archaeology|archaeological]] studies have found evidence of Nurgal's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] and other representations of the deity. During this time, in divine hierarchy, he was a true god.
> During the Eversiege of Aucharan, Nurgal's nemesis [[Acavna]] came to the aid of an [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azata]] fortress cast adrift into the [[Maelstrom]] by Nurgal's forces. They battled atop the fortress, and Acavna emerged victorious. She clove him in two and sent both parts tumbling into the Maelstrom. The lesser half fell into [[Hell]] and became the [[Infernal duke|infernal duke]] [[Nergal]]; the greater half plummeted into the [[Abyss]], and became a demon lord that retained the name Nurgal. So a full god became two [[Demigod|demigods]].


## Home

> Since falling into the Abyss, Nurgal has claimed the sun-blasted [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Kuthan]] as his own.


## Appearance

> Nurgal's head and lower body is that of a golden [[Lion|lion]] with his midriff that of a tanned, [[Humanoid|humanoid]] male. He has a [[Dragon|dragons]] tail and intense light is emitted from his eyes and mouth.
> Nurgal's signature [[Weapon|weapon]] is a [[Heavy mace|heavy mace]] with a small sun acting as its head. In images of the demon lord, he is invariably wielding this weapon.


## Relationships


### As a god

> Nurgal's nemesis was the [[Moon Golarion|moon]] goddess Acavna, patron of defensive tactics that were employed against his own brutality in warfare.


### As a demigod

> Nurgal's realm of Kuthan is connected to the Abyssal realm called the [[Sea of Whispering Sands]] as that realm was once ruled by [[Areshkagal]], Nurgal's lover. Areshkagal's sister, [[Aldinach]], however, fought and forced Areshkagal into exile in her current realm of the [[Blood Clefts]].
> Some rumours paint Nurgal as the half brother of [[Socothbenoth]], the Silken Sin, which contradict his actual history; however, lineage and bloodline might have been muddled by the raw [[Chaos|chaos]] of the Abyss. In any case, this relationship has meant war between the two for all their history.
> His lesser half [[Nergal]] has maintained a seething jealousy toward Nurgal.


## Cult and worshippers


### Ancient cults of the god

> Nurgal was one of the first deities worshipped by the Azlanti, when they were still barbarous clans vying for land. As these clans became city-states and eventually provinces, wars to decide the borders were constant, creating a ripe field for Nurgal's worship. Much of the senseless slaughter was conducted by armies and mercenaries who followed Nurgal. Some scholars speculate that worship of Nurgal spread to Azlant from [[Ninshabur]], before either empire rose to power.
> After Azlant became an empire, Nurgal's cult held numerous positions of power, and was particularly feared in the long, dry summers of southern Azlant. Some soldiers and mercenaries continued to pray to him before battles. Open worship of Nurgal was frowned upon among rank-and-file soldiers but tolerated by the officers, and secret cabals regularly met to perform obediences and vile rites to him in exchange for success.


### Modern cults of the demon lord

> In modern [[Golarion]], Nurgal's worship is far less than at the height of his power in ancient Azlant. However, cults of his worshippers are found in the deserts of northern [[Garund]], [[Qadira]], and the ruins of [[Ninshabur]]. Surprisingly, considering their susceptibility to sunlight, Nurgal is one of the demon lords most often worshipped by [[Orc|orcs]]. Their worship tends to emphasise his role as a god of senseless warfare rather than as a sun deity and is most common amongst orcs who dwell in Garund.
