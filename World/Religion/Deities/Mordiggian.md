> **Mordiggian** is the [[Great Old One]] of darkness, [[Ghoul|ghouls]], and the voices of the dead.



## History

> Mordiggian's age cannot be reliably tracked, as he can move back and forth in [[Time|time]]. As far as one can look into the past or future, his cult can be found.


## Appearance

> Mordiggian appears as a mobile cloud of darkness with no fixed shape. His favoured corporeal form is that of an immense graveworm or a limbless [[Giant|giant]] made of darkness with solid tentacles, in which he manifests to eat or punish those who trespass in his temples.


## Church of Mordiggian

> Mordiggian was once the patron of all ghouls, but most of them have since forgotten him and converted to the worship of other death [[Deity|gods]]. Only pockets of [[Leng ghoul|Leng ghouls]] continue to maintain their ancient rites. Most of Mordiggian's modern followers are [[Human|humans]] who deformed themselves to resemble ghouls, and hide these features under [[Silver|silver]] masks and heavy cloaks.
> Mordiggian's temples are either hidden vaults under graveyards, or great mausoleums in positions of prominence in cities. Priests of Mordiggian collect the dead in such cities for free and feed them to Mordiggian in their sacred vaults. Sometimes they are too eager to gather the 'dead', and also take the comatose, despite their potential of recovery.


## Relationships

> Mordiggian's cult considers ghouls who have converted to the worship of other [[Deity|deities]], like [[Kabriri]], heretics and seeks to exterminate them everywhere they can be found.
