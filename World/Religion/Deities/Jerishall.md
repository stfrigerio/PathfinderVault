> **Jerishall** is an agender [[Primordial inevitable|primordial inevitable]] who monitors the movement of [[Celestial body|celestial bodies]], ensuring that they maintain their orbits and do not violate physical laws, so that civilisation can flourish on them. Jerishall is also concerned with [[Plane|interplanar]] interactions and seeks to limit a [[Plane|planes]] influence from altering the physics on another.


## Home

> Jerishall's home is a great [[Observatory|observatory]] floating above [[Axis]].


## Cults

> Jerishall encourages the development of [[Technology|technology]], [[Astronomy|astronomy]], and astrophysics so that civilisations can learn to redirect wayward planetary bodies, like [[Asteroid|asteroids]], and escape catastrophic collisions without having to utterly destroy the dangerous celestial object, something that Jerishall does not condone. For this reason, Jerishall is a patron of [[Space travel|space travel]] and is respected by starfarers like [[Witchwyrd|witchwyrds]] or even [[Elder thing|elder things]].
> Jerishall's followers often keep [[Planar portal|planar portals]] in check, ensuring that they do not become invasive upon other regions.
