> **Brumash** is the name the [[Orc|orcs]] of the [[Dead Eye tribe]] give to the deity they worship. They believe him to be the father of [[Rovagug]] and the entire orc race, and look down on all other orc deities as newcomers, usurpers, and upstarts, and gleefully oppose their worshipers at every turn. Some academics speculate that Brumash might be a gestalt of [[Verex|Verex the Blood God]] and [[Zagresh|Zagresh the Destroyer]].
