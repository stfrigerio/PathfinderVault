> The [[Demon lord|demon lord]] **Xoveron** (pronounced ZOV-er-ahn) is the patron lord of [[Gargoyle|gargoyles]] and is worshiped by them. He is also patron of the fearsome [[Nabasu|nabasu]] [[Demon|demons]] who perpetrate cruelty on his victims.



## Background

> Xoveron, as demon lord of ruins, loathes vibrant cities and his goal is to destroy all of them and rule over the innumerable ruins that would cause.


### Unholy symbol

> Xoveron's unholy symbol is a five-horned grey gargoyle skull missing its lower jaw.


## Home

> Xoveron's [[Abyssal realm]] is [[Ghahazi]], a vast, ruined metropolis.


## Appearance

> Like many demon lords who serve as a race's patrons, Xoveron resembles the gargoyles that worship him, but is far larger than normal gargoyles. He also possesses a unique additional pair of arms and four heads. It is thought that he can see through the eyes of any gargoyle perched upon ruined buildings anywhere in the [[Great Beyond]] and, in this way, choose his next target to torment.


## Cult and worshipers

> Xoveron is primarily worshiped by gargoyles as well as the demonic nabasu. He demands that sacrifices to him are performed by defenestration or by impaling the victim on tall stakes under the open, uncaring sky. Xoveron's greater ambition, and one shared by most of his worshipers, is the complete destruction of all civilizations, leaving him as the undisputed ruler of all the countless ruined cities left behind. One may see a premonition of this goal in Xoveron's Abyssal realm of Ghahazi: a shadow of what destruction Xoveron will wreak on the rest of the [[Material Plane]].
