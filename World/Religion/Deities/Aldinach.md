> **Aldinach** (pronounced ALL-di-nach) is the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of sand, thirst and [[Scorpion|scorpions]]. Her [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is an image of a gold [[Scorpion|scorpion]] with sand dripping from its claws.



## Appearance

> Aldinach's primary form is that of an enormous, golden scorpion as large as a house, with crimson, crystalline, razor-sharp claws and a hideous [[Human|human]] face with an unwholesome complexion. Her towering carapace is covered with members of her endless brood: countless smaller scorpions she can control by thought. Her sting is particularly deadly, injecting six [[Venom|venoms]] reputed to be lethal even to those immune to toxins.


## History and relationships

> Aldinach is one of [[Lamashtu|Lamashtus]] daughters from the time before the Mother of Monsters became a [[God|goddess]], but there has been little contact between them since the mother's ascension. On the other hand, Aldinach's [[Sphinx|sphinx]]-like half-sister, [[Areshkagal]], has been at constant war with Aldinach since the Lord of Scorpions stole the [[Abyssal realm]] known as the [[Sea of Whispering Sands]], several thousand years ago. Areshkagal, desperate to regain her lost home, has sent waves of armies from the [[Blood Clefts]], where she rules in exile.


## Abyssal realm

> Aldinach rules over the Sea of Whispering Sands, a near-endless desert landscape, dotted with abandoned cities.


## Worshipers and followers

> Aldinach has few followers on the [[Material Plane]], but since she is the demon lord of sand and scorpions, she has cults in [[Osirion|Osirions]] and [[Rahadoum|Rahadoums]] desert areas, as well as in the deserts of central [[Casmaron]]. Her followers prefer to congregate in the temples of abandoned cities, while in more civilized regions, they congregate underground in burrows and caves. Some violent half-scorpion [[Girtablilu|girtablilu]] tribes in eastern Osirion syncretically worship Aldinach and [[Rovagug]], often led by half-fiend clerics. She has no organized worship outside of [[Garund|Garunds]] desert regions.
> Monsters associated with her include the scorpion-like [[Gharros demon|gharros demon]], and the "double scorpion" [[Sandwalker|sandwalkers]].


### Obedience

> Some of her faithful are granted special power after lying prone in sand and eating scorpions.
