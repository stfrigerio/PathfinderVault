> **Lysianassa** is the [[Good|good]] [[Elemental lord|elemental lord]] of the [[Plane of Water]], currently imprisoned in the *[[Gasping Pearl]]*.



## History

> In the [[Age of Creation]], when [[Mortality|mortals]] began to use the [[Element|elements]] for [[Evil|evil]], the good elemental lords began to squabble, for instance, Lysianassa blaming [[Atreia]] for enabling arson. In the meantime, Lysianassa's evil rival [[Kelizandri]] gathered his fellow evil elemental lords and worked together to defeat and imprison the good ones. Before she was sealed away, Lysianassa preserved her strength inside *[[The Breath of Lysianassa]]*, which allowed her nautilus servant Riam the Unyielding to control the Plane of Water's currents. Lysianassa tasked Riam with governing the oceans in her place. Her plan was discovered by Kelizandri, who dispatched nine [[Brine dragon|brine dragons]] to pursue Riam and they mortally wounded the nautilus. With no one to control the *Breath of Lysianassa*, the currents of the Plane of Water began to slowly stagnate.


## Appearance

> Lysianassa looks like a sailfish made of coral and streaked with mother-of-pearl.


## Cults

> In recent years, many [[Water naga|water nagas]] have made a pilgrimage to Savisura, an ancient, long-forgotten temple to Lysianassa. They claim that the haunting, indistinct voices echoing throughout the temple are uttered by a [[Deity|godlike]] creature called the Queen of the Depths, and that her chosen few can bring forth an event they call the Awakening. Some scholars believe that this Queen of the Depths is Lysianassa, and the nagas and similar cults across the Plane of Water are seeking to free her.
