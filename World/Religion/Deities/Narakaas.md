> **Narakaas** is an agender [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp usher]] born from the pieces of [[Soul|souls]] discarded by [[Mortality|mortals]]. The Cleansing Sentence represents the countless choices and sacrifices made during a lifetime, and understands that a broken or repaired thing is no less valuable, but simply different and sometimes even more precious due to its history. Narakaas offers undecided souls a last chance to choose between [[Good|good]] and [[Evil|evil]], and judges good [[Mortal|mortals]] that committed evil acts due to their beliefs and convictions.



## Home

> Menagerel, Narakaas' realm, is a patchwork place assembled from countless painful memories of home.


## Appearance

> Narakaas appears as a patchwork, androgynous [[Humanoid|humanoid]] with [[Stag|stag]] legs, held together by golden light. Their face is featureless save for expressionless eyes and streaks of tears.


## Relationships

> Although Narakaas accepts pain and the ensuing growth, creatures that revel in pain like [[Velstrac|velstracs]] are anathema to them. However, the Cleansing Sentence is an optimistic creature, and has redeemed a few velstracs and taken them into its service.
