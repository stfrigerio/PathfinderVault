 The [[Four Horsemen]] ride out with Apollyon on the far right.
> **Apollyon** (pronounced uh-POL-yuhn) is the [[Ram|ram]]-headed [[Four Horsemen|Horseman of Pestilence]] and one of the most powerful archdaemons in [[Abaddon]]. Sometimes referred to as the Prince of Locusts, Apollyon sends forth [[Plague|plagues]] and [[Disease|diseases]] throughout the [[Plane|planes]] in an effort to increase his power above his fellow archdaemons.



## Appearance

> Apollyon generally appears as a pockmarked man with the head of a sickly ram.  His cloak is fashioned from the flayed skin of a dozen [[Angel|angels]], each of whom had invaded Abaddon to kill the Horseman and free the damned [[Soul|souls]] under his control.


## History

> Apollyon became the Horseman of Pestilence when his predecessor, [[Yrsinius]], vanished in the [[Maelstrom]]. After their master's disappearance, Yrsinius' minions fought among themselves until Apollyon emerged as the victor; half of his rivals died to his blows, while the others fled to serve the other Horsemen, withdrew into the unclaimed parts of Abaddon, or left the [[Plane|plane]] entirely.  While it is rumored that Yrsinius was killed by the [[Protean|protean]] [[Chorus of Malignant Symmetry]], this has not been proven; the other three Horsemen nonetheless rode on the Maelstrom and slaughtered a number of choruses and a protean elder, then deposited the elder's corpse in the [[Plaguemere]] to rot, where it remains to this day.


## Realm

> He rules from the [[Throne of Flies]], a palace and throne thought to be the body of a dead [[Godling|godling]], located in the festering pits and shriveled forests of the Plaguemere.


## Relationships

> Apollyon's cults consider [[Evil|evil]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]], as well as the cults of [[Rovagug]], [[Urgathoa]], and [[Ghlaunder]] allies. However, Ghlaunder is aware of the [[Daemon|daemons]]' goal to exterminate the [[Great Beyond|universe]] and knows that their relationship will end in hostility.


## Servants

> Among the creatures under his control are his [[Deacon|deacons]]: the sinister [[Leukodaemon|leukodaemons]], whom he sends into the world to collect souls on his behalf. He also occasionally allies himself with a race of disease-loving [[Div|div]] known as the [[Pairaka|pairaka]]. Apollyon, along with [[Trelmarixian]], has a large following among the [[Daemon-spawn|daemon-spawn]] [[Urdefhan|urdefhan]], whom he entrusts with spreading the diseases he and his servitors develop.
> The white [[Apocalypse horse|apocalypse horse]] [[Septisaeus]] serves as Apollyon's mount. Particularly favored servitors may also receive one of the *[[Usher of the Black Rain|Ushers of the Black Rain]]* [[Bow|bows]] empowered by the Horseman with fragments of the souls of the angels flayed alive to fashion his cloak.


## Worship

> [[Mortal]] cultists of Apollyon know that the Horseman values results more than their adoration.


### Obedience

> Devoted worshipers of the Horseman of Pestilence can gain special powers by actively spreading disease through a population by any number of vectors, including handing out contaminated clothing and bedding, fouling water supplies, or personally acting as a carrier.


### Unholy Symbol

> His [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a diseased-looking yellow scythe, covered in boils, polyps, and fleshy tendrils.
