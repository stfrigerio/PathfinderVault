> Cruel **Ovonovo**, a [[Nascent demon lord|nascent demon lord]], is a [[Ship|ship-sized]] [[Shark|shark]] that is able to take [[Human|human]] form. While in human form, Ovonovo delights in getting aboard ships only to run them aground so she can feast first on the panic and fear of the sinking sailors, and then on the flesh of the dying sailors in shark form as she returns to the sea.
> Ovonovo's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a ship being swallowed by an immense shark.


## Cult and worshipers

> Ovonovo has a small but dedicated following of [[Orc|orc]] and [[Half-orc|half-orc]] worshippers. [[Shackles|The Shackles]] are known to be home to at least three separate [[Pirate|pirate]] ships crewed by orc followers who pay Ovonovo bloody homage.
