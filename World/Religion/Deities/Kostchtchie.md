> Born a mortal [[Human|man]] of [[Ulfen]] stock before being [[Curse|cursed]], **Kostchtchie** (pronounced KOSH-chuh-chai or kosh-TIK-ti-kai) is now the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of [[Giant|giants]] and biting cold. His [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is an ice-rimed, rune-carved [[Warhammer|warhammer]].



## History

> Kostchtchie was not always a [[Demon|demon]]: once he was an Ulfen man from the land of [[Iobaria]] who hated women and giants and had a violent temper. His father raised him barbarically, forcing him to slaughter his own mother and sister, but in time, the savage Kostchtchie murdered his father as well. Much of the rest of his [[Mortal|mortal]] life is lost in myth and fable. The next event of which scholars are certain, is the beginning of his unholy ascendency.
> Kostchtchie sought [[Immortality|immortality]] by forcing a bargain with the [[Baba Yaga|Witch Queen Baba Yaga]]. As is often the case with such arrangements, Kostchtchie's wish for immortality was twisted by the [[Evil|evil]] crone, and he found himself transformed into the demonic form of the thing that he hated most: a giant. Baba Yaga also hid an element of his mortal [[Soul|soul]] in a torc, known as the *[[Torc of Kostchtchie]]*. The defeated Kostchtchie then fled to the [[Abyss]] to lick his wounds and, since that time, Kostchtchie has turned his hatred towards Baba Yaga and humanity itself. He wages constant war on the tribes of Iobaria, and seeks to conquer and destroy the nation of [[Irrisen]], ruled by the many daughters of Baba Yaga herself. His interest in Irrisen is associated with the recovery of the *Torc* that holds part of his soul as he considers the *Torc* may cure his deformity while maintaining his immortality. While he sometimes campaigns by proxy, Kostchtchie prefers to enter combat in person. For example, according to the eponymous *[[Record of Truan Iolavai]]*, he took personal interest in [[Truan Iolavai|Iolavais]] investigation of [[Hask-Ultharan]] in the great pine forest of Iobaria.


## Home

> Kostchtchie's home is **Skyscar**, a huge castle hewn out of a mountain within the [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Jhuvumirak]], which he took when he defeated [[Sithhud]] in battle.


## Appearance

> While he was once a man, it is very hard to see any trace of humanity in Kostchtchie's current form. He appears as an immense [[Frost giant|frost giant]] with legs perversely twisted and an obscenely muscular frame. His head is small, looking very strange compared to his hulking body. Two tiny, pure white eyes look out from above a massive white beard woven with the skulls of kings and defeated champions of other faiths. He always wields his massive [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]] warhammer.


## Cult and worshipers

> Kostchtchie's main worshipers are frost giants who have turned from the worship of their traditional [[Deities|deities]], particularly [[Thremyr]], and instead embraced the demonic as being a more aggressive [[Philosophy|philosophy]]. Some claim that these frost giant worshipers of Kostchtchie are even more war-like and blood-thirsty than their already fearsome frost giant kin. Despite his general hatred of humans, Kostchtchie does have many human worshipers, particularly in the western reaches of the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]]. They pray for the day when he will finally bring destruction upon their most hated enemy, the realm of Irrisen. He also has worshippers in [[Iobaria]] and the [[Crown of the World]].


### Unholy text

> Kostchtchie's unholy text is *[[The Tale of the Deathless Frost]]* usually written in spiralling runes on stone, making it very heavy. To overcome this problem, the short stories are often learnt and told orally. It contains a history of Kostchtchie's ascent to immortal power, where the story of Baba Yaga is twisted from the truth. It also contains his three commandments to his faithful:

> - Avenge Yourself Times Three
> - Bow to No Woman
> - Kill All Witches

## Relations with other religions

> Being a mere demon lord, Kostchtchie does not often trouble the greater [[Deity|gods]] with the exception of [[Iomedae]] (see below). His relations tend to be with the other denizens of the Abyss.


### Inimical relationships

Dagon
As [[Dagon]] is lord of deformity, Kostchtchie hates him seeing the echoes of his own deformation.
Iomedae
Kostchtchie seems to have evoked the particular ire of the powerful goddess, Iomedae, for his hatred of women and just the fact he is a demon lord and murderer.
Mestama
[[Mestama]] is the patron of [[Hag|hags]] and [[Witch|witches]] and, in line with Kostchtchie's desire to annihilate such women, he seeks opportunities to destroy her followers with glee.

### Neutral relationships

Lamashtu
Kostchtchie avoids [[Lamashtu]] due to her greater power and so takes no side in Lamashtu's war with Pazuzu.
Nocticula
Kostchtchie desires [[Nocticula]] with a passion and wants to conquer to make her his concubine.
Pazuzu
Kostchtchie avoids [[Pazuzu]] due to his greater power and so takes no side in Pazuzu's war with Lamashtu.
Thremyr
Rather than the expected animosity to the god [[Thremyr]] after taking many of his followers from him, Kostchtchie just ignores this power who seems indifferent to Kostchtchie's poaching of his erstwhile faithful.
