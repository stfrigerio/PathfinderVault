> **Tawil at'Umr** is an unusual and little-known [[Great Old One]] that serves as the physical projection of the [[Outer God]] [[Yog-Sothoth|Yog-Sothoths]] will and pursues Yog-Sothoth's goals across the dimensions. It is theorised that Tawil at'Umr is little more than the side effect of Yog-Sothoth brushing up against this [[Material Plane|universe]]. Tawil at'Umr has vast knowledge about reality, including how to travel to the [[Dimension of Time]], but the cost of such knowledge is terrible.


## Appearance

> Tawil at'Umr appears as a cloaked figure of approximately the same shape as and larger size than the observer. Under the cloak, it is revealed as a seething protoplasmic mass capable of taking many shapes, several of which should not be able to exist.


## Cult

> Devotees of Tawil at'Umr typically worship it out of a mistaken impression that worship matters to the avatar. No cult of Tawil at'Umr is known to exist. Most who would venerate it instead worship its true form Yog-Sothoth.
