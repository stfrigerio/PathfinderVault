> The [[Queen of the Night]] **Doloras** is a former [[Angel|angel]] who joined [[Asmodeus|Asmodeuss]] revolt aeons ago and fled with him to [[Hell]]. She made a deal with the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Mephistopheles]] and now holds an honored position in [[Caina]] where she preaches the abandonment of emotion for an unfeeling indifference. Her [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a necklace or tiara adorned with blue and red tear-shaped jewels.



## Appearance

> Still possessing a debased beauty, Doloras's skin seems to be made of [[Iron|iron]], with eyes as black as anthracite, and razor-sharp fingers. Her angelic wings are interlaced with needles and a crown of tears adorns her hairless head.


## History

> When she was still a [[Planetar|planetar]] angel, Doloras once served as a general under [[Erastil]], and was tasked with defending [[Heaven]] from a [[Demon|demonic]] incursion of the [[Summerlands]]. When the demons took her brothers captive, Doloras followed them into the [[Abyss]] alone. Once she found a group of demons she thought responsible, Doloras chained them up and tortured them for 66 days for her brothers' whereabouts.
> Doloras quickly lost any moral concerns about her deeds and became inured to the screams and pleas of the tortured demons. She enjoyed the torture so much that she continued even after having learnt that these demons did not kidnap her brothers. Three angels of Heaven found her and informed her that her brothers were now safe; Doloras murdered all of them, enjoying the feeling of cutting them down and telling herself that they were disguised [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]].
> The demons succumbed to Doloras' tortures shortly after the third angel was murdered. She discovered that her body had changed, and when she came back to Heaven, she found herself *persona non grata*. She realised that she no longer cared about her brothers, who never learnt the truth about her fate and assume that she is dead to this day.
> Still finding [[Chaos|chaos]] inimical, Doloras chose to seek her new home in Hell, where she found the chained [[Velstrac|velstracs]] and freed them. She was eventually offered a home in [[Caina]] by its lord, Mephistopheles.


## Relationships

> Doloras is an ally of Mephistopheles, who gave her a spire of her choice in Caina and all she needed to outfit it; in return Doloras tortures specific [[Soul|souls]] at Mephistopheles' demand.
> Doloras was willing to ally with the other Queens of the Night when [[Eiseth]] gathered them; she wished to torture whichever captives she wanted, and the others happily accepted. Doloras trades [[Science|science]] and suffering with [[Mahathallah]] for mysteries of nature and the cosmos in a distant, but mutually beneficial, relationship.
> While all velstracs owe her a debt for freeing them from Hell and allowing them to escape to the [[Shadow Plane]], Doloras has an especially deep relationship with the [[Velstrac demagogue|velstrac demagogue]] [[Inkariax]]. He built his divine realm in a place where he felt an empathic link with Doloras, who shortly after visited his realm and gifted him with frozen tears from her crown before wordlessly departing. Inkariax named his realm Frozen Tears after this gift, builds it in her honour, and seeks to earn her favour. Their followers closely cooperate with each other; it is unknown if Doloras wants to test Inkariax, destroy him, or take her time to ally with him.
