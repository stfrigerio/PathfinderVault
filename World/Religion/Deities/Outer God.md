> The **Outer Gods** are a pantheon of utterly alien, unfathomably ancient, poorly understood [[Deity|deities]] that exist outside of reality itself, or the concepts of faith, [[Soul|souls]], and [[Quintessence|quintessence]]. They are often grouped alongside the [[Great Old One|Great Old Ones]], who are [[Demigod|demigods]] akin to [[Archdevil|archdevils]] or [[Demon lord|demon lords]], under the collective umbrella of the **Elder Mythos**, or **gods of the [[Dark Tapestry]]**. The Great Old Ones respect the Outer Gods and may be seen as [[Herald|heralds]] or high priests of their greater kind.
> According to many scholars (including [[Tabris]], who calls them **Those Who Remain** in the *[[Concordance of Rivals]]*), the Outer Gods are so ancient that they predate the [[Great Beyond]] and [[Pharasma]], and thus the concept of [[Mortality|mortality]] itself. Many Pharasmins consider this to be blasphemous, but the truth may not be something they can accept.
> Most Outer Gods make their homes within the [[Material Plane]], in the [[Dark Tapestry]], the blackness between the [[Star|stars]]. They are much freer agents than the Great Old Ones, able to travel the Dark Tapestry, other parts of the universe, and even out of [[Time|time]] and reality.
> Outer Gods are of a vast, alien intelligence and perceive reality in such an inscrutable way that they cannot recognise their own actions as [[Evil|evil]]. For mortals, the differences between cults of the Outer Gods and Great Old Ones, collectively called the [[Old Cults]], are practically meaningless. Those who follow them and draw [[Divine magic|magical power]] from their worship are almost always [[Insane|insane]], believing that when the stars are right, these ancient beings will return to unmake the world. For their part, the Outer Gods are mostly unconcerned with mortal worship, and some do not even understand the concept of faith.
> The total number of Outer Gods is unknown, but individual gods are known to include [[Azathoth]], [[Yog-Sothoth]], [[Shub-Niggurath]], [[Nyarlathotep]], [[Abhoth]], and [[Nhimbaloth]].
