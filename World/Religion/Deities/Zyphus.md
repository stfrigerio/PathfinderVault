> **Zyphus** (pronounced ZIE-fess or ZAI-FUSS) is the malignant [[Deity|god]] of accidental death. A bitter enemy of the goddess [[Pharasma]], he is worshiped by small cults throughout [[Golarion]]. These groups foment tragedy and bring about accidents in the hopes of strengthening the power of their god. His [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a pick made from a [[Human|human]] skull, rib, and femur.

## History

> Followers of the Grim Harvestman believe that the god arose from the first maddened [[Soul|soul]] to die a pointless death. It is written that since that time, every [[Mortal|mortal]] that dies in the same meaningless way is destined to be absorbed by Zyphus after death. This puts him in direct competition with the goddess [[Pharasma]], and his followers believe that once he has acquired enough souls he will be able to engineer the death of Pharasma herself. Cults of Zyphus believe that even though the deaths they help arrange are not truly accidental, these souls are still dedicated to strengthen their patron.


## Home

> Zyphus' divine realm is located in a massive field of open tombs within Bloodrot, [[Urgathoa|Urgathoas]] home in [[Abaddon]]. He originally received it through a deal with [[Charon]], and the [[Daemon|daemons]] largely leave him alone.


## Relationships

> Zyphus views Urgathoa as his mentor, and shares many interests with her. He is trying to convince [[Naderi]] that chance can always take away one's loved one, in the process turning her toward [[Evil|evil]]. Most other gods view him as more of an annoyance than an actual threat; he is particularly opposed by [[Abadar]], [[Torag]], [[Brigh]], and especially [[Pharasma]]. His cults sometimes work alongside daemon worshippers, but are always wary of them.


## Church of Zyphus

> Zyphen cults are widespread, although never large in numbers. They worship in abandoned graveyards that are no longer under the protection of the Lady of Graves. His symbols are often found on arches or vaulted roofs of active graveyards as well but, used in this way, they are meant to ward off the Grim Harvestman. Recently, Zyphen cults have been active in [[Taldor]]. Zyphus has dictated no official text, but approves of his followers using the *[[Letters of Harsh Truth]]*, a collection of revelations about the folly of the gods, the dominance of chance, and how mortals should accept their inevitable and random deaths.
