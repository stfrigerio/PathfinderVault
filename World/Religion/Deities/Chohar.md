> **Chohar** is one of the three [[Old Sun Gods]] of [[Mzali]], the Lion God of justice, loyalty, and work. He is commonly depicted as a golden [[Lion|lion]] with a [[Sun|sun]] for a mane. Due to their shared love of justice, some priests of [[Walkena]] claim that the Child-God is a descendant of Chohar, even though Walkena's vindictive and cruel justice contrasts with Chohar's duty.
