> **Grandmother Spider** is known as a mythical figure in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] where she is thought to be a hoarder, and a tale about her is associated with *[[Bag of holding|bags of holding]]*. The legend tells of a young man given a *bag* by Grandmother Spider in exchange for him using it to collect every [[Animal|animal]] in the jungle and bringing them to her web. He instead left with the *bag*, which the legend claims is the reason why [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spiders]] of the Expanse are so hostile to [[Human|humans]].

### Holy text

*Old Woman Makes the Stars*
Written by the [[Anadi|anadi]] [[Cleric|cleric]] Raindrops-Sing-Her-Name Secha between the 2nd and 4th centuries [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]], this epic poem features the opening line shared among all of the many stories of Grandmother Spider: "This I have heard, and heard once more, and so I think it true."

### Holidays

First Rain
Celebrated on the first rainy day of each summer—because of Grandmother Spider's renowned hatred of rain—followers of Grandmother Spider celebrate indoors to entertain each other for hours.
Longwalk
The long, dark night of [[Nurvatcha|Nurvatchas]] [[Winter solstice|winter solstice]] is celebrated as a day of freedom, in part thanks to Grandmother Spider lengthening their cover of darkness in their escape.
