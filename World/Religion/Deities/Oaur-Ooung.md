> **Oaur-Ooung** is an aquatic [[Qlippoth lord|qlippoth lord]] and the horrifically fecund mother of countless [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] hordes.



## Appearance

> Oaur-Ooung resembles a gigantic, pale, [[Poison|poisonous]] [[Fungus|fungoid]] creature swelling with blisters. Her main body is 120 feet long, and if necessary her twitching tendrils can stretch like those of a [[Jellyfish|jellyfish]] for miles.


## Home

> Oaur-Ooung drifts in a toxic, impossibly deep, and immense [[Abyss|Abyssal]] ocean that she shares with numerous smaller leviathans. She keeps no lair for herself and spends her time spawning an endless number of qlippoth. Some drown or are eaten by Oaur-Ooung, but countless others escape.


## Cults

> Oaur-Ooung's cultists, who usually live on desolate coastlines or near [[Ship|shipwrecks]], believe that the qlippoth will eventually achieve their goal. The cultists want to be transformed into qlippoth and live on, and do not care about losing their memories and personalities in the process. Many reject their racial identities to modify their bodies, and sacrifices to Oaur-Ooung are often subjected to [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]] designed to evolve the faithful and consume their enemies.


## Relationships

> Oaur-Ooung is the mother of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Cyth-V'sug|Cyth-Vsug]], who was once a qlippoth lord. When he exhibited the first signs of transformation into a demon lord, it was she who noticed this change, threatened to destroy him, and forced him to flee to the upper Abyss. It is said that Oaur-Ooung is growing something new and unprecedentedly large in a blisterwomb.
