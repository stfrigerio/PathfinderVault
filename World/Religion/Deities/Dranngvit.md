> **Dranngvit** is the bitter [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[Deity|goddess]] of debt and vengeance, and is seen by her people as a necessary evil rather than a beloved deity. Most dwarves make offerings to her only when they know they have wronged someone, and only those who are consumed by hatred and vengeance choose her as a patron. Even though she oversees the righting of wrongs, most believe her to be more interested in vengeance than justice.



## Relations

> Dranngvit is [[Torag|Torags]] half-sister, although some legends claim she was supposed to have been Torag's wife but lost out to [[Folgrit]]. Dranngvit may be the mother of [[Kols]], but even if she is, Folgrit still treats Kols like her son. The Debt Minder gets along well with her half-brother [[Magrim]], who helps her encourage dwarves to enact their vengeance within their lifetimes so that their unfinished business does not cause them to rise as [[Undead|undead]]. She has poor relations with all the other [[DwarfReligion|gods of her pantheon]], although she does have some sympathy for [[Droskar]].


## Dranngvit on Golarion

> One of the eight levels of the dwarven [[Sky citadel|sky citadel]] of [[Koldukar]] was dedicated to Dranngvit. After it was overrun by the [[Orc|orcs]] of the [[Hold of Belkzen]] in [[-3709 AR]], this meaning was lost, although some of the structures dedicated to the goddess still stand today in what is now the city of [[Urgir]].


## Church of Dranngvit

> Although Dranngvit (along with [[Droskar]]) is one of the least revered gods on the Dwarven pantheon, she has a sizeable church and following in the sky citadel of [[Kraggodan]] on the border of [[Nirmathas]]. Members of her church are sometimes brought in to de-escalate disputes between the dwarven clans of [[Kraggodan]], especially when subtler, less direct methods are preferred. The arrival of Dranngvit's dour-faced interrogators has caused even the most hot-headed rabble rouser to reconsider their tactics.


### Worshipers

> She is particularly popular among the dour dwarven caravan guards of the [[Runtash River]] valley known as the Runtash Roughnecks. Their endless battles with the [[Giant|giants]] of the [[Mindspin Mountains]] causes them to forsake the more benign dwarven gods.
> Any dwarf who is convicted of a serious offense may call upon Dranngvit for atonement, but if she is unresponsive, the punishment is carried out.
