 A depiction of Acavna as she was worshiped by the Ancient Azlanti.
> **Acavna** is a now long-forgotten [[Deity|deity]] of the [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] people, who was dedicated to the [[Moon Golarion|moon]] and to defensive battle. She was kind and compassionate, and saw [[Human|humanity]] as something to be protected and cherished.



## History

> When Acavna learned of the [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]]' plan to destroy the continent, she was determined to make a stand to protect [[Golarion]] and her people from the incoming [[Earthfall]], refusing to stand down no matter what her lover [[Amaznen]] said. Acavna pulled [[Moon Golarion|Golarions moon]] from its orbit to intercept the massive [[Meteorite|meteorite]]. The impact with the moon shattered the world-killing projectile into thousands of pieces, but did not slow or deflect it from its course. Instead, its shards inflicted lethal wounds on the goddess' physical manifestation.
> Distraught by Acavna's death, Amaznen sacrificed himself to render the remaining deadly alghollthu [[Magic|magic]] clinging to the meteorite fragments inert, transforming it from a world-killer to one that, while still incredibly destructive, gave life on Golarion a chance to survive. When it impacted with Golarion, it completely obliterated the continent of [[Azlant]] and plunged the world into the [[Age of Darkness]], but did not cause the death of all life on Golarion thanks to Acavna and Amaznen.
> Acavna's corpse plummeted into the site of an abandoned [[Celwynvian]] [[Observatory|observatory]], obliterating the structure and penetrating deep into the [[Planet|planets]] crust. The [[Mordant Spire]] rose from her grave, formed from the essence of her [[Soul|soul]] as it attempted to reach [[Pharasma's Boneyard|Pharasmas Boneyard]]. The [[Mordant Spire elves|elves]] who currently inhabit the spire are said to be able to hear the whispers of Acavna even now, thousands of years after her death.
> After her death, her former [[Herald|herald]] Shieldwarden Olhondias used parts of Acavna's planar realm to shore up [[Basrakal]], the refuge for outcast [[Outsider|outsiders]] in the [[Maelstrom]].


## Relationships

> Acavna was the lover of Amaznen, the Azlanti god of magic, despite the mismatch in their outlooks. Prior to Earthfall, the future Last Azlanti and patron of humanity [[Aroden]] was a follower of Amaznen and Acavna. They were cited in Aroden's dogma as an example that gods could die, but humanity would live on.
> Acavna's arch-nemesis was [[Nurgal]], who personifies war's needless brutality in contrast to her own portfolio of defensive tactics. During the Eversiege of Aucharan, Acavna came to the aid of an [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azata]] fortress cast into the Maelstrom by Nurgal's forces. At the climax of the battle, Acavna clove Nurgal in two and sent both parts tumbling into the Maelstrom. These two remnants became the [[Infernal duke|infernal duke]] [[Nergal]] and a [[Demon lord|demon lord]] that retained the name of Nurgal.


## Cults

> [[Bilith-Vel]] was once Acavna's holy city. Hundreds of temples in the city were dedicated to her, outnumbering those of all other gods combined. Huge statues of Acavna stood shoulder-to-shoulder with towers and walkways; and lunar motifs dominated the architecture.
> An important story in Acavna's holy text tells of an assault on Bilith-Vel. When the attackers were approaching under the cover of night, a defending guard prayed to Acavna for a revelation to save the city. The crescent moon suddenly shone as bright as a full moon, allowing the defenders to see and repel the attackers.
> A few of Acavna's most powerful followers were among the first explorers of Golarion's moon. They strongly opposed the construction of the [[City of the Faceless]], a supermax prison built on the moon's surface, but ultimately failed to prevent the plan.
> The great [[Lunar dragon|lunar dragon]] Rezallian once served as Acavna's battle mount and closest confidant. He was absent when Acavna and Amaznen gave their lives to save Golarion from Earthfall, and his guilt over whether his participation might have been enough to save them eventually twisted him into an [[Animus shade|animus shade]].
> One of Acavna's few surviving temples is located near the ancient ruined Azlanti city of [[Saventh-Yhi]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].
