> The [[Avoral|avoral]] [[Agathion|agathion]] [[Empyreal Lord]] **Korada** (pronounced KOH-rah-dah) is a contemplative being. He spends his time in the Dream Lotus on the plane of [[Nirvana]], meditating, and communing with the enlightened.
> Worshipers are primarily monks and ascetics who sacrifice earthly pleasures in favour of a contemplative existence. They strive for the balance of mind, body and spirit in life, and are remarkably calm even in the midst of chaos.
> [[Balor]] lords, [[Demodand|demodand]] warlords, and even [[Infernal dukes|infernal dukes]] have lost their desire for conquest and war when the Open Hand of Harmony approaches them alone to try and convince them to seek redemption. These meetings always leave the powerful fiends awed by how effortlessly he defeats them, but they inevitably return to their evil ways. Most harbor resentment from the encounter and eagerly await his return for a chance at vengeance.

## The Spiral of Korada

> The **Spiral of Korada** is a holy symbol of the empyreal lord: it consists of a spiral rotating clockwise from its centre. On the spiral are balanced three circles representing thoughts on the past, concentration about the present and consideration of the future. The symbol is prevalent in Koradan temples where it must never be obscured.
