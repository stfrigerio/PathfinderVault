> The obscure [[Deity|god]] **Camazotz** appears as an enormous and terrifying man-like [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bat]] that takes delight in hunting [[Mortal|mortals]] during the darkness. An ancient and obscure deity, Camazotz shows little real interest in the affairs of his mortal followers except to receive offerings and sacrifices. He expects fanaticism from his followers, and perceives failure as weakness.



## History

> Camazotz's priests originally had a strong presence in the [[Land of Black Blood]] in [[Orv]], but were expelled by followers of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Abraxas]]. The dead [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Vyriavaxus]] may have been one of his spawn.


## Realm

> Camazotz dwells in three different places in both [[Golarion]] and the [[Great Beyond]]. The first is the [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Argahoz]], a cavernous realm dominated by an enormous pit. The second is the Land of the Eleven Deaths, a [[Darklands]] realm beneath the distant continent of [[Arcadia]]; while the third is the House of the Bat in the realm of death, [[Xibalba]].


## Sacred animals

> Though he favors bats most of all, Camazotz has a fondness for all nocturnal predators, including [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spiders]], vultures and [[Wolf|wolves]].


## Cults of Camazotz

> Mortal worshipers of Camazotz strive to subvert the trappings and comforts of civilization and spread fear. Ceremonies to the Hungry Dark always involve blood sacrifices, preferably drawn by the fangs of living creatures, which are fed to statues of Camazotz.
