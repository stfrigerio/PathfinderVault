## Lost Mines of Nirmathas

> Around [[4717 AR]], followers of Benorus were sought by investigators into the disappearance of the [[Lost Mines]] of [[Nirmathas]]. The investigators hoped that Benorus himself could be asked to intervene in finding the mines and the workers that were lost, as other [[Magic/Divination|divination]] magic had failed.
