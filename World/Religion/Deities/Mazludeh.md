> **Mazludeh** was an [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] worshiped by the residents of Udo (an ancient city-state) responsible for organizing the Celestial Concordance which established the [[Celestial|celestial]] sponsorship of the nation of [[Holomog]] to protect millions from the [[Chaos|chaos]] of the [[Age of Darkness]]. She is now their matron [[God|goddess]].



## History

> Before [[Starfall]], Mazludeh was the empyreal lord of stewardship and loving sacrifice. Her [[Serpent|serpentine]] aspect has led some to speculate that she predates [[Humanity|humanity]] and may have been worshiped by [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]] or [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] before the rise of [[Azlant]].
> After the creation of Holomog, she became the primary goddess in that nation, representing balance, community, negotiation, and twilight.


## Appearance and emissaries

> Mazludeh is depicted as an enormous serpent with a shaggy mane full of figs or eggs. She is also sometimes shown as a [[Medusa|medusa-like]] woman with serpents for hair.
> Her approval is shown through fresh eggs on a pillow or small, non-venomous snakes that devour pests.


## Church of Mazludeh

> Her church is ubiquitous within Holomog. As the primary sponsor of the Celestial Concordance, she is seen as the matron of their nation, as well as a diplomat to the other empyreal lords which bless Holomog with its prosperity, and enforce the principles of its governance.
> Clergy of Mazludeh serve as city planners, architects, archivists, [[Engineering|engineers]], and farmers within Holomog society. Community and duty are the highest values within the church.


### Temples and shrines

> In [[Anuli]], the Tower of the Ninety-Four contains a shrine to Mazludeh and the 93 empyreal lords recognized by Holomog. Enormous libraries within the tower contain holy texts dating back to before Starfall and hundreds of clergy operate from within it.
