> One of the infamous [[Queens of the Night]], **Eiseth** laughs at any devil who claims she has ascended as far as a female [[Devil|devil]] can in [[Hell]]'s hierarchy. She bears an extreme hatred of the [[Celestial|celestial]] realms, and often leads raiding parties into [[Elysium]], [[Nirvana]], and even [[Heaven]] itself. Her [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a dark-winged snake, or a horned longbow.



## History

> Eiseth was once a [[Movanic deva|movanic deva]] serving a long-dead [[Good|good]] [[Deity|deity]]. She found herself perpetually frustrated and held back by the incompetence of her [[Empyrean|empyrean]] superior and her less dedicated comrades, and ached to become an [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] of duty and vengeance so she could command the legions as she wanted. Eiseth became convinced that when her superior fell, she would grow in power and succeed her.
> When her commander made a decision she considered especially foolish, Eiseth murdered her and her most trusted advisors. Before a tribunal of [[Solar|solars]], she plainly stated that she had made the right decision for the greater good. In return, the horrified jury demanded a terrible sentence. Eiseth never grasped the full details of her punishment, as she fled [[Heaven]] as soon as she sensed them turning against her.
> For 603 years, Eiseth wandered the [[Great Beyond]], unsure why the greater good in her [[Evil|evil]] deed was not taken into account, while hatred for her former peers grew and burnt a hole in her heart. Eventually, in a dream, Eiseth saw a vision of herself, her wings black, her robes stained with [[Celestial|celestial]] blood, her [[Gold|golden]] [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] a pure ebony, presiding over a realm of tortured [[Soul|souls]] nestled into a strange mountain of [[Iron|iron]] and brass blades. Eiseth dedicated herself to searching for this mountain, eventually finding it in [[Dis]], second layer of Hell, whose lord [[Dispater]] welcomed her.
> The *[[Chronicle of the Righteous]]* instead claims that Eiseth was once an [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] who embodied righteous wrath, much like [[Ragathiel]].


## Home

> Eiseth trains [[Erinys|erinyes]] and forges [[Munagola|munagolas]] in a foul palace covered in brass and iron blades from which hang the impaled bodies of history's greatest chauvinists. Only those who live there know that its true name is Valkyria Reforged; others have taken to call it *Widow's Cry*, after the screams that echo from it. Although some claim that they are uttered by wronged mothers and maidens, or damned souls being transformed into [[Devil|devils]], they are in truth the cries of victory as souls break free of their limitations. Despite being located within Hell's largest metropolis, the Infernal City of Dis, Eiseth's aerie functions more like an independent polity.


## Appearance

> Much like her daughters, the erinyes, she maintains the appearance of a [[Angel|angelic]] being, with beautiful features and black, feathered wings. Eiseth's beauty is the exact opposite of her (former) angelic brethren: as terrifying and intimidating as an angel's face is calm and comforting.


## Relationships

> When [[Mortality|mortals]] began to associate her with [[Ardad Lili]] and call them 'whore queens' due to their gender and shared home in Hell, Eiseth travelled to the [[Stainless Caress]] to meet with Ardad Lili and was impressed by her cunning and focused hatred of Nirvana. She then reached out to [[Doloras]] and [[Mahathallah]] and, finding that they have no conflict of interest, the four began calling themselves the Queens of the Night and formed an alliance, finding that their strength is greater together in the crucible of Hell.
> Although her fortress is located within Dis, Eiseth operates outside of Dispater's rules and openly defies him when she sees fit.
> According to the *Chronicles of the Righteous*, Eiseth might have some relation to Ragathiel.
> The [[Infernal duke|infernal duke]] [[Lorthact]] recently served Eiseth as a consort until she uncovered a plot in which he would overthrow and replace her. Enraged, she sent her erinyes to track him down despite his claims of innocence. Thus far the cunning devil has eluded capture, but the Erinyes Queen's wrath is eternal and the hunt continues unabated.
> Eiseth plans to invade [[Malebolge]] and overthrow [[Moloch]] as the General of Hell. Once she has defeated him, Eiseth intends to marshal Hell's entire army and defeat Heaven for good.
