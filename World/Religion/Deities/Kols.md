> **Kols**, known to his faithful as the Oath-Keeper (or Oathkeeper), is the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[Demigod|demigod]] of duty. His personal duties are following and serving his father [[Torag]] and protecting his brother [[Grundinnar]], and sister [[Bolka]]. He is also the deity tasked with exacting punishment on those poor [[Soul|souls]] who shirk their responsibilities or break sworn oaths and solemn promises.  Some believe that [[Dranngvit]], the dwarven [[Deity|goddess]] of vengeance, is Kols' true mother.
