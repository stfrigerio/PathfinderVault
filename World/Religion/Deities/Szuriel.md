![[Apollyon_image_1.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 The [[Four Horsemen]] ride out with Szuriel top right.

> **Szuriel** (pronounced ZUR-ee-el) is the [[Four Horsemen|Horseman of War]]: a deadly and destructive [[Archdaemon|archdaemon]] from [[Abaddon]]. She appears as a black-winged woman with bleeding eyes and ragged teeth, served by her [[Deacon|deacons]], the [[Purrodaemon|purrodaemons]] from her citadel, the [[Cinder Furnace]].



## History

> Szuriel was once a [[Mortality|mortal]] [[Paladin|paladin]]. No one remembers why she was excommunicated from her faith, but she regardless gathered an army of bloodthirsty soldiers to conquer her homeland, declaring herself empress, and putting all members of her former religion to the [[Sword|sword]]. As she prepared to invade neighbouring nations, they sent assassins to kill her; one was successful, and Szuriel was sent to Abaddon.
> As a [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioner]], Szuriel avoided the [[Daemon|daemons]] long enough to be transformed into a daemon herself. She rallied other daemons under her, killing and taking the power of progressively more powerful daemons. Shortly after [[Lamashtu|Lamashtus]] invasion of Abaddon, which resulted in the destruction of the then-Horseman of War Roshmolem and his replacement by Ortaro, Szuriel acted. She led her armies to the [[Cinder Furnace]] and ended Ortaro's brief reign, succeeding him as Horseman of War.


## Appearance

> Szuriel resembles a 20-foot tall [[Angel|angel]] with flowing blonde hair, ivory skin, black wings, jagged razor-sharp teeth and onyx-black mirrored eyes constantly dripping blood.


## Relationships

> Szuriel is allied with the other three Horsemen, but disagrees with them on how to destroy mortal life. She counts at least two daemonic [[Harbinger|harbingers]] as her servants: [[Geon]], who trains and commands her cavalry; and [[Zelishkar]], whom she originally created. Lamashtu holds a grudge against Szuriel for having turned away her invasion of Abaddon; and [[Asmodeus]], who wishes to corrupt and claim [[Soul|souls]], is opposed to her destructive consumption of them. Szuriel seemingly randomly receives missives from [[Archdevil]] [[Moloch]] for unknown reasons; she is one of the very few non-[[Devil|devils]] that have set foot inside his Melqart Keep.
> [[Gorum]] views Szuriel as a rival: he is sometimes allied with her and sometimes her enemy, but takes all conflicts against her personally. Gorum supports battle and wants mortals to embrace the glory of war, while Szuriel wants them to accept oblivion, and this outlook can draw away Gorum's worshippers. The divine realms of [[Urgathoa]] and [[Zyphus]] lie within Szuriel's territory; she does not communicate with them, and her daemons do not fight them, but sometimes trade information with their servants.


## Cults

> Szuriel is worshipped by those that profit or earn glory from war, especially where the war has lasted so long that both sides have forgotten the reason why they fight. Her clergy consists of predominantly [[Cleric|clerics]], [[Inquisitor|inquisitors]], [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]], and [[Souldrinker|souldrinkers]]; and to a lesser extent, [[Oracle|oracles]], [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Antipaladin|antipaladins]], and [[Magus|magi]]. They usually keep the identity of their patron secret, and welcome new initiates with hidden rites. Due to Szuriel's hatred of procreation, her followers are expected to sacrifice their spouses and children to prove their loyalty to her, and execute non-combatants and surrendered foes.


### Unholy symbol

> Szuriel's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a pale hand holding a black sword upright. She carries the sword *[[Lamentation of the Faithless]]*, which has been borne by all Horsemen of War.


## Faith on Golarion

> The Horseman of War is worshipped in [[Magnimar]].


> [[Paizo]] published a major article about Szuriel in *[[Rasputin Must Die]]*.
