> **Ayrzul**, the **Fossilized King**, is one of the four powerful [[Demigod|demigods]] collectively known as the [[Elemental lord|elemental lords]], who dwells on the [[Plane of Earth]].



## History

> Ayrzul has existed since the earliest days of the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]], during which he shared control of the Plane of Earth with his rival [[Sairazul]], one of four [[Good|good]] elemental lords. Initially, the good elemental lords had the upper hand, while their [[Evil|evil]] rivals were disorganised. However, as life evolved on the [[Material Plane]] and started using the [[Element|elements]] for evil purposes, the situation reversed. While the good elemental lords started bickering, Ayrzul and fellow evil elemental lords [[Ymeri]] and [[Hshurha]] were gathered under one banner by [[Kelizandri]], and together they defeated their good rivals one by one and sealed them away.
> Shortly after he defeated Sairazul, Ayrzul encountered the [[Xiomorn|xiomorns]], who were originally created by his rival but had forgotten about her. He craved the mythic essence that Sairazul imbued into the xiomorns, and showed them a vision of their race going extinct during a mental invasion of the [[Yithian|yithians]]. He then asked them to sacrifice a quarter of their number so he could have the power to teach the rest how to forestall their demise. The xiomorns, appalled by this suggestion, nonetheless believed Ayrzul and decided to sacrifice the mythic essence of half their number instead, granting Ayrzul the same influx of primordial power. In exchange for their essence, Ayrzul gave the xiomorns knowledge of the *Vault Seeds*.
> Because of Ayrzul's reclusive nature, he is sometimes mistakenly believed to be a powerful [[Earth elemental|earth elemental]], a [[Shaitan|shaitan]] [[Wizard|wizard]], an [[Undead|undead]] [[Crystal dragon|crystal dragon]], or even a fragment of the dead [[Deity|god]] [[Ydersius]].


## Home

> Ayrzul rules the realm known as the [[Blistering Labyrinth]] on the Plane of Earth. He has never been seen outside his realm, giving rise to speculation that he is somehow bound to the region.
> Ayrzul shows little interest in the politics of the Plane of Earth; he is seemingly content with maintaining the status quo. Instead, he concentrates his efforts against the [[Plane of Fire]] and his hated rival, Ymeri, the Queen of the Inferno.


## Cults

> Ayrzul considers the xiomorns to be his favoured children, and they in turn see him as their patron, if not their god.
