> **Sairazul**, [[Elemental lord|elemental lord]] of caves, earth, and gems, is trapped and isolated in a [[Gem|gemstone]] prison called the *[[Moaning Diamond]]*. She created many [[Outsider|outsiders]], including [[Agrawgh|agrawghs]] and [[Xiomorn|xiomorns]], but has been cut off from her children and worshipers. Her consorts still search the [[Plane|planes]] for her prison and hope to free and return her to the [[Plane of Earth]].



## History

> In the [[Age of Creation]], when [[Mortality|mortals]] began to use the elements for [[Evil|evil]], the [[Good|good]] elemental lords began to squabble, [[Ranginori]] blaming Sairazul for [[Weapon|weapons]] made of [[Metal|metal]]. This allowed the evil elemental lords to unite and work together to imprison them. In the aftermath of Sairazul's fall, her rival [[Ayrzul]] stole the secret knowledge of the *Vault Seeds* from her and imparted them to the xiomorns, who no longer remember that she was their creator.


## Appearance and emissaries

> Sairazul looks like a termite queen carved from a perfect, luminescent, polychromatic gem.


## Church of Sairazul


### Worshipers and clergy

> While Sairazul has long been unable to provide [[Divine magic|divine magic]], some of her children on the Plane of Earth remain loyal to her, and she is also revered by mortals who exalt creation and reproduction.
