*This article details the [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp usher]]; for the village chief of [[Novoboro]], see [[Saloc human]].*
> **Saloc** is a genderless [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp usher]] who revels in the free will of [[Mortality|the living]] to do almost anything. Saloc defends [[Soul|souls]] on trial, arguing that they should be judged on the basis of both intentions and consequences. Saloc sometimes resurrects souls whom they deem to have been unfairly judged. The Minder of Immortals also judges [[Deity|deities]], in the rare cases that is necessary.



## Home

> Saloc dwells in a crypt-temple called the Tumulus, a site destined to be a comforting cradle for [[Immortal|immortals]] when they die at the end of time. Saloc spends their time studying the growth of timeless beings and the moral structure of the cosmos. The city of [[Spire's Edge|Spires Edge]] is constructed around the Tumulus, and Saloc governs it through a tribune of [[Yamaraj|yamaraj]] [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]] on leave from their court rooms. Pinnacle Hall serves as Saloc's palace and hall of governance, as well as the residence of the ruling yamaraj. The intransigent [[Nosoi|nosoi]] Aqui serves as Saloc's advisor and directs the palace's nosoi and [[Viduus|viduus]] bureaucrats.


## Appearance

> Saloc is roughly [[Humanoid|humanoid]], with a featureless face and [[Stag|stag]] horns orbited by two eye-lined [[Gold|golden]] rings.


## Relationships

> Saloc is held in low regard by most of their colleagues, due to their tendency to resurrect [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] and undo judgements. [[Vale]] especially hates them, viewing Saloc as immature for doing so.
