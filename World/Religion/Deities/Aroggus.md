> **Aroggus** is the [[Velstrac demagogue|velstrac demagogue]] of possibility, revenge, and sanctuary.



## History


 A supplicant prostrates before the velstrac demagogue Aroggus.
> Aroggus is the oldest and greatest velstrac demagogue, and originated in [[Hell]], before [[Asmodeus]] and the [[Devil|devils]] came there. Following [[Geryon|Geryons]] devouring of 812 former tyrants of [[Hell]], the velstracs were bound in chains until freed by [[Doloras]]. Aroggus led the [[Velstrac|velstracs]] in their exodus out of Hell into the darkness of the [[Shadow Plane]], near the numerous prey of the [[Material Plane]], where deep shadows are abundant for the velstracs to craft into sanctuaries and fortifications. There he raised the [[Abbey of Nevers]], where the velstracs could hide forever if necessary. Since then, Aroggus and his followers have resided in the Abbey, indulging in delusions of retribution and perfecting the one true revenge.


## Appearance

> After he established the Abbey of Nevers, Aroggus shed his physical body, leaving nothing but smoke and shadow; his essence has essentially merged with the Abbey of Nevers. Whenever he needs to leave his realm, he inhabits a massive black suit of [[Armour|armour]] and wields the [[Warhammer|warhammer]] that he carried out of Hell.


## Relationships

> Aroggus spends his time devising and simulating the perfect way to take revenge against Geryon and the devils that displaced his people out of Hell.


## Cults

> Aroggus is worshipped by those consumed by revenge. Cults of Aroggus never last, as they bicker constantly and can go to bloodshed over perceived insults.
