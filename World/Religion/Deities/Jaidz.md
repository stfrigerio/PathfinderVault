> **Jaidz** is a powerful [[Agathion|agathion]] [[Empyreal lord]] who seeks to inspire courage in the cowardly and immature through compassion and guidance.



## Appearance

> The Empyreal lord's natural form is a giant black [[Tiger|tiger]] with white spots, but he appears to mortals as a dark-skinned man with white-streaked black hair, golden cat's eyes and claws, and a long white-tipped black tail.


## Church of the Fearless Claw

> Following Jaidz's teachings of helping the anxious and cowardly overcome their fears, his worshipers often test the courage and potential of people seeking his aid. Jaidz also attracts young mortals wary of the challenges of adulthood.
> A worshiper of Jaidz demonstrates obedience by using chalk to mark channels of meditative energy on her body, then gently tracing those lines with a tiger's fang. Among his devout followers, Jaidz can inspire divine acts of heroism, and strike terror into their foes.


## Realm

> Jaidz resides in the topmost tier of one of the Dragonmane Mountains of [[Nirvana]]. His wooden pavilion is draped with curtains of green, magenta, and indigo.
