>  **Iomedae** (pronounced ahy-OH-meh-day) is the [[goddess]] of righteous valor, justice, and honor. Having served as [[Aroden's]] herald, she inherited many of the [[Last Azlanti's]] followers upon his death, and continues to espouse the ideas of honor and righteousness in the defense of [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good]] and the battle against [[Evil]].



## History

![[Parnoneryx_and_Iomedae.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Iomedae fights alongside the [[Gold dragon]] [[Parnoneryx]] before her [[Ascension]].
>  As a mortal, Iomedae was a [[Chelaxian]] [[Human]] born in [[Cheliax]] around 3800 AR. After joining the [[Shining Crusade]] in about [[3816 AR]], she ascended to lead the [[Knights of Ozem]] in the struggle against the forces of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]]. Years of struggle brought about many great feats, including the creation of the [[Artifact]] *[[Heart's Edge]]* in [[3826 AR]] from the pieces of Iomedae's [[sword]] that had been broken by the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]], an action immortalized as [[Iomedae's Sixth Act]]. Also in this time, in [[3831 AR]], Iomedae completed her [[Tenth Act]] after ruling [[Kantaria]] for a year and a day and battling [[faceless stalkers]] under the control of [[veiled masters]].
>  In the fall of [[3832 AR]], she became the most recent person to pass the [[Test of the Starstone]] and acquire a spark of divinity. Her actions caught the notice of Aroden, who chose her as his [[Herald]], replacing the slain [[Arazni]]. Iomedae served him in this capacity until Aroden's death in [[4606 AR]], after which she took over many of his followers and legacy, and became known as the **Inheritor**. Aroden was inspired by Iomedae's devotion, optimism, tenacity in the fight against evil and, especially, her goodness which was a foil to his own dark thoughts that grew as the millennia passed by.


## Relationships

>  Iomedae views [[Abadar]], [[Cayden Cailean]], [[Erastil]], [[Sarenrae]], [[Shelyn]], and [[Torag]] as allies. She harbours a grudge against [[Pharasma]] for keeping the truth behind Aroden's death a secret. There is also a slight rivalry between Iomedae and [[Irori]] and their respective followers. Irori's worshipers, believing that anyone can achieve divinity through rigorous discipline and self-improvement, consider achieving godhood via a magical artifact as cheating. With the exception of [[Asmodeus]], Iomedae never associates or parleys with evil gods or [[fiends]]. She treats the Lord of [[Hell]] with extreme caution, and never in more than an advisory role.


## Appearance

![[Iomedae.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 An artist's rendition of Iomedae.
>  Iomedae manifests as a valiant sword-mistress in full [[plate mail]], wielding a [[longsword]] and a heraldic [[shield]]. Her shield casts a holy light, blinding evil beings, and her aura causes malevolent forces to tremble and falter.


## Realm

>  Unlike Aroden's realm on [[Axis]], [[Iomedae's Realm]] is located on [[Proelera]], [[Heaven's]] second tier. Even though she is a young [[Deity]], she has been judged of great importance to Heaven, a fact reflected in the expansiveness of her realm. It is a peaceful land of small keeps that somewhat resembles the previous realm of Aroden, and is a significant source of support for Heaven's [[Archon]] armies.


## Providence

>  Iomedae makes her favor known by reshaping ordinary objects into sword-like shapes, the appearance of gold or white light around a person or object, or the magnet-like pull of a longsword or other long metal [[weapon]] in a particular direction. Her anger is displayed through flickering lights, the breaking of weapons against formerly yielding material, and the tarnishing and increased weight of [[gold]] or [[silver]].


## Servants

>  Iomedae's [[Divine servitor]] race are the [[angels]] known as [[iophanites]]. These flying, metal wheels resemble [[harbingers]] or [[lantern archons]] and aid the goddess and her forces in battle as messengers.


### Unique servants

>  Iomedae's servants include a number of former mortals who have been given divine power following death.

[[Galfrey]]
**Queen Galfrey** is the former absolute monarch of the crusader-state of [[Mendev]], and leader of the [[Mendevian Crusades]]. She abdicated her rule in [[4718 AR]] at the end of the [[Fifth Mendevian Crusade]] and was chosen to be the new [[Herald]] of Iomedae.
[[Hand of the Inheritor]]
The former herald of Iomedae appeared as a golden-skinned [[Angel]] who embraced honorable combat, the encouragement of just rulers, and the promotion of valorous deeds.. He was captured and tortured by the [[Demon lord]] Baphomet during the Fifth Mendevian Crusade. After the end of the war, Iomedae replaced him with the mortal [[Crusader Queen Galfrey]] of Mendev.
[[Jingh]]
This servant of Iomedae manifests as a wheel of bright white metal illuminated by holy fire.
[[Peace through Vigilance]]
This servant is a young but cheerful and spirited [[Celestial]] [[Gold dragon]].
[[Saint Lymirin]]
This former priestess of Iomedae sometimes appears as an [[eagle-headed]] winged [[Humanoid]].

## Church of Iomedae

![[Iomedae_ascendant.jpg|right+hmed]]

>  The Church of Iomedae is assertive and vigilant in rooting out evil. Many of its followers are actively involved in the [[Mendevian Crusades]]. In fact, the threat of the [[Worldwound]] gave the church a purpose—finish the task [[Aroden]] started years ago and finally defeat [[Deskari]], the [[Demon lord]] believed to be behind the opening of the portal to the [[Abyss]]. The church founded the [[First Mendevian Crusade]] in [[4622 AR]] as a way to lessen the loss of [[Aroden]], becoming zealots. Besides [[Mendev]], Iomedae's faithful are also found in greater numbers in [[Absalom]], [[Andoran]], [[Cheliax]], [[Galt]], [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], [[Molthune]], [[Nirmathas]], [[Numeria]], and [[Vidrian]], and among [[Chelaxians]], [[Taldans]], and [[halflings]] throughout the [[Inner Sea region]].
>  Having inherited many of Aroden's faithful, Iomedae and her priests continue to promote his teachings, although they tend to be more progressive in their thinking than he ever was, and feel themselves less inhibited by the events of history.


### Worshipers

![[Lastwall_soldiers.jpg]]

>  Personal cleanliness as well as an honorable demeanor are both very important for her followers, who are known for their sense of justice, swordcraft, statesmanship, and their desire to bring "civilization" to those "without it". [[Adventurers]] who honor Iomedae sometimes wear a narrow white, red, yellow, or gold chasuble.
>  Many [[halflings]] are treated unjustly on Golarion, or are kept as [[slaves]]. Nevertheless, some of these oppressed halflings believe in justice and often worship Iomedae, and most halfling [[paladins]] serve the Inheritor.
>  Young [[knights]] who are inspired by classical, courtly tales tend to follow Iomedae. They can be counted on to remain idealistic, even in the face of great evil. Their honor and faith are strong enough to overcome the vices and sins of their enemies. Iomedae's [[paladins]] are also among the most prominent and well-represented in the Inner Sea region.


#### Obedience

>  Certain dedicated worshipers of Iomedae perform daily [[obediences]] in order to receive a [[divine]] blessing known as a [[boons]] from their god. Iomedae's obedience takes the form of a ritual in which the worshiper holds his primary weapon in front of him with the goddess' [[holy symbol]] attached. He then prays for guidance and protection from the Inheritor, while promising to follow her teachings. When performed correctly, the ceremony is said to instill preternatural skills in diplomacy and knowledge of all things pertaining to the noble classes.


### Clergy

>  Her priests are composed of [[clerics]] and paladins, who perform an hour of prayer a day, in addition to a weekly public worship service. Their formal raiment includes a white cassock with gold or yellow trim and mitre, while on non-festival days they dress in similarly colored, if less ostentatious, clothing.


### Temples and shrines

>  The temples of Iomedae function as both a church and living space for her holy knights. Former temples of Aroden are frequently converted into honoring the Inheritor. Temples are often painted white and feature arched entrances, pillared courtyards, fountains, and statues.


### Holy texts

![[Keren_GOF.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Keren Rhinn]], [[paladin]] of Iomedae and [[Knight of Ozem]].
***Main article: [[Acts of Iomedae]]***
>  Her holy text is called the *[[Acts of Iomedae]]*, or more often just the *The Acts*, and recounts the 11 miracles she performed during her mortal life.


### Holy sites

>  One of Iomedae's best known and most important temples is the [[Seventh Church]] in Absalom, site of her seventh miracle (*see Acts of Iomedae above*).


### Holidays

>  The 6th of [[Lamashan]] is [[Ascendance Day]], commemorating the day Iomedae took the Test of the Starstone and achieved godhood. [[Inheritor's Ascendance]] is celebrated on the first of [[Arodus]] every year to mark the day when the goddess became the herald of Aroden. On the 19th of [[Rova]] is the [[Day of the Inheritor]], which marks the entrance of Aroden's faithful into the church of Iomedae. Iomedae's Church has a number of other festivals including First Crusader Day on 6th Arodus, [[Armasse]] on 16th Arodus, and Remembrance Moon on the day of the full moon in [[Desnus]].


### Favored animals

>  Gods are often associated with certain [[Animals]], either because they possess a quality favored by the god, or because the god's faithful feel a special kinship to them. Iomedae's favored animals include [[lions]], [[eagles]] and other symbols of leadership, and [[migratory birds]].


## Organizations

>  The most famous of the military orders devoted to spreading Iomedae's word is the Knights of Ozem, in whose ranks Iomedae herself served when she was mortal.
>  The [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Godclaw]] worships an aspect of Iomedae, although they are not part of the church.
