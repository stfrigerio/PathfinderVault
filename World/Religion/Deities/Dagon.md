>  **Dagon** (pronounced DAY-gon) is the [[Demon lord]] of the sea and sea monsters that dwell in its darkest depths.



## Dogma

>  Like other demon lords, Dagon is able to grant [[spells]] and other powers to his worshipers. He encourages them to swim underwater, increase their own strength, and propogate the spread of dangerous sea monsters. He considers the breaking of oaths as a sin against him, forbids his followers to settle in land-locked areas and share any secrets with those outside of his cult.


## History

>  One of the oldest beings of the [[Abyss]], Dagon predates the advent of [[mortal life]] and [[demons]] and began life as a [[Qlippoth lord]]. In those days he was a ravenous, nameless, mindless sea monster that ate everything that crossed his path. After having consumed countless demons and [[larvae]], Dagon became intelligent and infused himself with mortal sin, becoming a demon.
>  Dagon is said to have slain the great [[Kraken]] [[Kaktora]], thereby creating the [[Devilfish]] now haunting [[Golarion's]] oceans.


## Home

>  Dagon dwells in the depths of the [[Abyssal Language]] sea of [[Ishiar]], in [[Ugothanok]], a sunken city with architecture so ancient as to be almost alien.


## Appearance

>  Dagon's appearance is hideously monstrous and somewhat alien, being neither fully [[Fish]], [[Eel]], nor [[Octopus]]; he is some foul amalgamation of all three. He has the lower body of an eel, a horrific face, and four tentacles in place of arms. Dagon is one of the largest demon lords, measuring 35 feet in length. His spawn often take after him, being similarly disgusting combinations of deep sea creatures.


## Relationships

>  Dagon revels in the intelligence he earned by becoming a demon, and does not want to return to his origin as a mindless qlippoth lord. He bears the [[Qlippoth]] no ill will but does not allow them within his realm.


## Church of Dagon


### Worshipers

>  Dagon is quite active on the [[Material Plane]], regularly sending his [[demonic]] minions to the deep oceans of the world to become high priests for [[Evil]] aquatic monster races, such as the [[gutaki]]. He is even worshiped by some of the more savage [[Sahuagin]] tribes. 
>  Unfortunately, Dagon's foul influence is not limited to the ocean depths; he is also revered by some debased coastline societies, who often maintain a façade of worshipping another [[Deity]]. In these twisted communities, land dwellers mix with ichthyic beings from the depths, spawning horrible cross-breeds which have no place in the natural order of things. [[Marsh giants]] are normally the most fervent of Dagon's land-based followers, but his cult has been growing amongst [[humans]] in isolated villages, who secretly turn to his worship, sometimes on the promise of bountiful fishing or alien [[golden]] jewellery. Some sailors also worship Dagon, luring [[ships]] to collide with rocky shores and performing blood sacrifices to call forth sea monsters.
>  The surface of the Abyssal Realm of [[Ishiar]] is inhabited by [[fiendish]] and [[Half-fiend]] [[humans]] known as Ishians, who seek to impress Dagon by constantly fighting each other and by claiming new islands in his name.
>  Some of Dagon's followers (particularly [[deep ones]]) also worship the [[Great Old Ones]], most often [[Cthulhu]], mixing the traditions of both into a single blasphemous religion. Some elder deep ones take his name for themselves, which Dagon sees as a compliment.


### Temples &amp; shrines

>  Dagon is usually worshipped in decaying churches, caves, or lighthouses located near the sea, or in dark underwater cathedrals.


### Unholy symbol

>  Dagon's [[unholy symbol]] is an octopus eye surrounded by a gold disk inscribed with ancient looking runes.
