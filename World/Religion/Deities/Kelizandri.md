> **Kelizandri** is said to be the semi-divine offspring of a [[Brine dragon|brine dragon]] and a minor [[Demigod|demigod]], and is one of the four powerful beings collectively known as the [[Elemental lord|elemental lords]]. He rules over his realm of [[Kelizandrika]], located on the [[Plane of Water|Elemental Plane of Water]] where it borders the dark [[Plane of Earth]]. He generally takes the form of an immense dragon-like creature made of earth, metal, and crystal, and vacillates between periods of intense, violent activity and apparent torpor.



## History

> Kelizandri has existed since the earliest days of the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]], during which he shared control of the Plane of Water with his rival [[Lysianassa]], one of four [[Good|good]] elemental lords. Initially, Lysianassa and her three allies had the upper hand, while their evil rivals were disorganised. However, as life evolved on the [[Material Plane]] and started using the elements for evil purposes, the situation reversed. While the good elemental lords started bickering, Kelizandri gathered his fellow evil elemental lords [[Ayrzul]], [[Hshurha]], and [[Ymeri]], and together they defeated their good rivals one by one and sealed them away.
> Kelizandri is said to have destroyed the last [[Marid|marid]] Saline Padishah Niloufar the Great, and destroyed her capital city Arzanib, during the early years of the [[Age of Darkness]]. Since that time the native [[Genie|genie]] race has been fractured and without a strong leader.


## Home

> Kelizandri is said to reside in his Palace of Salt and Bones, within the ruins of an ancient marid city made of coral that he dragged into the depths of Kelizandrika thousands of years ago. He frequently roams the waters around his palace to feast on [[Kraken|krakens]] or fight brine dragons he considers to be disrespectful. The palace is known for its opulence as the wealthiest location on the plane, as well as for its warped pale servants that resemble [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]].


## Relations with others

> His realm is adjacent to the divided kingdoms of the sahuagin and he is in frequent conflict with them. His presence is one of the only things that is able to unite the otherwise fractured Sea Devils behind a common goal.

## Worshipers

> Kelizandri is not a frequent object of veneration on the [[Material Plane]], but is occasionally worshiped by coastal communities who make their living from the ocean. One of these is the seaside city of Shogokabe in the nation of [[Minkai]].


## Legends

> Though no direct evidence exists, many inhabitants of the Plane of Water believe that the poisonous, red-coloured algae that drifts on the tides within the plane called the Carmine Scourge blooms at locations through which Kelizandri has passed.
