> **Zagresh the Destroyer** is said to be the eldest [[Orc|orc]] [[Demigod|demigod]], who represents their primal nature before they learnt the ways of [[Technology|technology]] and [[Magic|magic]]. A nihilist, Zagresh desires no glory nor power, fights only to survive, and lives only to destroy. Orcs who follow him not only kill their enemies, but reduce everything they have built to dust.



## Appearance

> Zagresh is depicted as a savage orc with huge tusks, clad in the hide of large [[Animal|animals]] and wielding a greatclub. He rarely speaks, preferring to show his emotions through animalistic sounds. His roar echoes across the battlefield, terrifying enemies.


## Relationships

> Zagresh is usually directed by other orc [[Deity|gods]] against those whom they seek to destroy, and Zagresh does not care for their intrigue as long as there are enemies for him to slaughter.


## Cults

> Zagresh is especially popular among subterranean and savage orcs, who have little material wealth and revel in destroying others' creations, sometimes even their own as well. Even civilised orcs revere him as the god of violent death, to which they all aspire. [[Necromancy|Necromancers]] pay homage to him as god of [[Undead|undead]], while others pray to him so the dead will not come back.
