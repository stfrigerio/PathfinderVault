> **Hellion** is an [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] revered as a [[Deity|god]] for providing [[Divine magic|divine powers]] to its followers, the [[Lords of Rust]].



## History

> Centuries ago, the [[Iron God]] [[Unity]] downloaded some of its code into an empty processor, mounted it into an [[Arachnid robot|arachnid robot]], and tested it by sending it out from the [[Silver Mount]]. Once outside, this new artificial intelligence gained sentience and fled to central [[Numeria]]. The [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spider-like]] [[Robot|robot]] set up a hidden lair in [[Scrapwall]] in [[4'5 AR]].
> In the years since, the new artificial intelligence developed the unstable, irrational persona of Hellion and drew worshipers in [[Scrapwall]] seeking its power.


## Appearance

![[Arachnid_robot.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 An [[Arachnid robot|arachnid robot]] chassis similar to the one used by Hellion.
> Hellion most frequently appears in video monitors and holograms in a [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] form but has little knowledge about, much less affiliation with, the [[Lower plane|lower planes]]. It also inhabits a specially modified arachnid robot when necessary.


## Worship

> Hellion rules its congregation largely through fear, intimidation, and the lure of divine power. The Lords of Rust serve as its clergy, and it uses them to recruit or subjugate new followers.


### Servants

> Hellion counts a number of faithful servants among his cowed followers, including:

> - [[Kulgara]]
> - [[Meyanda]]
