> **Atropos** is a [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp usher]] who determines when each [[Mortality|mortal]] will die and judges the most difficult of [[Soul|souls]]: those of dead children. As the **Judge of Judges**, only [[Pharasma]] has greater powers of arbitration over the fate of mortal [[Soul|souls]] than Atropos. She is the youngest daughter of Pharasma, called the **Last Sister** (though few know of her older sisters), and rumoured to be Pharasma's chosen successor in the next incarnation of reality.



## Home

> Atropos lives with her mother in [[Pharasma's Palace|Pharasmas Palace]] and shares her realm there; she also holds control over the courts and [[Portal|portals]] in the [[Boneyard]].


## Appearance

> Atropos is a [[Wolf|wolf]]-sized [[Nosoi|nosoi]] wearing a [[Silver|silver]] mask, with a long [[Peacock|peacock]] tail with an eye for every soul she will ever judge. In her mother's court, she sometimes appears as a young [[Human|human]] girl.
