> **Zevgavizeb** (pronounced zev-GAV-ah-zeb) is a bestial [[Demon lord|demon lord]] worshipped by the [[Xulgath|xulgaths]] of [[Golarion]]. His [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is a set of twisted tentacles that end in vicious talons.



## History

> In the primordial days of the [[Great Beyond]], the [[Qlippoth lord|qlippoth lord]] Zevgavizeb ruled over a dark corner of the [[Abyss]]. When the [[Demon|demons]] displaced the [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] from the upper layers of the Abyss, a group of [[Protean|proteans]] known as the Wyrms of Paradox transformed a few qlippoth, including Zevgavizeb, into demons to weaken the Abyss, distracting both races from the [[Maelstrom]] and allowing reality to spring from it.
> Whether his qlippoth origin is the reason behind Zevgavizeb's seeming disinterest in the rest of the [[Great Beyond]], like foul [[Dagon]], is open to speculation.


## Home

> Zevgavizeb makes his home in Zevgessos, the central and largest of the [[Planet|planet]]-sized cavern worlds that make up the [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Gluttondark]]. He encourages the [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] xulgaths and monsters who live in these caverns to wage war against each other, culling the weak and cowardly, and ensuring that his minions are as powerful as possible. Instead of a miniature [[Star|star]] like other caverns, the core of Zevgavizeb's personal demesne is the Verdant Moon, where he spends most of his time sleeping, only awakening to feast on all life within defeated nations as the price of failure. If forcibly roused, Zevgavizeb is filled with such fury that he can rampage for years before returning to sleep.


## Appearance

> Zevgavizeb is a truly hideous monster even by [[Abyss|Abyssal]] standards, which is full of monsters: he is a [[Dragon|dragon]]-sized beast, part reptile, part [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bat]], part overgrown worm. Features often ascribed to Zevgavizeb include a massive, fang-filled maw, massive sharpened wings, and acidic tentacles lined with suckers and jawless mouths.
> Zevgavizeb exudes a horrific stench that can permanently nauseate anyone who smells him. In his presence, his [[Occult magic|occult]] power is strong enough to tear enemies apart with but a thought. His screams can be heard across the entire Abyss, whether he is sleeping or rampaging through Gluttondark.


## Relationships

> Zevgavizeb is friendly with fellow ex-qlippoth lords who became demons, like [[Jubilex]] and [[Yhidothrus]], and sometimes considers them to be family. In contrast, he despises qlippoth lords who did not, especially [[Rovagug]], whose followers often clash with his own; and [[Shiggarreb]], who has been trying to convert the xulgaths of [[Deep Tolguth]] to her worship. He grudgingly respects [[Nocticula]], [[Lamashtu]], and [[Dahak]], due to their shared areas of concern, but also views them as rivals whom he might have to usurp in his own bid for [[God|godhood]].


## Cult and worshippers

> Zevgavizeb cares little about events in Gluttondark except to satiate his immense hunger when he emerges from his long hibernations, and shows no interest in the rest of the Great Beyond. As a result, he is perhaps the demon lord providing the least danger to Golarion, although the same cannot be said of the xulgaths who worship him and follow his tenets seriously, with little regard for their own safety: growing in number and strength, conquering, subjugating and sacrificing victims to him. They often breed with demons, particularly [[Vavakia|vavakias]], to give birth to [[Mutant|mutants]] who are believed to be the key to earning strength and Zevgavizeb's favour.
> Because he cares little for his flock, the worship of Zevgavizeb is generally disorganized and only consists of superstitious traditions, crude rock drawings, and ancient tales told over cold meals in the dark. For the most part, Zevgavizeb's followers have few goals other than survival and violence, and are uninterested in studying texts, but prefer to bask in power through bloodshed, strength, stealth, and dominion.
> Zevgavizeb's xulgath worshippers live in mortal terror of his hunger. They believe that when he awakens from his slumber, the weak are the first to be culled. When faced with difficulties, they often look to him for guidance, and Zevgavizeb only has one answer: thin the herd. Because of this brutal cycle of warfare and [[Cannibalism|cannibalism]], Zevgavizeb's worshippers tend to be culturally and [[Technology|technologically]] primitive.
> Zevgavizeb demands his worshippers to consume at least one meal of warm-blooded flesh daily, so devout xulgaths usually keep a pen of such prey on hand. Another tradition involves dancing and screaming around an impaled sacrificial victim; for this purpose, xulgaths build their largest cooking fires alongside concentric rings of butchery tables located around a large, sharpened stalagmite.
> Although Zevgavizeb is known primarily as the patron of the xulgath race, he is also worshipped by debased tribes of [[Iruxi|iruxis]], [[Morlock|morlocks]] (who worship him primarily as a god of caverns), [[Gug|gugs]], and [[Saurian|saurians]]. His saurian followers primarily wage war against other saurians, and their talent for training [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaurs]] for war is unparalleled. The combination of internal power struggles and constant opposition from other saurians that view them as abhorrent degenerates has kept them isolated.
> On the surface, Zevgavizeb also attracts a small following of [[Evil|evil]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] who mix [[Primal magic tradition|primal]] with [[Divine magic|divine magic]] to augment their bodies.
> The greatest temples to Zevgavizeb are located in [[Orv]] and were built by the xulgaths during the height of their civilisation. The most terrifying among them is the Pyramid of Frozen Screams, located in a satellite cavern of Deep Tolguth, in a stone city at the heart of Orv. Unlike their surface-dwelling kin, the xulgaths living in this city can still recall their racial name.
