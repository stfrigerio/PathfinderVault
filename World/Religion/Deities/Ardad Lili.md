> **Ardad Lili** is a [[Queen of the Night]], a [[Demigod|demigoddess]] who began her existence as an [[Angel|angel]] but joined [[Asmodeus|Asmodeuss]] exodus to [[Hell]].



## Appearance

> The End of Innocence resembles a beautiful, dark-skinned [[Humanoid|humanoid]] woman who tends to wear the colors green and white. Only her wings, composed of slithering [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake]] tails instead of feathers, reveal her monstrous nature, although they still afford her rapid and agile flight. Some sources also depict her with a snake-like tail.
> While Ardad Lili generally leaves fighting to her legions of minions, she wields her thin, deceptively powerful ivory-bladed [[Dagger|dagger]] with impressive and deadly skill. Generally, however, she prefers to turn enemies into allies through [[Magic|magic]] or her own eloquence.


## History

> In the time when [[Mortal|mortals]] were still new to the [[Multiverse|multiverse]], Ardad Lili was an angelic servitor of [[Shelyn]], who was at that point a minor [[Deity|deity]]. Tasked with inspiring [[Art|artists]] on behalf of her patron, she became increasingly disgusted with the lust she saw in eyes of her assignments. As her disgust turned to hate, she started convincing mortals to swear their obedience and eventually their [[Soul|souls]] to her in exchange for what she called a "stainless caress," wherein she generally gave nothing in return, as she never intended to keep her promises. This escalated to the murder of those mortals who resisted her wiles, then to recruiting other disaffected angels, then to plotting to overthrow the lords of [[Nirvana]]. Eventually, Shelyn's servitor Phoenix Tail came to Ardad Lili and confronted her; understanding that she was not yet strong enough to defeat the servitor, the disillusioned angel responded by gathering her allies and joining [[AsmodeusExodus|Asmodeuss Exodus]] to [[Avernus]].
> In Hell, she holds an exalted position, despite Asmodeus' misogyny. Ardad Lili is seen as a seducer, taking great pleasure in debasing and manipulating men, whom she considers the 'dimmer sex.' In truth, however, her reputation as a seducer is the result of a dedicated and intentional disinformation campaign by Ardad Lili over thousands of years, that she might leverage this notoriety to her advantage.


## Relationships

> Ardad Lili has developed strong alliances with the three other Queens of the Night: [[Doloras]], [[Eiseth]], and [[Mahathallah]]. The four realized that none of their interests conflicted, so they joined forces and over time have become close to what could be considered true allies.


## Servants

> Ardad Lili has amassed an army of fallen angels, [[Erinyes|erinyes]], female [[Devil|devils]], damned [[Soul|souls]], and deranged [[Mortal|mortals]], all with the intent to eventually invade Nirvana and finally rule part of the heavens.


## Worship and followers

> As with the other Queens of the Night, Ardad Lili's faithful tend to be women, particularly those who use cunning, manipulation, and seduction to achieve their ends. As befits her origin, many artists still find inspiration from her, though generally those of wicked bent.


### Obedience

> Some devotees of Ardad Lili are granted special powers by spontaneously composing songs with lyrics containing intentionally deceitful promises.


### Unholy symbol

> Her [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] is either a pair of wings composed of snake tails or a forked-tongue emerging from slightly parted lips.
