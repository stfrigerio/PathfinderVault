> **Abhoth** is the [[Outer God]] of [[Disease|disease]], fecundity, and [[Ooze|oozes]].



## Appearance

> Abhoth appears as a massive ooze whose eyes, mouths, organs, and pseudopods constantly form and are consumed.


## Realm

> Abhoth dwells in a grotto connected to the deepest forgotten or undiscovered underground caverns of many [[Planet|planets]].


## Servants

> Oozes constantly form and slough off from Abhoth's bulk. Abhoth's pseudopods grasp many offspring and reabsorb them into its mass, but some manage to escape and find [[Portal|portals]] from Abhoth's lair to the caverns in other worlds. These spawn can spawn races of their own, and through them Abhoth can see, explore, and infect any world they touch.


## Worshipers and clergy

> According to Abhoth's cultists, all life in the [[Material Plane]] is descended from it.


## On Golarion

> Cerain remote tunnels in the [[Darklands]] connect to the cavern where Abhoth dwells. One such tunnel is located in the [[Midnight Mountains]] in [[Orv]], where the [[Primal Mouth]], one of Abhoth's most powerful spawn, resides with its [[Gug|gug]] minions.
