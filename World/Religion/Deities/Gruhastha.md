 A depiction of Gruhastha holding a [[Book|book]].
> **Gruhastha** is a male [[Vudra|Vudran]] [[Deity|god]]. He was a [[Mortal|mortal]] nephew of [[Irori]] who, according to legend, [[Ascension|ascended]] to divinity by authoring a [[Book|book]] so perfectly profound that he merged with it and became a god—the *Azvadeva Pujila*.

## Role

> Gruhastha is called the Keeper as he keeps watch over [[Golarion]] until enough beings reach enlightenment, at which point the world would itself become part of [[Nirvana]].


## Relationships

> Gruhastha is the nephew of Irori and an ally of the Master of Masters in the role of his advisor.


## Church


### Holy text

> Gruhasthans consider all books to be [[Holy|holy]], but none surpasses the *Azvadeva Pujila*, which is both an incarnation of Gruhastha himself and his greatest work of text. The work is relatively informal for a holy book and full of fables, each with layers of hidden wisdom.


### Holidays

Azvadeva Dejal
Annually on 3 Desnus, worshipers mark the revelation of the *Azvadeva Pujila* by gifting books, celebrating knowledge, blessing [[Animal|animals]], and enjoying a vegetarian feast.

> [[Paizo]] published major articles about Gruhastha in *[[Faiths of Golarion]]* and *[[Lost Omens Gods 26 Magic|Lost Omens Gods  Magic]]*.
