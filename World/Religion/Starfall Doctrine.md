> The ***Starfall Doctrine*** is a series of prophecies written in [[Azlanti language|Azlanti]] that predicted that the [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]] would return to [[Golarion]] in [[4606 AR]] and lead the [[Human|human]] race in a millennium of prosperity known as the [[Age of Glory]]. He was supposed to lead the world from [[Cheliax]], which he would personally rule and which would also become the pre-eminent nation in the world.
> When the appointed year came, instead of Aroden's appearance, his [[Cleric|clerics]] lost all connection to the god, and he has been assumed dead ever since. The Age of Glory never commenced and was replaced by the [[Age of Lost Omens]]. The monarchy of Cheliax, robbed of its divine mandate as a precursor to Aroden's god-rule, descended into anarchy and [[Chelish Civil War|civil war]].
