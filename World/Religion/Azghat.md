> The **Azghat**, according to [[Shoanti]] lore, are the ancient [[Deity|gods]] from prehistory that carried the Shoanti to the [[Storval Plateau|Storval Plain]]. The "pantheon" originally brought order and peace and, in particular, ordered the Shoanti into seven tribes based on [[Lissala|Lissalan]] tenets.
> Under duress from external enemies, the Azghat turned [[Evil|evil]] and the Shoanti reluctantly turned against them. Soon thereafter, the kingdom of the Azghat pantheon ended. Modern Shoanti still look forward to the honour of the Azghat being restored. The Shoanti consider the [[Sihedron|seven-pointed star]] a symbol of their unity against the Azghat, and tales of the Azghat are unique among the Shoanti for being recounted identically across all seven [[Quah|quahs]] by their lore-keepers.
> In reality, "Azghat" is simply the name given by the Shoanti to the [[Runelords|runelords]] of ancient [[Thassilon]], under whom they served as warriors for many generations, and passed down in the quahs' oral history. For example, the Thassilonian deity Lissala is referred to by some Shoanti [[Shaman|shamans]] as "the goddess of the Azghat".
