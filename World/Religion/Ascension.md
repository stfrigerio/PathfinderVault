> The process of a [[Mortal|mortal]] becoming a divine entity, such as a [[Deity|god]], is often referred to as **ascension**. This term is most prominently associated with the [[Test of the Starstone]], which resides in the [[Starstone Cathedral]] in [[Absalom|Absaloms]] [[Ascendant Court]]. Mortals who pass the test become deities, known collectively as the [[Ascended]], and their followers celebrate their ascension on holidays called [[Ascension Day]], [[Ascendance Day]], or Ascendance Night.
> However, other forms of ascension exist:

> - [[Gruhastha]], Irori's nephew, is said to have written a book so perfect and profound that he merged with it in the process of becoming a god.
> - [[Hanspur]], murdered by drowning in the [[Sellen River]], was spared by [[Gozreh]] and rose to become a [[Demigod|demigod]].
> - The [[Iron Gods]] of [[Numeria]] ascended through alien [[Technology|technological]] and supernatural means.
> - [[Irori]] is claimed by his followers to have ascended by achieving physical and mental perfection.
> - [[Lao Shu Po]] ascended by eating the flesh of a slain god.
> - [[Nalinivati]] was once a mortal [[Naga|naga]] [[Sorceress|sorceress]]. She ascended to divinity through unknown means near the end of her life.
> - [[Ancient Osiriani]] texts suggest [[Nethys]] ascended through mastery of [[Magic|magic]] and knowledge that granted him omnipresent senses.
> - [[Nivi Rhombodazzle]] became a [[Godling|godling]] by trading a [[Gem|gem]] with [[Torag]].
> Natively [[Immortal|immortal]] beings and creatures with a divine spark shy of godhood have also ascended to become more powerful deities:

> - Tales of [[Gyronna|Gyronnas]] origins differ, but some claim she was an immortal [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fey|fey]] cast out into [[Mortality|mortality]] prior to becoming a goddess.
> - [[Nocticula]], once a [[Demon lord|demon lord]], became a goddess after redeeming herself from [[Evil|evil]].
