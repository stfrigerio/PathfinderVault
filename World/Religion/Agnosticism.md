*See also: [[Atheism]]*
> **Agnosticism** is a [[Philosophy|philosophy]] whose adherents believe that the [[Deity|gods]] and their actions are ultimately unknowable, and that it is impossible to truly know which powers are [[Divine|divine]] (and thus worthy of worship and adoration) and which aren't. A person who believes this is known as an **agnostic**. Despite agnostics' ambivalence towards the divine, they are not creatures without moral convictions, and often follow a philosophy or pay lip service to a god that is in line with their personal moral compass. When agnostics die, [[Pharasma]] judges their [[Soul|souls]] against their own character without punishment, much as any other [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioner]] who does not have a pre-determined fate (such as animists or polytheists). They are then sent to a plane that most closely mirrors their own beliefs in life.
