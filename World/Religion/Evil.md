> **Evil** is an axis of [[Alignment|alignment]] most commonly associated with acts that harm others. Evil people and creatures have little to no compassion for others, and will kill whenever it suits their purpose. These evil acts can be done out of selfishness and greed, for sport, or at the behest of an evil master. Evil influences in religious spheres may be termed **profane** as opposed to sacred.
