*See also: [[Agnosticism]]*
> **Atheism** is the rejection of the [[Deity|gods]]. Rather than outright disbelieving in gods whose existence is a matter of hard fact, atheists in [[Golarion]] instead deny that the gods are truly [[Divine|divine]] and thus not deserving of worship or blind faith. Thus, atheists may be classed as **dystheists** or **misotheists**.



## Atheism on Golarion

![[Prophecies_of_the_Kalistrade_symbol.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 The symbol of the [[Prophets of Kalistrade]], an atheistic organization.
> Atheism is looked down upon in many parts of Golarion, but is enforced on a state level in the nations of [[Rahadoum]] in [[Garund]], [[Touvette]] in the [[River Kingdoms]], and [[Bachuan]] in [[Tian Xia]]. Followers of the [[Prophecies of Kalistrade]], which is practically the state religion in [[Druma]], are predominantly atheists.
> Some atheists have learned to [[Medicine|heal]] themselves via mind-over-matter mental techniques in the absence of [[Divine magic|divine magic]].


## Atheism in the Great Beyond

> The [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Devil|devils]] known as [[Deimavigga|deimaviggas]] believe that atheism is a tool to be used to lead [[Mortal|mortals]] away from the gods and into [[Hell|Hells]] embrace.


## The fate of atheists

> Despite their lack of faith, atheists' [[Soul|souls]] are still judged by [[Pharasma]]. Some become bodiless [[Spirit|spirits]] in the [[Astral Plane]] or are reincarnated, but most find their fate in the [[Graveyard of Souls]]. [[Phlegyas]], the Consoler of Atheists, is the [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp usher]] of atheists who offers care to atheists when they arrive in the [[Boneyard]], and may even train some of those souls to become [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]].
