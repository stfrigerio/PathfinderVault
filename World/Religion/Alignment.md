 Alignment is a foundational aspect of [[Metaphysics|metaphysics]] that can manifest in many ways, including direct physical conflict between [[Outsider|creatures]] born of [[Quintessence|quintessentially]] aligned energies.
> **Alignment** is a concept of nine facets along two axes that broadly defines and classifies entities by their morality, ethics, and fundamental [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] composition.
> The concept of alignment covers a broad range of entities, with the exceptions of new [[Soul|souls]] and the purified [[Quintessence|quintessence]] of the [[Maelstrom]] known as [[Potentiality|potentiality]]. [[Mortal|Mortals]] are the most obvious, as their actions often (though not always) fit a specific alignment. [[Deities]] also often embody an alignment or small range of alignment, and expect their followers to do the same.
> However, alignment extends past sentient life to classify creatures, from [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Animal|animals]] to [[Outsider|outsiders]], based on their tendencies and behaviors. [[Plane|Planes]] are strongly associated with an alignment, and are formed from aligned quintessence. Even communities, organizations, nations, locations, and certain inanimate objects can have an alignment.



## Axes of alignment

> Alignment is commonly represented as a two-axis grid of nine segments, with morality as the horizontal axis  (represented as [[Good|good]], [[Neutral|neutrality]], and [[Evil|evil]]) and ethics as the vertical axis (represented as [[Law|law]], [[Neutral|neutrality]], and [[Chaos|chaos]]). These combinations can be abbreviated by the first letters of each intersecting pair of descriptors; for instance, [[Lawful good|lawful good]] can be abbreviated as **LG**:




[[Lawful good|LG]]
[[Neutral good|NG]]
[[Chaotic good|CG]]


[[Lawful neutral|LN]]
[[Neutral|N]]
[[Chaotic neutral|CN]]


[[Lawful evil|LE]]
[[Neutral evil|NE]]
[[Chaotic evil|CE]]


> At the center is the [[Neutral]] alignment, sometimes called true neutrality.

[[Law]]
Lawful entities value honor, trustworthiness, obedience, and dependability, but can be close-minded, self-righteous, and inflexible.
[[Chaos]]
Chaotic entities value freedom and flexibility, but can be impulsive, resentful toward authority, and irresponsible.
[[Neutral alignment axis|Neutral]]
Neutral entities feel little moral or ethical obligation toward any particular course of action, view dogmatic ethical or moral actions as dangerous in any circumstance, or have a strong tendency toward self-interest unclouded by prejudice or compulsion.
[[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good]]
Good entities value and protect innocent life, even at great expense to themselves.
[[Evil]]
Evil entities debase or destroy innocent life, sometimes for little or no reason.

### Unaligned

> The absence of alignment is rare in the multiverse, but is a fundamental aspect of creation. Quintessence reclaimed by the Maelstrom is purified of its alignment to become [[Potentiality|potentiality]], and sparks of unaligned potentiality join the [[Positive Energy Plane]] as an element in the creation of a soul.


## Changing alignment

![[Goblin_nursery.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Strictly adhering to an alignment can result in unusual circumstances.
> Alignments are rarely immutable. Actions that oppose an entity's alignment can change it, and some spells and magical effects can temporarily or permanently alter an entity's alignment. [[Curses of Golarion|Cursed items]] and powerful [[Artifact|artifacts]] can also forcefully alter an entity's alignment.


## On Golarion

> Alignment manifests in subtle, but tangible, ways on [[Golarion]]. For instance, certain [[Spell|spells]], such as *detect chaos* or *protection from good*, detect or only affect entities of a certain alignment axis. Items might be attuned to an alignment axis or specific alignment; a weapon attuned to chaos might cause more harm to a lawful being, or an item attuned to good might weaken an evil entity that attempts to use it.
> Perhaps the most visible delineation of alignment on Golarion comes from its religions and their followers. [[Paladin|Paladins]] must always be lawful good; evil, and even true neutral, deities do not inspire paladins, and paladins can physically smite creatures of evil alignment through their righteous fervor. [[Cleric|Clerics]] must fall in line with their deity's alignment and cannot cast certain spells opposed to her deity's alignment; furthermore, their alignment determines whether they can channel [[Positive Energy Plane|positive]] or [[Negative Energy Plane|negative]] energy. Unusual circumstances and entities—such as [[Low templar|low templars]], people with exceptional skill in using [[Magic item|magic items]], or the effects of spells like *undetectable alignment*—can mask or modify an entity's alignment.
> But even among a religion's more mundane followers, alignment has material effects. For example, [[Holy water|holy water]] blessed by a good deity can burn evil-aligned [[Outsider|outsiders]].


### In the Harrow

> The [[Harrow]] deck features six suits of nine cards each, and each card within a suit corresponds with one of the nine alignments.


## In the Great Beyond

> Each [[Plane|plane]] of the [[Great Beyond]] is associated with an alignment, and its inhabitants often exemplify certain aspects of the plane's alignment. For instance, the [[Abyss]] is strongly aligned with [[Chaotic evil|chaos and evil]], while [[Heaven]] is strongly aligned with [[Lawful good|law and good]]. As such, [[Demon|demons]] of the Abyss are chaotic and destructive creatures, and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Angel|angels]] of Heaven are lawful crusaders of compassion.
> This also manifests as the sorts of creatures who become [[Familiar|familiars]] of or are [[Magic/Conjuration|summoned]] by spellcasters.
