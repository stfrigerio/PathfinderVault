> **Ancestor worship** is a form of religion where ancestors, rather than [[Deity|god-like beings]], are venerated.


## Mwangi Expanse

> Ancestor worship as practised by the tribes of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] is something of a misnomer. The tribes revere their ancestors, but do not worship them, and there are no [[Cleric|clerics]] who derive their [[Divine magic|divine powers]] from ancestors. Instead, the spirits of the ancestors are seen as helping to guide and defend the people, and might be asked to intercede with an actual deity on their behalf.
> The [[Mwangi]] sometimes use carvings of trees as an aid in remembering their lineage.


## Elsewhere on Golarion

> The [[Shoanti]] and [[Tian]] participate in ancestor worship.
