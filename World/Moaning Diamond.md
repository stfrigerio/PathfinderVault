> The ***Moaning Diamond*** is well described by its name: it is a fist-sized [[Diamond|diamond]] that emits an unearthly moan; yet is is also a powerful [[Major artefact|major artefact]] granting its bearer power over earth and stone and the ability to [[Magic/Conjuration|summon]] an [[Earth elemental|elder earth elemental]]. It contains the essence of the defeated [[Elemental lord|elemental lord]] [[Sairazul]], the Crystalline Queen, forever tortured by the howling moan of the current Elemental Lord of Air [[Hshurha]], Duchess of All Winds.

## Other Associated Artefacts

> There were three other [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|beneficent]] elemental lords that were defeated by their [[Evil|evil]] counterparts and, it is postulated, that means there are three other major artefacts containing the [[Spirit|spirits]] of the other three: the *[[Gasping Pearl]]*, the *Garnet Brand*, and the *[[Untouchable Opal]]*.
