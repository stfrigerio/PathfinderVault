> ***Word of recall*** is a powerful [[Spell|spell]] that enables the spell caster, by designating a small familiar area at the time of spell preparation, to return to a designated area with no more than a word and across any distance on the plane of existence upon which the spell is cast. The spell does not permit extra-planar travel. 
> Within limits of the experience and power of the caster, additional creatures in contact with the spell caster (direct or indirect but unbroken) may be transported along with the caster.
