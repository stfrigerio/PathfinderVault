*This article covers the tavern in [[Absalom]]. For the [[Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild]] scenario, see *[[The Wounded Wisp]]*.*
> The **Wounded Wisp** is a tavern in the western [[Foreign Quarter]] of [[Absalom]]. Its proprietor and bartender is [[Heryn Gale]], who inherited the establishment from her father. The Wisp was one of the bars at which the [[Pathfinder Society]] was founded on 23 [[Desnus]], [[4307 AR]], and has served as an unofficial Society bar since.



## History

> The Wisp's role in founding the Pathfinder Society was in doubt for much of its history, with some Pathfinders contesting that the Society had been formally created instead at the [[Pig's Paunch|Pigs Paunch]]. However, writings of founding Pathfinder [[Kerinha Napsunar]] recovered in [[4719 AR]] confirmed the sequence of events—that the ideas coalesced during a pub crawl from the Pig's Paunch to the [[Crimson Coin]] and [[Vert Pippen]], then ending at the Wisp—but also further cemented the Wisp's claim as the home of the Society's naming, foundational concepts, and plans for the first [[Grand Convocation]].
> The first few Grand Convocations were also held at the Wisp, though membership soon outgrew the tavern's capacity and the annual meetings moved to the [[Blakros Museum]].


## Structure

> The tavern's walls of dark-stained wood and barred windows give it the appearance of a nondescript dive, with only a wooden sign bearing its name over the door's entrance and a lantern—the "wisp", as named by employees—hanging from it on a brass ring.
> The front door opens to a hallway decorated with minor Pathfinder trophies, and a coat check for patrons that is usually staffed by a teenager. Tables fill the main hall and a raised, railed dining area. Its bar is supported by kegs of [[Alcoholic beverages|alcoholic beverages]] and backed by a stained-glass cabinet stocked with a variety of harder spirits. Its small kitchen has a staff of three and features a wood-fired stove and stone tables for preparing appetizers and meals.
> The Wisp has a cellar that contains fine [[Wine|wines]].


## Relationships

> Due to the Wisp's importance to the Pathfinder Society, and frequent patronage by Pathfinders, the Society's members get discounts and preferential service. [[Adolphus]], assistant to founding Pathfinder [[Selmius Foster]], established financial assistance of uncertain terms to the Wisp after Foster's death.
