> A **winteryew** (also known as a **witch-tree**) is a magical [[httpenwikipediaorgconifer|conifer]] found only in the ever-winter realm of [[Irrisen]]. Brought to [[Golarion]] from somewhere else in the [[Great Beyond]] by the [[Baba Yaga|Witch Queen Baba Yaga]], winteryews are vital to survival of many other living things in that cold land, as most other plants have died or entered permanent hibernation after centuries of wintry conditions. The winteryew produces cones with edible seeds throughout the year, and its nutritious bark grows back even under the coldest conditions, providing a ready food source to many other creatures, including [[Human|humans]].
