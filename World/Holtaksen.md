 Symbol of the Five Kings Mountains, the centre of Holtaksen culture.
> The **Holtaksen**, or **mountain dwarves**, are one of the main subsets of the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] race alongside the [[Grondaksen]] and [[Ergaksen]], and live in fortresses built among mountain peaks.


## Appearance

> Holtaksen are usually a few inches taller than other dwarves. Their pupils are larger than normal, and they have long hair that is often worn braided.


## Culture

> Holtaksen dwarves feel a strong need to relive the glory days of the [[Quest for Sky]] and are the most militant of the dwarven cultures, often warring against [[Orc|orcs]] and [[Giant|giants]] and stockpiling great stores of treasure won in battle. They are not foolhardy, however, and make use of hit-and-run tactics in enemy territory and complex defenses in their campaigns. They also feel a strong pull towards heroic quests, and it is rare to meet a mountain dwarf who has never been on an adventure at some point in their life.
> Holtaksen clothing is mostly muted and dark, but every dwarf wears a piece of clothing, usually a scarf or bandanna, in bright colors matching their clan's traditional [[Gemstone|gemstones]]. This is referred to as a **glory ribbon**; if the dwarf dies in battle, their companions tear up the ribbon and weave it into their own clothing.
