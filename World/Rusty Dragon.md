> The **Rusty Dragon** is the oldest inn in [[Sandpoint]], and thanks to its owner and its ever-present "Help Wanted" board is also one of the most popular and [[Adventurer|adventurer]]-friendly. Owned and operated by [[Ameiko Kaijitsu]], the inn can be found just past the southern bridge overlooking the [[Turandarok River]] at the corner of Market and River Streets. Known for its spicy and exotic foods, it is a favorite at the community's annual [[Swallowtail Festival]] free lunch.



## Appearance

> This large wooden building is the first structure one encounters after crossing the southern bridge entrance into Sandpoint, marked by a sizeable [[Iron|iron]] [[Dragon|dragon]] that looms over travelers from the building's roof. Time and weather have taken a toll on the sculpture's iron form, which undoubtedly is the source of the tavern's name. Patrons enter through the inn's common room, its largest area, with over a dozen tables, a large stage, a hearth, and—of course—a bar.


## Services

> Some of the finest food and drink in all of Sandpoint can be found at the Rusty Dragon. In addition, rooms may be rented at full price, or at a discount for anyone with an exciting adventure story. The "Help Wanted" board by the bar provides a well-known waypoint for many townsfolk and travelers to hire mercenaries, adventurers, guards, handymen, and others possessing such interests.


### Lodging

> The inn features a dozen rooms, five of which are considered luxury rooms with their own commodes. All the rooms have names of dragon races and the keys to each room bears a small carving of the associated creature. The seven smaller rooms cost 5 [[Silver piece|silver pieces]] to rent, have one bed each, and are named the [[Black dragon|Black]], [[Blue dragon|Blue]], [[Red dragon|Red]], [[White dragon|White]], [[Green dragon|Green]], [[Drake]], and [[Wyvern]] rooms. The [[Gold dragon|Gold]], [[Silver dragon|Silver]], [[Copper dragon|Copper]], and [[Brass dragon|Brass]] rooms are luxury rooms, which cost 2 gold pieces (or half the prices if the guest is a storytelling adventurer). Guests are also allowed to sleep on the common room for 1 copper piece.
> The fifth luxury room, the [[Bronze dragon|Bronze]] room, is used only for special guests free of charge. This room has many rumors about it, including that the owner's mysterious lover lives there, or that it is haunted by a merchant who committed suicide in some exotic manner.


### Food

> During festivals and other special occasions, a fee of 3 sp is charged for an all-you-can-eat banquet during the patron's stay. Most of these include a new recipe Ameiko has come up with for this celebration. Most of these end up good, but some—such as [[Goblin brain cookies|goblin brain cookies]] or [[Porcupine skewers|porcupine skewers]]—end up as flops.


### Entertainment

> The stage in the common room allows musicians, actors, speakers, and bards of all types to perform for the crowd. The entertainers are allowed to keep any tips they earn. Adventurers are also invited to get on the stage to tell tales of their exploits, and Ameiko is known to offer discounts for real accounts of these deeds.


## Notable staff


### Ameiko Kaijitsu

> A former adventurer and the shunned daughter of [[Lonjiku Kaijitsu|Lonjiku]] and [[Atsuii Kaijitsu]], Ameiko has run and maintained the Rusty Dragon since she returned to Sandpoint in [[4701 AR]]. Well known for her fantastic cooking, exotic beauty, eccentric hairstyles, and skill at music, Ameiko is undoubtedly the primary reason for the Dragon's success.


### Bethana Corwin

> [[Bethana Corwin|Bethana]] is a timid, elderly [[Halfling|halfling]] woman who works at the Rusty Dragon as a maid. She is known to be very close to the inn's owner.
