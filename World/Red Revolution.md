> The **Red Revolution**, often just referred to as the 'Revolution', saw the founding of the modern, chaotic state of [[Galt]]. It started in [[4667 AR]].
> During that same year of the rebellion, the first [[Revolutionary Council]] is formed and the *[[PathfinderWiki/Items/Artifacts/Minor Artifacts/Final blade|final blades]]* are commissioned and put into service.
> Only a year later, the beloved Galtan [[Art|artist]] Irlyna Vosh is assassinated by [[Red Mantis assassin|Red Mantis assassins]]. Many scholars believe this act may have triggered further violence and upheaval during the revolution.
