### In currency

> Silver is commonly used in currency, generally with a value of 10 silver pieces per [[Gold|gold]] piece and 10 copper pieces per silver piece.


### In culture

> Where silver is a major part of a region's economy, it often gains greater cultural import. For example, the city of [[Kintargo]]—nicknamed the Silver City—is a center of the silver trade in [[Cheliax]], and many of its locations and features are named after the metal (such as the [[Silver Road]], the [[Silver Star]] shop, and its historical saviors the [[Silver Ravens]]).


## In weapons

*See also: Category:Silver weapons*
> While an inferior and expensive metal for weaponsmithing, [[Weapon|weapons]] that are designed to harm certain [[Outsider|outsiders]] can be crafted from silver. Silver is especially effective against devils, lycanthropes, and certain [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|good-aligned]] [[Outsider|outsiders]], so much so that against these creatures, even ordinary silver objects can be effective weapons of opportunity. Silver powder can also reinforce *magic circles* that ward against them.


### Alchemical silver

> Silver can also be integrated with steel—though not with [[Skymetal|skymetals]] or [[Cold iron|cold iron]]—through complex [[Alchemical|alchemical]] and metallurgical processes. Such **alchemical silver** weapons are more durable and effective than those made of pure silver while retaining silver's anathematic properties, though they are still less deadly in general use than pure steel weapons.
