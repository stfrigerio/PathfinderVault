> The **Taldan Imperial Navy Headquarters** are located on the [[Jadrishar Island]] just off the west coast of [[Oppara]]. They occupy most of the Jadrishar Island district. The island is surrounded by thick, blackened stone walls. Its one gate on the south side is a fortress unto itself. Large docks line the southern shore of the island and dozens of [[Taldor]]'s [[Warship|warships]] lie at anchor there.
