> **Raugsmauda's Reach**, the Isle of the Dead, was a cave-riddled volcanic isle in the [[Shackles]] that became the lair of the vicious [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|lich]] [[Raugsmauda]] after she fled from the [[Pit of Raugsmauda]] on [[Motaku Isle]] in [[4512 AR]]. Soon after the [[Eye of Abendego]] erupted in the north, Raugsmauda began to sail the archipelago as captain of the [[Ship|galleon]] *[[Naiegoul]]* one night each month. No ship is more feared in the starlit night than *Naiegoul* whose black flag bears the words "Geghalle Omutapura", or "Hope Vanishes" written in the [[Ghol-Gan]] language not spoken in millennia. Sickly yellow-gray fumes waft up from the rocky earth of the island and the towering [[Lurching Mountain]]. Unhealthy twisted trees wrapped by thorny vines grow up from the cracked land and undergrowth cover the rest of the island. Large [[Arachnid|arachnids]] patrol the black sand beaches, and fat, strange crows perch everywhere. The writhed forest of [[Steirwood]] hosts most of the hordes of undead that roam the island. [[Raugsmauda's Tower|Raugsmaudas stone tower]], six-stories high, is located at the western edge of the island, looming over a natural harbor. The long wharf of the *Naiegoul* is just out from the tower's heavy iron portcullis.
