> In ancient times, the tribes of [[Numeria]] exported a type of mineral known as **veinstone**. This stone was a particularly popular building material in [[Osirion|Ancient Osirion]], and the [[Four Pharaohs of Ascension]] constructed their true pyramid of it. The Ancient Osirians valued veinstone as a semi-precious stone, while today it is merely an interesting type of rock.



## Description

> Veinstone only occurs naturally in Numeria and parts of the [[River Kingdoms]]. The dense, light-green rock rippled with dark-green fissures is as hard as granite.


## Objects made of veinstone

> - [[Azghaad's Spire|Azghaads Spire]] in [[Sothis]]
> - The Veinstone Pyramid in Osirion's [[Valley of the Pyramids]]
> - The *Veinstone Pendulum*, a magical device in a [[Ramlock's Hallow|hidden demiplane]] synchronized with the *countdown clocks* of Osirion
> - The *eye of the overwatched*, a [[Psychic magic|psychic magic item]] housed in [[Absalom|Absaloms]] [[Blakros Museum]]

## Mentions in literature
