 North Point is the district on the far side of the bridge, North Bridge, seen on the right of this picture of the city of Korvosa.
> **North Point** was the first part of the mainland to be settled after the city of [[Korvosa]] began to expand from [[Endrin Isle]]. Encompassing the north-eastern quadrant of the city, it is home to many families descended from those early settlers, in addition to much of Korvosa's municipal infrastructure, including City Hall, the [[Longacre Building]], and the [[Bank of Abadar Korvosa|Bank of Abadar]].
