 Not all inhabitants of other [[Plane|planes]] welcome tourists.
> **Planar travel** occurs when creatures or objects move from one [[Plane|plane]] to another. There are multiple methods of planar travel, and each depends on the nature, properties, and connections between certain planes.



## Via planar overlap

*See also: [[Planar breach]]*
> Planes might intersect at specific coordinates of each plane's physical dimensions, making them [[Coterminous plane|coterminous]] with one another. Planar travel between the intersecting planes is possible at these points. One example in the [[Great Beyond]] is the intersection of the [[Material Plane]] and [[Plane of Air]].
> Planes that are coterminous at every point, resulting in a total overlap between one another, are considered to be [[Coexistent plane|coexistent planes]]. The [[Ethereal Plane|Ethereal]] and [[Shadow Plane|Shadow]] planes, for example, are coexistent with the Material Plane.


## Via transitive planes

> Most travel between planes that do not overlap or are directly connected to each other is accomplished by using [[Transitive plane|transitive planes]], such as the [[Ethereal Plane|Ethereal]] and [[Astral Plane|Astral]] planes, which overlap with or connect to both the home and destination planes. [[Magic]] [[Spell|spells]] capable of astral travel or [[Teleportation|teleportation]], such as *plane shift* and *[[Gate|gate]]*, can accomplish this.


## Via portals

> Whether from natural phenomena or magical intervention, [[Portal|portals]] can open direct point-to-point routes between multiple planes.


## Via vehicles

***Main article: [[Planar vehicle]]***
> For additional protection while traveling between planes, a [[Planar vehicle|planar vehicle]] can offer additional defenses and predictability compared to portals or magical travel.


## Practical considerations

> For creatures who call the diverse Material Plane home, planning for planar travel is counter-intuitively simple relative to a trip on or between its [[Planet|planets]]: the properties of the destination plane are strong and knowable in advance, as opposed to the often wildly varying and dynamic traits that can be experienced within regions of a single Material Plane world, much less its many physical phenomena.
> [[Elemental Plane|Elemental planes]] are strongly associated with one [[Element|element]] at the exclusion of others, for exampleâ€”travelers do not need to pack cold-weather clothing for a trip to the [[Plane of Fire]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|goodly]] creatures know they have less to fear in [[Heaven]] than [[Hell]] (and vice versa for [[Evil|evil]] beings, and something of concern in both [[Law|lawful]] planes for [[Chaos|chaotic]] creatures).


### Planar hubs

> Prominent planes include at least one sanctuary area that can safely accommodate planar travelers, which are called **planar hubs**. These hubs are populous cities that act as capitals of their realms.
