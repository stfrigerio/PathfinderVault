Type: Ooze(fire)
Environment: Any volcano or underground
---

> **Magma oozes** are living masses of molten rock found in places of intense heat and [[Magic|magic]]. While most common at the boundaries of the [[Plane of Fire]] and the [[Plane of Earth]], they can also be found in [[Volcano|volcanoes]] and subterranean pockets of magma.
> Due to their molten nature, magma oozes are highly vulnerable to water, and exposure to it runs the risk of petrifying them until the water recedes.


## Variants

> Numerous variants of magma ooze exist, usually brought about by peculiarities in the rock and the magic from which they formed:

> - **Brimstone oozes** are formed under the influence of [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] magic, and their surfaces are covered in patterns reminiscent of monstrous faces.
> - **Crystalline oozes** form from rock rich in minerals. They contain numerous pockets of gas, which when struck tend to erupt violently.
> - **Poisonous oozes** are highly [[Toxic|toxic]] in addition to being burning hot, whether due to the presence of toxic compounds in the rocks from which they formed, or because they arose in magically contaminated areas.
