> **Iron** is a common [[Metal|metal]] found and used across [[Golarion]]. Slightly impure iron can form steel, a considerably sturdier metal, although not all societies have the ability to craft steel. Iron is often a successor to bronze, a weaker metal that is simpler to work with.
> However, even in steel-making societies iron still has myriad applicationsâ€”it features as a material used in cookware, tools, [[Weapon|weapons]], [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]], and building materials. It is vulnerable to oxidation, which results in brittle rust.



## On Golarion

> In most markets, one pound of pure iron is worth about one [[Silver piece|silver piece]]. Raw ore is typically graded between 5% and 60% purity, with most grading around 25%.
> Iron is [[Magnet|magnetically]] sensitive.


### In buildings

> Iron can be used in the construction of especially sturdy buildings; iron walls, doors, and gates are harder and more difficult to break down than wood or stone.


### In items

![[Cauldron_item_card.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Cauldrons are often cast from iron.
> Many common tools are made of or use iron, including chests, bars, chains, cages, [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Horse|horseshoes]], and climbing pitons. Iron also finds use in less common objects, such as sunrods.
> Iron's conductive properties make it a popular cookware material, although most iron cookware lacks the non-stick properties of [[Mithral|mithral]], which is also lighter but vastly more expensive. A portable cooking kit might include an iron pot, skillet, and mounting tripod.
> Iron is sometimes used to craft [[Holy symbol|holy symbols]]. While the material has no inherent magical properties, some religions might consider iron important to their faith.
> Some [[Potion|potion]] bottles are made of iron for additional sturdiness.


### In weapons

> Iron is commonly used in heavier bludgeoning weapons, such as [[Club|clubs]], [[Flail|flails]] and rams, as well as in the tips of [[Crossbow|crossbow]] bolts. Iron commonly adds strength and weight to a weapon, which are useful when the goal is to shatter foes' armor. Iron-tipped distance arrows extend an archer's range while reducing their lethality.


### In armor

***Main article: [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor]]***
> Lamellar armor is comprised of plates strung together in parallel rows. Iron pieces of lamellar armor are among the most common and heaviest, rivaled in weight only by stone and in frequency only by steel.


### In magic

> Several spells allow a [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]] to take on or imbue the traits of iron to other materials, or even people. Other spells can spontaneously generate entire walls made of iron, while still others can rapidly oxidize iron to turn iron objects into brittle rust.
> Iron is also used as a [[Material spell component|material spell component]], often in the form of powder or filings.
> Many [[Magic item|magical]] [[Rod|rods]] are crafted from iron, including *immovable rods*.


### In creatures

> [[Rust monster|Rust monsters]]' namesake ability comes from their ability to corrode objects made of iron, steel, and [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]] to rust within seconds, and their fluids can be processed to form rusting powder, which has the same effects.
> [[Iron golem|Iron golems]] are [[Golem|golems]] animated from 5,000 pounds of iron smelted with additional expensive tinctures.
> [[Iron cobra|Iron cobras]] are [[Construct|constructs]] in the form of iron [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]].


### Mining

> Iron mines are scattered throughout the [[Inner Sea region]], particularly in mountain ranges like the [[Mindspin Mountains]], [[Aspodell Mountains]], and [[Five Kings Mountains]], but also including places as varied as [[Dustpawn]] in [[Isger]] and Radya's Hollow in [[Nirmathas]], and [[Dwarf|dwarven]] cities like [[Skelt]].
> In addition to mining, some places recycle iron abandoned on battlefields as weapons, such as the [[Gnome|gnomish]] settlement of [[Jovvox]] in the [[River Kingdoms]].


## Variants


### Ironwood

***Main article: [[Ironwood]]***
> *Ironwood* is the product of [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druidic]] magic, and is a form of wood with the strength, weight, and fire resistance of steel.


### Cold iron

***Main article: [[Cold iron]]***
> Cold iron is a delicate form of iron mined from deep locations underground and forged at a lower temperature than typical iron. The resulting items have an [[Anathema|anathematic]] property against [[Demon|demons]], [[Fey|fey]], and certain other [[Magic|magical]] creatures. Purified cold iron can also be used an [[Alchemical reagent|alchemical reagent]] related to [[PathfinderWiki/Magic/Abjuration|abjuration]] magic.


### Djezeteel

***Main article: [[Djezet 1]]***
> Djezeteel is an alloy invented by [[Karamoss]] of iron and small amounts of [[Djezet 1|djezet]], a liquid [[Skymetal|skymetal]] also known as "quickiron".
