 The vibrancy of the Impossible Lands.
*For another meaning of "Impossible Lands", please see [[Impossible Lands sourcebook]].*
> The **Impossible Lands** is a term collectively referring to a [[Microregion|microregion]] comprising of the [[Mana Wastes]] (including [[Alkenstar]]), and the nations of [[Geb's Rest]], [[Nex]] and [[Jalmeray]]. They are named as such due to their fantastical nature and are dominated by their two most powerful nations, Geb and Nex. Their founders, the two [[Wizard|wizard]]-kings [[Geb (person)|Geb]] and [[Nex (person)|Nex]], waged a centuries-long [[Arcane magic|arcane]] war that scarred the land itself. Unlike in most other parts of [[Golarion]], knowledge of [[Magic|magic]] and [[Alchemy|alchemy]] is commonplace, even among ordinary citizens.
