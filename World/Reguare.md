> **Reguare** is an isolated expanse of [[Nar-Voth]] that lies beneath the ancient holdings of [[Ghol-Gan]] empire. The so-called **Sleepless Realm** was cut off from the rest of the [[Darklands]] during [[Earthfall]], and many of the entrances that connect [[Golarion]]'s surface to Reguare were buried at the same time.
> Among the few passages that remain are a tunnel buried beneath tons of rock and rubble in the catacombs under the infamous fortress of [[Eel's Skull|Eels Skull]] on [[Nalt's Island|Nalts Island]], and a hidden entrance beneath the [[Crimson Citadel]] of the [[Red Mantis assassin|Red Mantis assassins]] on [[Mediogalti]].
> There is only one major tunnel that runs through Reguare, called in ancient times the [[March of Madness]]. Much shorter than the [[Long Walk]], the March of Madness features halls of cyclopean size and its caverns, hundreds of feet tall, were obviously home to colossal creatures. Strange inscriptions on the walls sometimes span from floor to ceiling.
> Scholars suggest that the [[Cyclops|cyclopes]] of Ghol-Gan captured and tamed [[Purple worm|purple worms]] or other slithering behemoths to use as mounts in their wars against the [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]], and the March of Madness served as a valuable passageway for Ghol-Gan cavalry on their campaigns. Some caverns within Reguare contain primordial jungles, and many hot springs and lava vents draw treacherous monsters.
