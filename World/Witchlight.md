> The **Witchlight** is a prominent inn on the Warehouse Row in the city of [[Bloodcove]]. The large and comfortable building is made of wood from the same twisting mangrove trees over whose roots Bloodcove stands. Moss hangs from the inn's eaves and glow faintly in moonlight, giving the inn a strange ghostly appearance. The [[Aspis Consortium]] secretly controls the inn where most new visitors to Bloodcove stay. The Consortium have replaced its first two "owners" and now it assigned a third agent as the current owner, named [[Byshek Obeil]]. Obeil uses his staff to spy on visitors and collect information on the Consortium's behalf.
