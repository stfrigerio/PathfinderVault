> **The Test of the Starstone** is a test that anyone can take by attempting to reach the *[[Starstone]]* in the [[Starstone Cathedral]] at the center of [[Absalom|Absaloms]] [[Ascendant Court]] district. The *Starstone* is surrounded by a large, deadly maze containing traps, guardians and wards. The exact nature of the obstacles changes over time, but constant hazards include [[Magic|magic]] not always working right and prevention of extra-dimensional movement. Those few who pass [[Ascension|become demigods]], while those who fail usually die, although a select few manage to escape, occasionally with great wealth, but no divinity.


## History

> The first known person to pass the test was [[Aroden]], who did so when he took the stone from the bottom of the sea to the [[Isle of Kortos]] in [[1 AR]] when he founded the city of Absalom. Since then, only three of the vast number who took the test have passed: [[Norgorber]], whose life prior to the test is unknown; [[Cayden Cailean]], who took it on a drunken bet; and [[Iomedae]], a worshiper of Aroden who became his [[Herald|herald]].


## Clues to the Test

> The Test of the *Starstone* is mysterious; the only publicly known part of the test is that hopefuls must cross the bottomless pit surrounding the Starstone Cathedral without using a bridge. Crossing the pit is a necessary first step, but not sufficient to enter the cathedral and continue the test, and what has worked for one hopeful may fail for another. Hopefuls have leaped across, flown with magic, or used tightropes, and the spectacle of an attempt nearly always draws an enormous, attentive crowd.
> The trials in the Test of the *Starstone* are set specifically for each individual that takes the Test, depending on their fears, strengths and weaknesses. As a result, it is impossible to correctly predict what one will have to face.
