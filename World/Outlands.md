> Outside the city of [[Dis]] are gray hills of fissured, barren earth stretching away from the city in all directions, forming the bleak landscape of the **Outlands**. Broken roads span this expansive realm, winding aimlessly, doubling back, and ultimately leading nowhere. The [[Soul|souls]] of slothful [[Damned|damned]] wander these paths, always seeking comforts they will never experience again. The only features that break up the dusty, rolling landscape are the garrisons of Dis. These fortress cities are where [[Dispater]]'s legions train for battle and construct machines of war.
> The Outlands are classed as one of the four regions of Dis alongside: the Ghettos, the [[Oppidan Maze]], and the Iron Heart.
