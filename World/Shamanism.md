> The **shamanistic** [[Mwangi]] people of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] believe the jungle is home to a myriad of spiritsâ€”those of trees, [[Animal|animals]], and the earth. [[Shaman|Shamans]] believe that they can communicate with these spirits and influence them into helping and protecting their tribe. The rituals shamans use to achieve this vary widely from tribe to tribe.
> The darker side of Shamanism, known as [[Juju|juju]], can have less benign effects, and is practiced by the sinister [[MwangiCulture|Bekyar]] people.
