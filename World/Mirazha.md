> Years ago, the town of **Mirazha** in [[Katapesh]] was a waypoint for weary travelers, then an mysterious disaster struck the town. Mirazha was deserted and travelers found the bodies of the townsfolk in the oasis on the edge of town. The bodies were desiccated and withered, all the moisture seemingly drained. For a time, Mirazha stood abandoned. Eventually the desert sands covered over the town, the oasis dried up, and the town was forgotten. Recently, an [[Evil|evil]] has revived the memory of Mirazha and its doomed inhabitants. Travelers report seeing a little town on the edge of a sparkling oasis, but if someone enters the [[Curse|cursed]] town, the town and the new victim vanish from sight. [[Adventurer|Adventurers]] in the area have yet to spot the cursed town, but sometimes they find the mummified bodies of the victims, buried in the sand.
