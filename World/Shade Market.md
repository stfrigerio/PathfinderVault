> The **Shade Market** district in the city of [[Ipeq]] in southern [[Osirion]], is built in and around the [[Pharaoh of Blades]]-era barracks. It is a market of durable goods as well as a market for goods that people wish to buy or sell out of the public eye. Especially, the upper story of the old barracks are ideal for trading illegally obtained goods. It, and the [[Sun Market]], are "regulated" and overseen by the fifteen-person Merchants' Council, which is led by [[Thovet Fena]].
