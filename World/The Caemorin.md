> The **Caemorin** is a sprawling, gently rolling steppe in southeastern [[Iobaria]] that lies between the great forests of [[Fangard]] and [[Duroth Wood]] and the [[Myrfrus River]]. Covered in a sea of tall grasses and dotted with stands of scrubs and coniferous trees, the Caemorin is known to hold both natural riches and great dangers, including exotic plants and [[Animal|animals]] unfamiliar to those who come from [[Avistan|the west]]. [[Humanoid]] trappers and [[Rashalka]] [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaur]] tribes hunt the numerous animals that wander the Caemorin's fertile plains for both their meat and their valuable pelts.
> In [[1900 AR]] the centaur of the Caemorin were united under the banner of [[Errindayn the Seer]] and sacked many of the region's humanoid towns, including the port city of [[Mirnbay]], which resulted in centuries of animosity between the races.
