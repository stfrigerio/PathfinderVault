## Properties

> The demiplane has normal gravity relative to Golarion, but [[Time|time]] passes much more slowly. Spending 56 years in the demiplane results in only 11 weeks passing on Golarion. The demiplane is effectively boundless, but traveling in a straight line eventually warps the traveler back to their origin. [[Magic]] behaves normally on the demiplane.
