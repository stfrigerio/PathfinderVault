> Similar to its relative, the [[Assassin vine|assassin vine]], the wolfberry bush is a stationary bush that is carnivorous. Since the bush cannot move, it relies on camouflage to lure its prey close enough to strangle them and feed on the bodies. Wolfberry bushes have been known to grow to look like  other berry bushes from the area. Even while changing its looks, the actual berries on a wolfberry bush always taste sweet with a bitter aftertaste. These bushes can grow to be huge monstrosities.
