> **Rockwasps** are deadly cousins to hornets, each roughly the size of a rat.  They are often found in the north of [[Avistan]], in and around the [[Hold of Belkzen]].  As their sting is fatal, they are often caught by [[Orcs|orcs]], who trap these insects into globes made of wax.  Crates of these globes are then fired into battle from catapults, where they shatter on impact, releasing the insects to wreak havoc upon their enemies.
