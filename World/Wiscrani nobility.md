> There are two groups of **Wiscrani nobility** in the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Westcrown]]: the so-called "Old Nobility" and "New Nobility."
> The Old Nobility is the group of Chelish nobles who existed prior to the ascendancy of the [[House Thrune]], and the New Nobility those that came after. The Old Nobility are most densely populated in Westcrown, an aristocratic preserve, and still maintain large holdings of land and wealth in the city. These families either haven't proven themselves with House Thrune, or haven't tried at all to impress the new rulers of the country. Many of the Old Nobility were disposed of by the new management after the [[Chelish Civil War]]â€”their titles worthless, family fortune confiscated, and names smeared, left with nothing but wounded pride and desire for revenge. Of the 50 noble families in Westcrown that existed prior to [[4606 AR]], a third were destroyed in the decade that followed, and 20 more relocated north to [[Egorian]].
> The New Nobility gained power in Cheliax by riding the coattails of House Thrune, and as such are most densely populated in [[Egorian]], the new capital. The most powerful New Nobility are the ones who directly aided the house during the Civil War. Others have since joined them, gaining power through politicking, espionage, and assassination. It is rumored that some of these noble houses have holdings not just in Egorian, but in [[Hell]] itself, with titles in both realms. The lesser noble houses hold positions in the government bureaucracy and church.


## Old Nobility

> Westcrown has 12 major noble families and over 24 minor ones. Eight of these houses have direct links to the [[Council of Thieves]]. Some prominent noble houses in Westcrown include:
