> The **Moot of Ages** is an annual meeting held on the summer solstice, hosted on the [[Isle of Arenway]] by the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of the [[Wildwood Lodge]]. The Isle is located within the [[Verduran Forest]] of [[Taldor]], at the confluence of the [[Sellen River|Sellen]] and [[Verduran Fork|Verduran Fork rivers]]. Druids from all over [[Golarion]] travel there to present their findings to the assembled [[Green Faith]] community. Conclusions are generally not reached through logic and the enforcing of dogma, but rather by listening for and interpreting the [[Will of the World]], the collective intelligence of nature itself.
