> **Sin magic**, also known as **Thassilonian magic**, is an ancient form of magic first practiced by the seven [[Runelords|runelords]] of ancient [[Thassilon]], based on the rune magic brought by the first emperor [[Xin]] from [[Azlant]]. In it, each of the modern seven schools of magic (with the exception of [[Magic/Divination|divination]], which was considered of lesser importance and added to the universal school) is associated with one of the deadly sins: envy ([[PathfinderWiki/Magic/Abjuration|abjuration]]), gluttony ([[Necromancy|necromancy]]), greed ([[Transmutation|transmutation]]), lust ([[Magic/Enchantment|enchantment]]), pride ([[Illusion|illusion]]), sloth ([[Magic/Conjuration|conjuration]]), and wrath ([[Magic/Evocation|evocation]]).
