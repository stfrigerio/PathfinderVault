> **Grallus Lock** was a failed attempt to create a lock for beaching and servicing large [[Ship|warships]] in [[Eleder Harbor]] near [[Sargava]].
> For a short time during [[Grallus|Baron Gralluss]] rule, it served as a naval yard. The city eventually sold it, and since then its ownership has frequently exchanged hands. Finally, the [[Nine Forts Collective]] trading company bought the secure and defensible Grallus Lock to use it for their [[Slave|slave]] markets and operations.
