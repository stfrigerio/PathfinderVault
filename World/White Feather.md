> **The White Feather** is the name of a guiding spirit or [[Deity|deity]] whose followers have recently emigrated to [[Qadira]] from the east. These monastic wanderers preach peaceful meditation, self-improvement, quiet contemplation, and the laying down of all trappings of societal status and material wealth. Their non-violent nature has brought them into conflict with [[Xerbystes II|Satrap Xerbystes II]], who sees them as a distraction from his ambitions of a war with [[Taldor]].


## True identity

> The White Feather's true identity is a complete mystery. Some believe it is simply an aspect of the god [[Irori]], while [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisians]] say that it is actually an ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] deity known as the [[Peacock Spirit]]. Others state that he is an obscure deity named [[Roidira|Roidira Dark Sister of Knowledge]], or one already known in the [[Inner Sea region]], such as [[Apsu]] or [[Shelyn]].
