> **Smoky Embers** is one of the taverns of [[Dragonsthrall]] on [[Dahak's Horn|Dahaks Horn]] island in the [[Shackles]]. Smoky Embers has burnt down and been rebuilt countless times. Its current owner is [[Hashal Ballock]], former second mate on the [[Ollo]]-berthed [[Ship|sloop]] *[[Philo's Fortune|Philos Fortune]]* that shipwrecked on Dahak's Horn years ago. She has managed to survive in this [[Evil|evil]] place, but she hopes someday to escape the dreaded isle.
