> **Grogrisant's Fang** is a huge basalt spire that sits just outside the city of [[Zimar]] in the [[Sophra Prefecture]] of [[Taldor]]. Grogrisant's Fang is so large that it actually casts a shadow over Zimar, sparing it from the worst of the heat during the intense summers. Due to its sheer size, the mountain is all but impossible to climb without [[Magic|magical]] aid. The [[Taldan Phalanx]] maintains an isolated watch post atop Grogrisant's Fang but it has proven to be very difficult to maintain and supply. Despite being named for the mythical beast, there is no evidence that the [[Grogrisant|grogrisant]] ever dwelt on or near this mountain.
