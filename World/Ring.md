## Magical rings

> Some rings are powerful magic items worn on the finger that grant [[Magic|magical]] powers to the wearer. A person may utilize only two such rings at a time; donning a third ring on another finger will render the third useless. There is at least one magic item, called a *hand of glory*, that can overcome this two-ring limit, though most [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|goodly]] folk find such a [[Necromantic|necromantic]] item abhorrent. Most rings provide a permanent effect while worn, though a minority of rings have charges. Rings may be forged only by trained [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]]. A ring's power runs continually or is activated by a command word, if needed. Rarely, a ring may be an [[Intelligent item|intelligent item]].


### Description

> Magical rings are usually finely crafted items sometimes adopting a motif symbolic of the power they can imbue their wearer. Most are crafted from precious metal such as [[Gold|gold]], [[Silver|silver]], or [[Platinum|platinum]].


## Signet rings

> **Signet rings** have a flat bezel, usually wider than the rest of the hoop, which is decorated, normally in intaglio, so that it will leave a raised (relief) impression of the design when the ring is pressed onto soft sealing wax or a similar material. They are used as the personal seal of an individual or of a noble house, often representing the [[Heraldry|heraldry]] associated with the noble family. A common use is to legitimise official documents or to seal letters.
