> **Sangpotshi**, sometimes called the **River of Life**, is a [[Philosophy|philosophy]] practised almost universally in [[Tian Xia]]. It proposes that karma and fate are what determine a [[Soul|souls]] position at the time of birth: deeds performed in a past life influence the class and quality of life into which the soul is next born. This form of reincarnation might continue through many lifetimes for a soul until, finally, the soul is able to move on to its final resting place in the [[Great Beyond]]. This belief in Tian Xia is closely tied to the political philosophy of [[Divine right|divine right]], which states that rulers derive their political legitimacy from being appointed by the [[Deity|gods]].
