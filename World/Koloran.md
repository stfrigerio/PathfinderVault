> **Koloran**, also known as "Old Koloran" to modern [[Human|humans]], was the name by which an ancient [[Cyclops|cyclops]] empire was known in the records of [[Iblydos]], which itself is one of the oldest human civilizations of [[Casmaron]]. The empire was founded by exiled cyclopes escaping from brutal [[Ghol-Gan]] but did not last long; today, the area that was Koloran is part of [[Iobaria]]. The empire was destroyed by the fall of the *[[Starstone]]* in the event known as [[Earthfall]], which also destroyed [[Azlant]], [[Ninshabur]], and [[Thassilon]].
> Though based in Casmaron, the cyclopes' realm once influenced areas as far-flung as [[Garund]] and [[Avistan]].
> The culture of the [[Casmar human ethnicity|Casmar]] seems to be related to Koloran. Relics of the empire include huge amphorae and jade jewellery.
> The god [[Prathos]], worshipped in the form of a cyclops by [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of [[Katrivish]] in Iobaria, may be a relic of this lost empire.
