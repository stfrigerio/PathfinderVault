> The **Lion Throne** is the seat of power of the [[Grand Prince]] of [[Taldor]], and is one of the two most well-known symbols of the ruler of that nation (the other being the [[Primogen Crown]]). It is both the actual chair upon which the Grand Prince sits, as well as a metaphor for the power and authority of the position and its current holder.
