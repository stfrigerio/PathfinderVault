> The towering **Pyramid of Masks** is the central structure of the [[Gozarin Necropolis]] in the vast [[Tremor Valley]] of [[Osirion]]'s central desert. [[Jetrieti I]] was entombed in the pyramid which was the first burial site of the famous Necropolis. The Pyramid of Masks was dedicated to the Jetrieti Dynasty and comprises dozens of levels both above and below ground. The above ground levels of the Pyramid of Masks are jealously guarded by the [[Jah-Ipo]] priesthood but the guardians of the lower levels are much more dangerous. Jetrieti Dynasty's most powerful rulers and their followers were buried in tombs guarded by barbed ubashki leopards and Jetrieti's personal legion of [[Mummy|mummy]]-guardians known as the Ashen Architects. Hieroglyphics in the complex often hint that a trapped [[Nightshade|nightwalker]] guards the lowest level of the catacombs.
