> **Microregions** (or **metaregions**) are smaller, local regions of larger areas, such as the [[Inner Sea region]] and [[Arcadia]]. While not delineated on official maps, microregions group nations and territories linked by geography, common history, trade routes, or other factors.



## Microregions of the Inner Sea region

> There are ten established microregions of the Inner Sea region:


### Absalom and Starstone Isles

***Main articles: [[Absalom]] and [[Starstone Isles]]***
> [[Absalom]] and the [[Starstone Isles]] ([[Isle of Kortos]] and [[Isle of Erran]]) are so significant and influential that they are considered one of the Inner Sea region's microregions all by themselves.


### Broken Lands

> The **Broken Lands** ([[Brevoy]], the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]], [[Mendev]], [[Numeria]], [[Razmiran]], [[River Kingdoms]], [[Sarkoris Scar]]) in northeastern [[Avistan]] is defined by scarcity and uncertainty. Survival is a constant concern, civilisation is frail, strange things rule the wild, and nations lack both prestigious institutions and social stratification.


### Eye of Dread

***Main article: [[Eye of Dread]]***
> The [[Eye of Dread]] ([[Isle of Terror]], [[Hold of Belkzen]], [[Gravelands]], [[Molthune]], [[Nirmathas]], [[Oprak]], [[Ustalav]]) is named as such due to the influence of the ascendant [[Tar-Baphon]].


### Golden Road

***Main article: [[Golden Road]]***
> The [[Golden Road]] ([[Katapesh]], [[Osirion]], [[Qadira]], [[Rahadoum]], [[Thuvia]]) is a major trade route where citizens are generally well-educated in [[Medicine|medicine]], [[Astronomy|astronomy]], [[Alchemy|alchemy]] and [[Mathematics|mathematics]]. The population is concentrated in cosmopolitan cities located next to coasts and rivers, while vast stretches of desert are left to monsters.


### High Seas

> The term **High Seas** refers to the [[Arcadian Ocean]] west of the Inner Sea region, including the [[Eye of Abendego]] and the islands of [[Hermea]], [[Mediogalti]] and [[Mordant Spire]], as well as the [[Shackles]]. Despite their danger, the seas are nonetheless an important trade route.


### Impossible Lands

***Main article: [[Impossible Lands]]***
> The [[Impossible Lands]] ([[Alkenstar]], [[Geb's Rest]], [[Jalmeray]], [[Mana Wastes]], [[Nex]]), named as such due to their fantastical nature, are dominated by their two most powerful nations, Geb and Nex. Their founders, the two [[Wizard|wizard]]-kings [[Geb (person)|Geb]] and [[Nex (person)|Nex]], waged a centuries-long [[Arcane magic|arcane]] war that scarred the land itself. Unlike in most other parts of the world, knowledge of [[Magic|magic]] and alchemy is commonplace, even among ordinary citizens.


### Mwangi Expanse

***Main article: [[Mwangi Expanse]]***
> ![[The_Mwangi_Expanse.jpg|right+hmed]] 

> The [[Mwangi Expanse]], including [[Vidrian]], the [[Sodden Lands]] and the city-states of [[Bloodcove]], [[Kibwe]], [[Mzali]], [[Nantambu]], [[Senghor]] and [[Usaro]], is so large to qualify as a microregion of its own.


### Old Cheliax

> ![[Old_Cheliax.jpg|right+hmed]] 

> The term **Old Cheliax** ([[Cheliax]], [[Isger]], [[Nidal]], [[Ravounel]]) refers to Cheliax, which has significantly been weakened over the past century, and the territories it has lost in that period.


### Saga Lands

> ![[The_Saga_Lands.jpg|right+hmed]] 

> The **Saga Lands** ([[Irrisen]], [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], [[New Thassilon]], [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], [[Varisia]]) is a vast wilderness in northwestern Avistan, where [[Azlant|Azlanti]] and [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] influence runs deep, and traditions and stories are the stuff of legends.


### Shining Kingdoms

> ![[The_Shining_Kingdoms.jpg|right+hmed]] 

> The **Shining Kingdoms** ([[Andoran]], [[Druma]], [[Five Kings Mountains]], [[Galt]], [[Kyonin]], [[Taldor]]) is heavily influenced by Taldor, which once controlled the entire region.


## Microregions of Arcadia

> - Deadshot Lands (Briarbough, Crownpeaks, [[Halana Theocracy]], Illani Plains, [[Tazuni]], [[Three Craters]])
> - Fallen Razatlan ([[Innazpa]], Nalmeras, [[Razatlan]], [[Xopatl]])
> - [[Land of the Northern Lakes]] ([[Degasi]], [[Port Valen]], [[Valenhall]])
> - Lands of Second Souls (TomalÃ¡n)
> - Primal League
> - Salt Stretch

## Microregions of Vudra
