> **Saltfish Camp** is a slave camp on the outskirts of the [[Pirate|pirate]] capital, [[Port Peril]]. [[Slavery]] is a very real threat that looms over the least fortunate residents of the pirate port. Out of sight and out of mind, Saltfish Camp is a collection of ramshackle huts that barely protect against the elements. Both pirate captains and amoral foremen come to Saltfish Camp to buy slaves from the camp's owner [[Firoj]]. Firoj's control of the camp is assisted by [[Talsetus]], a turncoat slave who acts as a friend to new slaves, gaining their trust and then betraying their confidence as soon as they begin plotting against Firoj; so far, this ruse has been brutally effective.
