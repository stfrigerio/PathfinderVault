> A **spellbook** — sometimes termed a **grimoire**, **shadow book**, **eldritch tome**, or **codex** — refers to collections of [[Spell|spells]] stored as writings. They are used by several types of [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]], but are most associated with [[Wizard|wizards]].



## Physical description

> Most spellbooks resemble hardbound paper books also known as **bound codexes**, but any object that collects written spells can suffice, and many variants exist. A new, empty spellbook can hold 100 spells, weighs about 3 pounds, and costs anywhere from 1 to 15 [[Gold piece|gold pieces]], while spellbooks containing spells can be worth tens of thousands of gold pieces to a buyer, depending on their contents.


### Variants

Folded codex
A pleated codex made of one long sheet of paper or several adhered to each other. While faster and less expensive to create than a bound codex, they are also more fragile and awkward to use.
Palimpsest
A reused spellbook whose spells have been removed (though not always completely) from the salvaged pages. Palimpsests are most often found in the possession of apprentices and low-end magic shops.
Scrolls
Distinct from the [[Scroll|ephemeral magical item]], codexes in scroll form predate bound spellbooks. Many scroll codexes use papyrus wrapped around spindles to make them easier to store and use. While rarely used by modern spellcasters, they are still employed by traditionalist [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and in parts of [[Garund]].
Tablets
Spells can also be engraved into solid materials, such as durable damage-resistant wood, student-friendly wax tablets that can be more easily erased than a palimpsest,, bone, clay, and rings of [[Metal|metal]] disks.
> Regardless of their materials, formats, and origins, most spellbooks become unique items whose design and contents evolve alongside their owners, and are often magically, mechanically, or [[Alchemical|alchemically]] secured, treated, or [[Trap|trapped]] in order to preserve their function and protect their contents.


## Writing in spellbooks

> Wizards scribe new spells into their spellbooks, with more complex spells requiring more space. Spells can be acquired from numerous sources, including:

> - from another wizard's spellbook
> - from an [[Arcane|arcane]] magical scroll
> - upon achieving a greater understanding of magic and spellcasting
> - after creating a new spell from independent research
> Spells can be rewritten through certain extraordinary means, such as a spell.
> Whatever the source of the spell, writing it into a spellbook is a costly business in terms of both time and money, since the process often requires special inks and materials. Likewise, standard [[Printing press|printing presses]] cannot produce [[Magic item|magic items]], including spellbooks.
> As personal items of a spellcaster, spellbooks also often contain copious non-magical writings that provide context for their beliefs, research, and practices.


## Reading from spellbooks

> Spellcasters who regularly prepare their spells perform simple preparation rituals to do so. For spellbook users, these rituals are often also recorded in the spellbook itself.

## Associations


### In crime

> Spellcasters who cast any significant spells within five miles of the [[Esoterium Lodge]] in [[Corentyn]] without being registered members can be punished by having their spellbooks confiscated and burned.


### In magic

> A spellbook can be temporarily stored in a random part of the [[Ethereal Plane]] by use of a spell.


### In wizardry

> Each wizard is required to study their spellbook every day in order to prepare [[Spell|spells]], and can prepare only the spells written in their spellbook, with the one exception of the [[Magic/Cantrip|cantrip]] *read magic* that all wizards can prepare from memory alone. Sometimes, wizards might share their spellbooks in order to copy new spells from each other's repertoires.
> Wizards who adhere to the [[Poleiheira|journals]] and works of [[Arustun]], founder of the ancient [[Jistka Imperium]], sometimes bond their minds to a spellbook in a way that makes its capacity effectively unlimited while obfuscating its contents from others. Such Poleiheira adherents also specialize in exploration instead of a specific [[School of magic|school of magic]].


### With creatures

> [[Venedaemon|Venedaemons]] slowly strengthen themselves from their victims' spellbooks.
> If given an opportunity, a [[Crepitus|crepitus]] goes well out of its way to destroy wizards and burn their precious spellbooks to ashes.
