> The **Varisian Run** is a mostly ocean-going trade route that was referred to as the **West Tack** until the relatively recent growth in trade with the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city-states of [[Korvosa]] and [[Magnimar]]. Although it predominantly hugs the western coasts of both [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]] for most of its length, its north-bound run begins in the inland rivers of the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. From there it changes onto ocean-going vessels at the [[Sargava|Sargavan]] town of [[Anthusis|Eleder]] in [[Sargava]] and heads north, quickly passing through the pirate-infested waters surrounding the [[Shackles]]. It makes resupply stops on [[Mediogalti]] and in western [[Cheliax]] before cutting across [[Conqueror's Bay|Conquerors Bay]] to reach its final destination, Varisia.
