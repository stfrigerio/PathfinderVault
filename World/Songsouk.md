> **Songsouk** serves as the [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]] district of the [[Karazh]] city of [[Ular Kel]]. Songsouk is named for the songs that fill it, some coming from the messenger [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird]] roosts that litter the district, while the rest come from the buskers that dot its streets. Songsouk is unabashed in embracing the culture of the [[Kelesh|Padishah Empire of Kelesh]], showcasing its beauty and splendour. The other citizens of Ular Kel mostly regard the Songsouk residents as spies and saboteurs that are somehow working to bring the city under the empire's thumb. For some unknown reason, a larger number of [[Undine|undines]] are born in Songsouk than any other district in the city.
