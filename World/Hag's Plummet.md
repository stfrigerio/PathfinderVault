> **Hag's Plummet** is a cliff southwest of [[Sandpoint]] that is popular as both a lover's getaway and suicide jump. It's name comes from a [[Varisian]] legend. Bevanaka was dismayed at signs of aging. A witch gave her a [[Potion|potion]] to keep her young and beautiful with the caveat that it would only last until she fell in love. Years later, the lonely Bevanaka fell in love, aged immediately, and was rejected by her love. She cast herself off this cliff in her sorrow.
