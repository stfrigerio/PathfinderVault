> **Opal Market** serves as [[Vyre|Vyres]] largest marketplace and sits at the city's heart. Unlike most, the Opal Market slumbers during the day and only truly comes to life during the evening and night. As the [[Sun|sun]] sets, the market fills with [[Drug|drug]]-pushing [[Alchemist|alchemists]], bizarre [[Courtesan|courtesans]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dinosaur|dinosaur]] tamers, stilt-walkers, and practitioners of strange [[Magic|magic]]. Almost anything a person could desire is for sale in the Opal Market often for outlandish or outrageous prices, and fortunes can be made or lost in a single evening. The market is overseen by one of the [[Kings and Queens of Vyre|Queens of Vyre]], the Queen of Delights [[Manticce Kaleekii]], who dwells in the nearby [[Cobweb Manor]].
