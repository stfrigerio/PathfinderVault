> Also known as the **Wise House** and **Library of Kortos**, the **Forae Logos** in [[Absalom|Absaloms]] [[Wise Quarter]] is the city's largest library, and one of the most extensive archives of written texts west of the [[Pit of Gormuz]].



## Structure

> The library is comprised of several themed wings that organize its collections, as well as reading rooms that sometimes display special relics. The building is located near the infamous [[Blakros Museum]].


## Collection of works

*See also: [[List of written works]]*
> As one of the greatest sources of knowledge in the [[Inner Sea region]], the district watch—known as the [[Learned Guard]]—jealously protects the library's [[Scroll|scrolls]], documents, tomes, and other written works. Absalom's [[Grand Council]] forbids the removal of any text from the library (as outlined in the Founding Law), except by unanimous agreement.
> The collection is bolstered by a Grand Council order requiring that every book brought into the city either be copied for the library or taxed [[Currency|a silver]] per page. Although enforcement of this law is haphazard, it has been quite profitable for the city both in gold and knowledge. [[Brivit Nae]], the Head Librarian and Conservator of the Logos, also orders two copies made of all works requested by patrons. Under her management, the Logos's collection has grown by 2 percent—a significant rate considering the library's collection dates back more than 4,000 years.
> The Logos also hosts archives of items and relics, many of which are classified as unconfirmed or unidentified and are stored in sub-basements at least three levels deep beneath the library.
