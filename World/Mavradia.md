> **Mavradia** was once a great [[Iobaria|Iobarian]] city and capital of the breakaway realm of [[Zastel]]. Founded upon the ruins of a [[Cyclops|cyclopean]] settlement in [[The Caemorin]] in [[1240 AR]], nearly one third of the city was destroyed during the [[Drakeplague]] of [[4519 AR]], when [[Dragon|dragons]] battled each other within the city's walls, convinced it held a cure. The city would later be attacked by [[Giant|giants]] from [[Fangard]], and subsequently conquered by rebellious insurgents in [[4607 AR]].
> Mavradia would finally collapse into ruin when the city was struck with a second plague that turned its survivors into "oozing deaths", mindless gelatinous creatures that attacked others. The settlement has remained abandoned since [[4659 AR]], left to the oozing deaths and dragons, both alive and [[Undead|undead]].
