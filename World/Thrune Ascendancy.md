> The **Thrune Ascendancy** refers to when [[House Thrune]] seized the throne of [[Cheliax]] ending 34 years of chaos and [[Chelish Civil War|civil war]] following the death of [[Aroden]] in [[4606 AR]]. The [[Treaty of Egorian]] was signed on the 19th day of [[Calistril]], [[4640 AR]], and marked the commencement of the rule of House Thrune over Cheliax and its territories. [[Loyalty Day]] is held each year on the anniversary of the signing the treaty.
> This event also created a new interpretation of the history of [[Cheliax]] with [[Asmodeus]] emerging as new patron saint of Cheliax replacing [[Aroden]]. Much of the history of Cheliax prior to the Thrune Ascendancy has been erased by the agents of House Thrune. New history books are produced every three months and the [[Order of the Rack]] have made it their responsibility to ensure that libraries and universities have the most up to date copies, burning the old editions in so called 'clarity pyres'.
