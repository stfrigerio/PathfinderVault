 Skeletons attack inside Harrowstone Prison
> The ruins of the notorious **Harrowstone Prison** lie to the south of [[Ravengro]], a small town in the county of [[Canterwall]], [[Ustalav]].



## Description

> The ruins of the prison of Harrowstone are contained within a stone wall served by a single gate on the southern wall. Within the ground the prison stands as a two storey building with an extensive underground dungeon complex beneath and a western balcony on which many executions occurred. Two observation towers guarded the campus from on top of the walls. The warden's house was situated to the south of the main prison building and, to the east, lay a prisoners' graveyard. Today the graveyard is a murky pond after the area collapsed due to the fire which destroyed the prison. Within the prison was a chapel to [[Pharasma]].


## History

> Harrowstone Prison and its supporting town, Ravengro, were established in [[4594 AR]] by [[Eigen Lorres|Count Eigen Lorres]], ruler of [[Tamrivena]] (Tamrivena is the area now known as the county of Canterwall). The count hoped to use the prison to increase his standing in Tamrivena and beyond and to provide a good income by taking major criminals from all over Ustalav. Harrowstone became the home of Ustalav's most infamous prisoners; they were collected twice-yearly from other prisons in every county to either spend the rest of their days there, or to be executed, usually by hanging. The idea was a profitable success for the count and Ravengro town.
> In [[4661 AR]], the summer prison convoy brought five exceptionally wicked prisoners: [[Hean Feramin|Hean Feramin aka the Splatter Man]]; [[Ispin Onyxcudgel|Ispin Onyxcudgel the Mosswater Marauder]]; [[Vance Saetressle|Vance Saetressle called the Lopper]]; [[Sefick Corvin|Sefick Corvin or Father Charlatan]]; and a man only known as the [[Piper of Illmarsh]]. These prisoners, led by the Splatter Man, seized control of the prison and killed the prison warden, [[Lyvar Hawkran]]. Before his death, the warden managed to thwart the escape of the prisoners but, in the panic that subsequently ensued, the prison was set ablaze killing all the prisoners and many of the guards. Additionally, the warden's wife [[Vesorianna Hawkran]] perished in the event. A statue, called the [[Harrowstone Memorial]], stands in Ravengro to commemorate this event.


## The Ruins Today

> The ruins lie atop a nearby hill so may be seen today from the town of Ravengro itself; the town originally served the prison as its main purpose, but now flourishes independently after the demise of the prison. The locals suspect the prison is haunted.
