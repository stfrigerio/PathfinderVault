> **Lady Martella Lotheed** is a minor noble in [[Taldor]] due to her half-[[Qadira|Qadiran]], half-[[Taldan]] bastard status. Her father is Count Mercater Lotheed, and her mother is Ammala Qusan, a Qadiran emissary.
> Mercater raised Martella with the Lotheeds, but she was ostracized to varying degrees throughout her life before becoming estranged after Mercater's death. She is now part of [[Eutropia Stavian|Princess Eutropia Stavians]] camp among Taldor's political factions, where she serves as a spymaster.
