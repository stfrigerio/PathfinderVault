> **Chan Ai-Huao** is a member of the [[Wise Council of Three]] who rule the island of [[Shenchu Bay]] in the [[Shackles]]. She is the daughter of Laleu the Rapier, an [[Elf|elf]] [[Pirate|pirate]] who won the respect of the inhabitants of Shenchu Bay and married a [[Tian-Shu]] woman in the process. Chan is greatly favored by the voteless common sailors but [[Lo Shei Wen]] openly opposed her calling Chan a "half-breed shark" or a "half-blooded mongrel". Her ship is the *Minkai's Grace*.
