> **Goerel** is a historical figure from the earlier days of [[Ular Kel]]. A priestess of [[Sarenrae]], Goerel protected Ular Kel from a rampaging [[Azi]] [[Dragon|dragon]] thus saving the entire city. In her honour, other followers of Sarenrae would later build the [[Spire of Azi]], which still towers over the rest of the city to this day.
