> **Eloiander of Ridwan** is the leader of the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druidic]] cabal in the [[Uskwood]] known as the [[Shades of the Uskwood]], and a prominent member of the [[Umbral Court]], the ruling aristocracy of [[Nidal]]. He is known for his hardline isolationist and anti-[[Cheliax]] stance in the Umbral Court.


## Appearance

> Eloiander is a tall [[httpenwikipediaorgalbinism|albino]] [[Human|human]] with white hair and black eyes. He is generally dressed in robes of webs continuously being spun by living [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spiders]].


## Associates

> Eloiander is the leader of an isolationist faction within the Umbral Court that wishes an end to Nidalese–Chelish relations. He believes that relations with [[Cheliax]] and the Chelish citizens who live in Nidal are a distraction from Nidal's true purpose: the "caring" for [[Zon-Kuthon|Zon-Kuthons]] chosen people. The druid would willingly sabotage relations between the two countries and drive out all Chelish citizens in order to bring this about. He also has an ongoing feud with Alkaiva of the Uskwood, a [[Caligni|caligni]] druid now living in the port town of [[Albatross]], and may have gone so far as to send assassins after her.
> Peloise White-Eyes and Tralayhi are direct lieutenants of Eloiander within the Shades of the Uskwood. It is said that nothing happens in the Uskwood without either of these two (and Eloiander by proxy) finding out.
> Eloiander orchestrated the capture of a dangerous [[Hive queen|hive queen]], and had her brought to the Uskheart, the center of the Shades' power in the Uskwood. There the hive continues to be studied in an effort to control its corruption, while Eloiander occasionally smuggles out her corrupted [[Hive warrior|hive warrior]] offspring for unknown purposes.
