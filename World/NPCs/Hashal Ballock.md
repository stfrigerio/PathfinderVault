> **Hashal Ballock** is the current owner of the [[Smoky Embers]] tavern in the town of [[Dragonsthrall]] on [[Dahak's Horn|Dahaks Horn]] island in the [[Shackles]]. Smoky Embers has burnt down and been rebuilt countless times. Hashal Ballock was the second mate on the [[Ollo]]-berthed [[Ship|sloop]] *[[Philo's Fortune|Philos Fortune]]* that shipwrecked on Dahak's Horn years ago. She has managed to survive in this [[Evil|evil]] place, but she hopes someday to escape the dreaded isle.
