> The **Moldering Emperor** is a powerful [[Neothelid|neothelid]] that was one of the very first creatures to be warped by exposure to [[Black blood|black blood]]. It lairs in the [[Hanging Forest]] in the vault of [[Orv]] known as the [[Land of Black Blood]], but can also be found hunting in the regions next to the forest.
> Its form resembles a neothelid covered in black ooze, and decorated with writhing tendrils and vestigial wings. It claims ownership of all of the Land of Black Blood that is in contact with black blood, and is hostile towards intruders.
> The Moldering Emperor is served, directly or indirectly, by the [[Cloaker|cloakers]] of the Hanging Forest.
> There are no known sightings of creatures similar to the Moldering Emperor. However, some fear that the unmapped depths of the [[Caltherium]] hide other such creatures, and if the Moldering Emperor was slain another monster would rise up from the lake and claim its territory.
