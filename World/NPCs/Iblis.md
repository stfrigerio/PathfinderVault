> **Iblis** is a mysterious figure in the cosmic history of the [[Inner Sphere]]. His true nature—whether he was a [[Deity|god]], [[Demon|demon]], fallen [[Angel|angel]], or something else—is unknown.
> Before the rise of [[Mortal|mortals]], Iblis ruled over many of the [[Genie|genies]] with an iron fist, and may have overseen the creation of the [[City of Brass]] on the [[Plane of Fire]]. When the genies sought to free themselves, the tyrant created the [[Get of Iblis|get of Iblis]] to destroy his wayward slaves. This led to the first and only alliance between the four major genie races and a war of genocide against Iblis's vile brood. Iblis fled into hiding and has remained so in the ages since.
