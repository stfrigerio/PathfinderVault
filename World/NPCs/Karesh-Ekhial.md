> **Herald of Disdain Karesh-Ekhial** is a [[Sepid|sepid]] general who leads the disciples of [[Ahriman]] in [[Ruins of El-Amara|ruins of el-Amara]]. The sepid [[Div|divs]] and the hordes of their subservient [[Ghul|ghul]] and [[Edimmu|edimmu]] thralls took over the ruins to establish a base near [[Osirion]]. They despise Osirion for its hand in banishing their vile patron from the [[Material Plane]] millennia ago. It is known that Karesh-Ekhial wishes to see Ahriman return, but her exact agenda beyond this is unknown to all but her most trusted companions.
