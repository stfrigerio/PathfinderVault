## History

> In the year [[3203 AR]] the wizard Socorro lead an uprising in the Ustalavic city of Carrion Hill after having heard of the rise of [[Tar-Baphon]] as the Whispering Tyrant. Socorro and his followers slaughtered thousands in a display of support and loyalty to the returned lich, which earned Socorro the appellation "The Butcher of Carrion Hill". At some later point in his life, Socorro underwent the transformation into a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]].
