> **Sveinn Blood-Eagle** is the former ruler of the [[Thanelands]], the largest Linnorm Kingdom, from his capital city [[Kalsgard]]. Before his departure to [[Valenhall]], he was the most respected, the most powerful, and the oldest [[Linnorm King]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]].


## Relatives

> Over the years, Sveinn sired over a score of children but never considered any of his successors wise and mighty enough to be a worthy heir.


## Background

> During his reign, Sveinn increased trade with both the southern nations and [[Tian Xia]] via the [[Path of Aganhei]], and expanded his realm toward key locations, most notably the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] mines at [[Kopparberget]], which he wrested from the control of [[Opir Eightfingers]]. He once planned to strike at [[Irrisen]] and reclaim the [[Raemerrund|lands]] that [[Baba Yaga]] stole from his people long ago, but cancelled this plan in [[4719 AR]] to travel to Valenhall and live out his last days. Immediately after he announced his departure, tensions flared in Kalsgard as his children Uldren Orcsbane, Birgun Whale-Eater and Yngvilda rallied their supporters and made a bid to succeed their father. Ultimately, it was Sveinn's daughter [[Thira Ash-Eyes]] who managed to kill a [[Linnorm|linnorm]] and succeed him after his departure.
