> **Bor Dralfo** is an officer (rank of Guardian Blade) in the [[Brotherhood of Abadar]], a paramilitary organization that is a branch of the church of [[Abadar]] in the city of [[Absalom]]. A resident of the city's [[Ivy District]] (which also is home to the [[Vault of Abadar]]), he has caused some trouble with the local district guard. They wish to keep foreign tourist money flowing into the district, and as such, tend to turn a blind eye to the more victim-less crimes, while Bor, using his innate god-granted powers to detect the presence of evil, would rather haul everyone off to jail.
> Dralfo appears as a dour-looking man with close-cut blond hair, steely blue eyes, and a square jaw. He can often be found patrolling the district with a troop of fellow Brotherhood members, looking for evil-doers.
