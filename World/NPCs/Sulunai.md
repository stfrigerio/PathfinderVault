> **Sulunai** is an important figure in the history of the [[Aasimar's Mercy|aasimar]] nation of [[Tianjing]], saving the country when it was on the verge of collapse. Before its fall, Tianjing had enjoyed an exceptionally good relationship with [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]], the empire had provided Tianjin with food, protection and all sorts of other resources as a way to curry favour with Heaven. When Lung Wa fell in [[4606 AR]] Tianjing was totally unprepared, unable to support itself and with its armies atrophied after centuries of peace it suddenly found itself incredibly vulnerable in a new, hostile world. Destruction swept the country and was only halted by Sulunai, a enigmatic young assimar woman who served as a voice of reason and unity. Sulunai is today credited with the salvation of Tianjing, which is well on its way to total recovery from the hardships and disasters it has had to endure.
