> **Talsindro Yarmaht** was an [[Elf|elven]] geographer, explorer and bard who lived before the [[Age of Lost Omens]].
> He was obsessed with mapping the underground territory of the [[Roper|ropers]], a task which he undertook for nearly five hundred years until he disappeared. He left behind letters and maps. These depicted a series of chasms which marked out the shape of an ancient glyph.
> Today, his papers are kept under lock and key at the [[Grand Lodge]] of the [[Pathfinder Society]] in [[Absalom]]. Rumours claim that anyone who gazes upon the maps suffers incurable and endless bleeding from their eyes, a type of stigmata.
