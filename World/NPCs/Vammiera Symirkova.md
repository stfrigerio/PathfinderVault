> Despite her unassuming appearance as a well-aged 80 year old, [[Aristocrat|aristocrat]], **Lady Vammiera Symirkova** is in fact the leader of one of [[Magnimar]]'s most notorious gangs: the skilled cat burglars known as [[Gargoyles organization|the Gargoyles]]. Although she is no longer able to go on the daring heists for which her gang is renowned, she still directs the Gargoyles from behind the scenes. When direct leadership is needed during a heist, Vammiera entrusts command to her icy-tempered daughter, [[Mizmina Symirkova|Mizmina]].
