> **Pardu Pildapush** is a [[Vudrani]] [[Slavery|slaver]] who owns Pildapush's Chattel on [[Misery Row]], the only street in [[Absalom]] where the buying and selling of sentient beings is legal. Unsurprisingly for a man of his profession, Pardu has few morals and is willing to look the other way for the sake of profit. He is a cautious man who does little without making extensive preparations to deal with any contingencies that might arise from his unpleasant trade. Like his business, Pardu's home is also in the [[Coins]] neighborhood. Pildapush is served by a group of freed [[Halfling|halfling]] slaves who have formed a knife gang called the [[Puddlejumpers]]. Because Pardu himself freed them from bondage and pays them well, they are very loyal to him.
