> [[Karas Novotnian]]'s nephew, **Barenddo Novotnian** founded the town of [[Olfden]] in [[4128 AR]] as the first lumber town in the [[Darkmoon Vale]]. From Olfden, Novotnian lumberjacks bundled together heavy loads of timber (mainly [[Darkwood|darkwood]]) and shipped them south to [[Oregent]]. In Oregent, sawmills owned by Lord Rakesclaw, cut the timber into lengths needed by the shipyards in [[Augustana]]. Once the timber was converted to lumber, it was loaded onto barges and towed to [[Almas]] and distant Augustana.
