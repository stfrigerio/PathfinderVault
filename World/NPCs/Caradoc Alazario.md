> **Caradoc Alazario** was a captain in the [[Chelish Navy]] who became disgusted by how the ruling [[House Thrune]] was treating the citizens of [[Cheliax]] and turned [[Pirate|pirate]].


## Background

> In his new career as the captain of the pirate ship, the *Infernal Reward*, he primarily targeted Chelish merchants and ports, particularly the capital city of [[Egorian]]. This was especially troublesome to his cousin, [[Grachius Alazario]], who is the city's mayor. In order to end the embarrassment to his family name, Mayor Grachius used his connections in the Chelish Navy to hunt down and capture his cousin. Caradoc was finally caught in the [[Sodden Lands]] in [[4710 AR]] after celebrating a fruitful raid on a ship smuggling [[Urgathoa|Urgathoan]] relics (in particular the *[[Defiled Disks of Urgathoa]]*) to [[Absalom]]. After his capture, Caradoc was taken to a secret Chelish redoubt and held there until liberated by agents of the [[Pathfinder Society]].
