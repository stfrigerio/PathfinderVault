## Role in the Campaign

 As the history teacher, Professor Blackthorn can offer quests or research projects that require the players to delve into historical mysteries, uncover hidden artifacts, or investigate forgotten lore. His vast knowledge of Golarion's past can be a valuable resource for the players as they navigate the challenges and uncover the secrets of Promise and its surrounding regions.

### [[The Ghostly Apparitions]]

Given Professor Blackthorn's character, he could pose a significant challenge to the party during their investigation. Here's how: 

**Skepticism**: As a scholar committed to historical accuracy and objective truth, Professor Blackthorn might be skeptical of the party's claims about the ghostly apparitions. He may demand concrete evidence before he's willing to believe that the hauntings are real. He could also challenge the players' interpretations of the evidence, insisting on a rigorous analysis. 

**Gatekeeper**: Professor Blackthorn, as a professor of history and lore, likely has access to archives or information that the players need for their investigation. Given his lawful alignment and commitment to order and structure, he might refuse to allow the players access to these resources without proper authorization or procedure. He might also refuse to share his knowledge or help the players unless they can convince him of the importance and legitimacy of their investigation.

**Arrogance**: His arrogance could lead him to dismiss the party's theories or findings, especially if they contradict his own understanding of the academy's history. He might also look down on the players if they lack formal education or scholarly credentials, making it difficult for them to win his respect or cooperation. 


**Misdirection**: Professor Blackthorn's fascination with the history of Hermea and its founder, Mengkare, might cause him to push the party towards investigating this as a potential cause, despite it having no real connection to the hauntings. This could lead the party on a wild goose chase or cause them to overlook important clues related to the actual source of the hauntings. To overcome these obstacles, the players will need to find ways to satisfy Professor Blackthorn's demands for evidence and rigorous analysis, navigate the academy's bureaucratic procedures, and either win his respect or find ways to work around him. This could lead to interesting role-playing opportunities and challenges.
