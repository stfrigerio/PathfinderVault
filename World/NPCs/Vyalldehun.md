> **Vyalldehun** was a powerful, ancient [[Ice linnorm|ice linnorm]] who lived in the [[Dungeon|dungeons]] below the [[Ice Spire]] in the northern [[Thanelands]] of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. He died over three centuries ago, but many of the dungeon's inhabitants still are associated with it. The nearby [[Vyalldehun River]], located just north of the Ice Spire, is named after the linnorm.
