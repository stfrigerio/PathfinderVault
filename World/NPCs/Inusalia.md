> **Inusalia, the Lady of Wasting Intoxication** is a servant of [[Xegirius Malikar]]; she effectively rules [[Malikar's Keep|Malikars Keep]] on Malikar's behalf alongside the [[Devourer|devourer]] Phericydus. She is valued by Malikar for her supply of a large amount of goods imported to Malikar's Keep, due to her access to other [[Plane|planes]]. She dwells within a drug den whose curious purple door drifts through the keep and can also be seen on [[Abaddon]], the [[Material Plane]], or in [[Galisemni]], cultivating her clients' addiction and eating most of them later. Inusalia is an even more loyal servant of [[Trelmarixian]]. Inusalia offers a standing bounty on [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] seized from other planes, due to her addiction to devouring unique [[Soul|souls]] who experienced profound sensory experiences in their [[Mortality|lives]].
