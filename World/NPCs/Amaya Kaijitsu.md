> **Amaya Kaijitsu** is a beautiful [[Tian human ethnicity|Tian]] woman who spends her days working as a skilled glass blower, but secretly supports the [[Children of Westcrown]]. She downplays her beauty by wearing the plain clothes appropriate to her profession. A long-time resident of [[Westcrown]], Amaya hopes one day to travel to distant [[Varisia]] to visit [[House Kaijitsu|her relatives]] who live in the city of [[Magnimar]] and the nearby town of [[Sandpoint]].


## Relatives

> Born in [[Magnimar]], Amaya is the daughter of [[Lonjiku Kaijitsu]] and a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] noblewoman, the result of her father's illicit affairs during his frequent visits to the city. She has only met her half-sister [[Ameiko Kaijitsu]] twice, yet is second in line to Ameiko for the throne of [[Minkai]]. She shows no signs of knowing that this is so.
