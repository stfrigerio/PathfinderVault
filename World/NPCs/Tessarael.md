> **Tessarael** was a commander of the [[Elf|elven]] force sent from [[Sovyrian]] to battle [[Treerazer]]. Her mind was warped by Treerazer and his allies, causing her to turn against the elves. Banished, she sought her own way to return to Sovyrian and execute [[Treerazer]]'s secret plan. With the assistance of warped monsters and [[Construct|constructs]], she built a tower along the [[Marideth River]] in [[2693 AR]] for her experiments. The [[Arcane engine|arcane engine]] she constructed did send her through [[Space travel|space]], but she never arrived on Sovyrian. Her current location or whether she still lives is unknown.
> A rock outside of the northeast section of [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Forests/Fangwood]]'s tower wall has Tessarael's [[Rune|rune]], comprised of four overlapping circles, carved into it.
