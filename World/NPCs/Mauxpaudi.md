> **Prince of Feyfrost Mauxpaudi** is the [[Redcap|redcap]] ruler of the [[Irrisen]] province of [[Feyfrost]], the region given to the cold fey in perpetuity after they assisted [[Baba Yaga]] during the [[Winter War]]. Mauxpaudi went insane long ago, but since all rulers of Feyfrost hold their position for 500 year terms, he is still in office. Realizing that even a province populated by [[Fey|fey]] needs a competent leader, [[Chillblight|Chillblights]] city council took over almost all authority, leaving Mauxpaudi with only one task: passing judgement on those accused of breaking provincial laws. Regardless of the evidence presented, however, the redcap only hands down a single sentence: guilty. All those convicted are taken to the Frozen Field to face the Royal Axewielder, Nastusia of the Edge.
