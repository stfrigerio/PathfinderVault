> **Daidian Ruel** became the original [[Hellknights|Hellknight]] when he publicly renounced [[Aroden]] and organized a group of soldiers and friends to avenge [[White Plague]]-related deaths of his wife and [[Eris Ruel|son]] in [[Westcrown]] in [[4575 AR]].



## Background


### The White Plague

> Ruel's wife Lileia Ruel was murdered in [[Pharast]] of 4575 AR near the [[Miratanza]] market in Westcrown, and her death was publicly linked to the [[Path of Grace]], a cult of false Arodenites who worshiped the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Sifkesh]]. His son Eris committed suicide by [[Pesh|pesh]] overdose under the cult's influence soon after in the month of [[Lamashan]].
> Ruel was blocked by members of Westcrown's government, some of whom were hidden cultists of the Path of Grace, from pursuing those guilty of his family's killings. In response, he renounced his own faith in Aroden, formed a group of vigilantes, and began hunting down and capturing the cult's members.
> The cultists Ruel's group captured were soon released, however, thanks to their powerful allies, and Ruel and his vigilantes resorted to beating and killing the cultists against the [[Westcrown Dottari|Westcrown Dottaris]] objections (but to the public's approval). Six of his group were arrested in [[Desnus]] of [[4576 AR]], and Ruel himself was jailed during [[Sarenith]] of 4576 AR.
> Within hours, his posse had broken him out of prison—against his own orders—and fled to [[Fort Rivad]], then a [[Taldor|Taldan]] ruin. He subsequently returned to the city and gave an [[Merciless speech|impassioned speech]] before [[Gaspodar|King Gaspodar]] of [[Cheliax]], who then pardoned him and commissioned him to form a new [[Knight|knightly]] order.


### Founding of the Hellknights

 
 [[Citadel Rivad]], headquarters of the [[Hellknights]] under Daidian Ruel.
> By Sarenith of [[4577 AR]], Ruel's order defeated the Path of Grace and a grateful King Gaspodar gave Fort Rivad to be the knights' permanent home and authorized its restoration into Citadel Rivad, which was completed in [[Neth]] of [[4580 AR]]. Ruel's public and repeated rejection of Aroden led the [[Deity|gods]] followers to dub the group "Hellknights", a denigration that Ruel defiantly adopted.
> Ruel's discovery of senior cult member Misirnis Taranik's woodblock [[Printing press|printing press]] in the ruins of [[Taranik House]], which Ruel burned to the ground along with Taranik in 4577 AR, inspired and helped spread his doctrine of "low philosophy" that would become fundamental to the [[Order of the Rack|Order of the Racks]] creation decades later and its continued interest in maintaining and publishing an "official" Chelish history.


### Disappearance and post-mortal life

> In [[Kuthona]] of [[4581 AR]], Ruel determined that his son Eris's [[Soul|soul]] was in [[Avernus]], [[Hell]]'s topmost layer. He became obsessed with [[Damnation|damnation]] and [[Devil|devils]], and recruited his ally [[Sheel Leroung]] to help him [[Summon|summon]] and interrogate devils. While successful—and learning enough of Hell's legions to incorporate their practices into the nascent Hellknights—Ruel was also corrupted by a [[Gelugon|gelugon]] named [[Voulgarghas]].
> In [[Calistril]] of [[4589 AR]], the library of Citadel Rivad caught fire and Sheel Leroung's top apprentice was found dead. Ruel disappeared that night, never to be seen on [[Golarion]] again, to wander Hell's metropolis of [[Dis]] in an endless search for his son's damned [[Soul|soul]]. Having eventually shed his [[Mortal|mortal]] body, Ruel still searches Dis with occasional aid from Leroung, who became a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] upon his own death.
> The Order of the Rack, officially instated in [[4638 AR]] and based in Citadel Rivad, continues Ruel's mission to destroy wasteful knowledge and indolent idealism before it can affect the simplicity of everyday life. They usually do so via book burnings and the suppression of rebellious groups.
> The Hellknights remain ignorant of Daidian's fate, and while many [[World/Culture/Titles & Kings/Hellknight signifer|Hellknight signifers]] summon Voulgarghas out of the accurate belief that the [[Ice devil|ice devil]] knows Ruel's fate, Voulgarghas has continued to keep it secret.
