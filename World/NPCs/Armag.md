> **Armag** was a [[Kellid]] warlord who ruled the [[Tiger Lords]] tribe a millennium before the [[Absalom Reckoning|founding of Absalom]]. He led the Tiger Lords on a warpath from the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], through [[Numeria]], and into [[Casmaron]].


## Background

> Armag's martial success drew the favor of the war [[Deity|god]] [[Gorum]], and his boasts that death could never claim him drew the ire of the death goddess [[Pharasma]]. Armag soon became a pawn in a dispute between the two deities, and as Pharasma sent [[Aeon|aeons]] to support Armag's enemies, Gorum debated Pharasma over rights to his immortal [[Soul|soul]].
> When Armag was finally slain, Gorum fused Armag's soul into his [[Sword|sword]] *[[Nethys/Artifacts/Ovinrbaane]]* to fulfill the warlord's promise—with his soul trapped in the magic weapon, Armag would never face Pharasma in the [[Boneyard]].
> Gorum then instructed the Tiger Lord [[Shaman|shaman]] Zorek to build a grand tomb in Armag's honor and installed Zorek as its divine guardian, with the intention of preventing Pharasma from ever claiming Armag's soul.


## Possessions

> Armag's sword *Ovinrbaane* was sealed in his tomb but is reportedly now wielded by the Tiger Lords's current leader, [[Armag the Twice-Born]], who claims to be the prophesied second coming of the ancient warlord.
