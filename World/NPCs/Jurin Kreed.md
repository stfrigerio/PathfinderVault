> **Jurin Kreed** is the only son of [[Thuldrin Kreed]], ruthless Gavel of [[Lumber Consortium]] in the town of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] in [[Andoran]]. The child resembles his mother, who died under dubious circumstances just after his birth. He is slim and bookish and Thuldrin has serious difficulties to raise him as a proper [[Kreed family|Kreed]]. With his father, he is one of the last two surviving descendants of the founding families of Falcon's Hollow.
