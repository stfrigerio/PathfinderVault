> **Goren Andosalu** was a painter who lived in the [[Keystone]] district of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]]. An artist of some repute, his most famous works include *Andosalu's Model*, *Midnight Sunrise*, and *[[Throwdown in Swynetown]]*. He supposedly went mad in [[4701 AR]] and set fire to his studio. The ensuing blaze burnt down a number of buildings (including the meeting house of the [[Varisian Council]]) and killed over four dozen people. Andosalu fled the blaze and has not been seen since. Due to his intense notoriety, his paintings have only increased in value.
