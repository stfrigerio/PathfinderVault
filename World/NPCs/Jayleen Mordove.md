> **Jayleen "Morning Dove" Mordove** runs one of the [[Lowcleft|Lowclefts]]—and therefore [[Magnimar|Magnimars]]—most infamous night spots: the [[Gilded Cage]]. Jayleen is renowned as an ex primma donna of the more upmarket [[Triodea]] in the [[Naos]] district. Despite her change from high class performer to the owner of an infamous night spot Jayleen still maintains many contacts within the city's artistic elite.
