> Matron **Astranovidova Parastric** is head of the most reviled of the twelve [[Drow|drow]] noble houses, [[House Parastric]], worshippers of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of alchemy, [[Haagenti]]. Despite being secretly shunned, the horrible [[FleshwarpingFleshwarps|fleshwarped]] creations of her house make Parastric a very powerful force within the drow power structure and give its matron an enormous amount of influence. Despite the [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]] so prevalent amongst her house, Astranovidova is renowned as an unnaturally beautiful drow. She is rarely seen without her [[Drider|drider]] daughter, [[Mardeis Parastric|Mardeis]], accompanying her.
