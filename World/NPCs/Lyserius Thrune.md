> **Lyserius Thrune** was a wealthy noble in [[Corentyn]] who noticed the young captain [[Arronax Endymion]] and sponsored his ascension to admiralty. During the time Admiral Endymion was chasing the enemies of [[House Thrune]] in command of the Fourth Chelish Fleet, Lyserius Thrune fell into a sordid and very public affair with Arronax's beautiful wife [[Adelise]]. When Arromax learned of the affair he went straight to Lyserius and demanded a duel. Lyserius just ordered a guard to shoot him and had him thrown out of Lyserius' court. Arronax retaliated by plundering Lyserius' shipping houses and burning them to the ground. He then fled past the [[Arch of Aroden]] in his flagship *[[Tyrannous]]*. Six more ships crewed by mutineers who had sworn their personal fealty to him years ago accompanied him.
