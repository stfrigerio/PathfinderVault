> **Padishah Emperor Adalan IV** ruled the mighty [[Kelesh]] empire in distant [[Casmaron]] during the last years of the [[Age of Destiny]]. Although he did not order the [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]] invasion of [[Qadira]], he did approve the conquest after it was finished. This led to his installing [[Cerush]] as the first satrap of Qadira in [[-43 AR]].
