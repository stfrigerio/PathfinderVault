> **Scion Lord Goodman Hugen** is the leader of [[Houses of AbsalomHouse Candren|House Candren]] in [[Absalom]], with strong [[Andoran]] sympathies. He is a member of the [[Grand Council]], First Harbormaster, and the proprietor of the [[Sea King Shipyard]]. While he outwardly presents loyalty to [[Lord Gyr]], he secretly abhors positions of nobility and privilege. By appointing Andoran agents to positions of power, he hopes one day to incite a popular revolt and return power to the common folk.
