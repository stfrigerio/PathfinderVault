> **Chief Rothgar** rules the town of [[Aaramor]] as its tribal overlord. He is loyal to the [[Black Sovereign]] but faces great stress from defending his town—and by extension, [[Numeria]]—from the [[Demon|demonic]] [[Worldwound]], balancing the relationship between the townsfolk and the [[Blades of Aaramor]], and the fiscal demands of the [[Technic League]].
