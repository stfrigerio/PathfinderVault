> **Count Olomon Venacdahlia** ruled the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Ardeal]] around the time that [[Ardis]] was demoted as the capital city of the nation of Ustalav: Ardeal was superseded by the [[Caliphas city|city of Caliphas]]. However, he is most famous as being Ardeal's ruler at the time of the [[War Without Rivals]].


## Family

> The count is a member of the [[House Venacdahlia]], the noble family who rule the county of Ardeal. In his younger days, the count was smitten by the actress [[Solismina Croscamille]] whom he married in [[4648 AR]] making her [[Solismina Venacdahlia|Countess Solismina Venacdahlia]]. They had four children, all girls: [[Lasara Venacdahlia|Lasara]], [[Radania Venacdahlia|Radania]], [[Opaline Venacdahlia|Opaline]], and [[Floriama Venacdahlia|Floriama]].


## War Without Rivals

> In [[4687 AR]] relations between Venacdahlia's Ardeal and the neighbouring county of [[Barstoi]] broke down when [[Aericnein Neska|Count Aericnein Neska]] invaded Ardeal to seize [[Furcina]] and started the civil war known as the War Without Rivals. In [[4689 AR]], Venacdahlia gathered an army to reclaim Furcina. After four years of trench warfare and politicking in Caliphas, in [[4693 AR]], Neska was forced to admit defeat and retreated from Furcina. Venacdahlia's victory celebrations were short, however, as Neska utterly destroyed the land as his troops fell back. Today, the land is now known as [[The Furrows|the Furrows]]: it is a haunted wasteland.
