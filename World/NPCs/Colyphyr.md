> **Colyphyr** was a [[Demon lord|demon lord]] who was killed by [[Nocticula]]. The demon lord's corpse formed one of the [[Midnight Isles]] following this demise.


## History

> Colyphyr was first propelled to his status as a demon lord when a [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]] runestone—a fragment of [[Abyss|Abyssal]] essence thrust into the [[Multiverse|multiverse]] when the [[Abyss]] first came into being—fell back into the Abyss from the [[Astral Plane]] and became lodged into her flesh when she was still a [[Nascent demon lord|nascent demon lord]].
> Colyphyr was slain by [[Nocticula]] in [[-6150 AR]], when she was distracted by the assassination of [[Xirie]], the [[Runelords|runelord of sloth]] and one of her most powerful followers, at the hands of Nocticula's follower [[Angothane]]. Her animus subsequently formed [[Colyphyr island|the Midnight Isle of the same name]]. The runestone that originally caused her ascension remained embedded in this island, forming a kind of grave marker for the deceased demon lord.
> During her alterations to the timeline through the *[[Scepter of Ages]]*, Runelord [[Alaznist]] prevented Xirie's death by warning her of the impending attack, and thus created a new timeline where both her demise and Colyphyr's were prevented. In this new history, the demon lord endured into the present day and agreed to aid Alaznist in her takeover of [[Varisia]], taking the city of [[Kaer Maga]] as a personal prize.
