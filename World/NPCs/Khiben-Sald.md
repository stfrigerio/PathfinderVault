> The mighty land of [[Vudra]] in [[Casmaron]] was united by the legendary **Maharajah Khiben-Sald**, from whom the present day maharajah of Vudra traces his descent.


## History

> Khiben-Sald is said to have been a direct descendant of the mighty Vudran kings who slew [[Kothogaz]], one of the terrible [[Spawn of Rovagug]] who ravaged Vudra. He is also known to have slain the jungle princess [[Chhaya]] in her palace.


### Visit to the Inner Sea Region

> In [[563 AR]], Khiben-Sald and his traveling court arrived in a fleet of 101 [[Ship|ships]] at the city of [[Quantium]] in [[Nex]]. This was the first recorded instance of [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]] arriving in the [[Inner Sea region]]. The archmage [[Nex (person)|Nex]] granted Khiben-Sald dominion over the Isle of [[Jalmeray]], and he remained there for ten years before returning to Vudra.
> Neither Khiben-Sald nor Nex asked the island's native [[Human|human]] population's permission when they took over the island. Instead, Khiben-Sald bought them off with [[Magic|magical]] treasures to avoid an armed rebellion. Some of these natives decided to flee to the nearby island of [[Kaina Katakha]], not wishing to become Vudran servants. This decision intrigued the maharajah, who let them continue living there in peace, and considered the island his own personal sanctuary of exotic primitives.
> During his stay, he heavily influenced the culture of the people of the island, built countless temples to Vudran [[Deities|deities]], and called [[Elemental|elemental]] creatures to help transform Jalmeray into a better likeness of his homeland.
> Khiben-Sald is also known to have visited the city of [[Absalom]] during his stay, and it was he who declared it to be the "Great Jewel of the Inner Sea". His visit also triggered a brief Vudran [[Architectural|architectural]] fad; a few of the teardrop domes can still be seen in Absalom to this day.
> At the end of the decade, he left behind numerous glorious monuments (including the [[Pure Temple of the Maharajah]]) and [[Binding outsiders|bound]] [[Genie|genies]].
