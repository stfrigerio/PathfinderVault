> In [[4642 AR]], the [[Pathfinder]] **Brance Yoha** was among the most ambitious veterans of the [[Taldan Imperial Navy]] but his low birth prevented him from climbing the ranks. Disappointed, he resigned his commission and decided to sell his experience to other governments of the [[Inner Sea region]]. Eventually he was sent by [[Absalom]] as the leader of a fleet consisting of seven ships, to fight the [[Pirate|pirates]] of the lawless [[Shackles]]. When Yoha reached the Shackles he found a small island just northeast of [[Devil's Arches|Devils Arches]] whose position was ideal for his base. The island featured plentiful fresh water, game, lumber, and fruit, but also myriad relics depicting gruesome acts of [[Cannibalism|cannibalism]] and it was always considered haunted by the restless horrors of ancient [[Ghol-Gan]]. Yoha ignored his crew's warnings and decided to make the island his base of operations. Yoha and his crew positioned their camp at the base of a ziggurat devoted to a powerful [[Demon|demon]] known to the Ghol-Gan people as [[Moxix|Moxix the Drinker of Human Hopes]]. The statue of Moxix stood at the top of the ziggurat. Yoha and his crew were never heard from again. It is said that the crew went mad, slaying one another and resorting to cannibalism and other acts of depravity defying description. The island is now known as the [[Yoha's Graveyard|Yohas Graveyard]].
