> **Kiriltai Khan** is the current ruler of [[Hongal]], and therefore most of the [[Tian human ethnicity|Tian-La]] people, with many *Baga Bohd*, leaders of the various horse tribes, serving below him. Kiriltai Khan is known for his hunger and his ferocious temper, despite this he is also renowned for his incredible charisma. The people of Hongal claim their khan could talk a [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]] out of its skin. Kiriltai Khan spends almost no time in Hongal's official capital [[Ordu-Aganhei]], instead he and his tribe roam the tundra as the Tian-La have done for millennia.
