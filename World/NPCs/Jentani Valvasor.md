> **Countess Jentani Valvasor** is a powerful [[Moroi|moroi]] [[Vampire|vampire]] stripped from her title and wealth millennia ago for opposing the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]]. She leads a handful of vampires who survived the vampire lord [[Malyas]]'s Blood Drought purge of [[3220 AR]]; they are now returning to their ancestral home in secret. She still lives in fear of the Whispering Tyrant's reprisal even now that she has begun to regain some of the wealth of her early existence.
