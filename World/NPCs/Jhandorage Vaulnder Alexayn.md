> **Jhandorage Vaulnder Alexayn**, also known as **Alexayn the Miser**, was one of the founders of the [[Aspis Consortium]] in [[Cheliax]].


## Background

> He spent the last few years of his life spending much of his considerable wealth creating buildings and monuments in his honor throughout his hometown of [[Ostenso]] on the [[Inner Sea]]. Upon his death he was interred in a gigantic, lavish mausoleum, along with his remaining object d'art. His obsession with being remembered was so great that when his mausoleum was looted 108 years after his death, he rose as a [[Mummy|mummy]] when he discovered that he had been entirely forgotten. He now haunts the streets of Ostenso in the faded fashions of Cheliax from a century ago, plotting on how he will once again raise his reputation, this time by more nefarious means if necessary.
> In [[4652 AR]], Jhandorage Alexayn used a centuries-old directive known as Inter-Branch Directive 1111 to order the organization's most brilliant minds to research radical new ways for business and expansion. He judged [[Conference Z]] such a success that he secretly dedicated a percentage of consortium's yearly profits to backing the think tank.
