aliases: The Evil Entity

---

Zephyrus, the malevolent entity that has corrupted The Luminous Order, is a sinister being intricately tied to Mephistopheles, the Archduke of Hell. 

Zephyrus discovered an ancient tome or artifact hidden within Promise Academy that contained dark rituals and forbidden knowledge directly connected to Mephistopheles' power.

Through these dark rituals, Zephyrus forged a pact with Mephistopheles, granting it access to infernal magic and diabolical influence. The entity uses this newfound power to manipulate the innocent students of The Luminous Order, gradually twisting their intentions and leading them down a nefarious path.

Zephyrus presents itself as an avatar or agent of Mephistopheles, employing illusions, lies, and promises of great knowledge and power to corrupt the minds of The Luminous Order. It feeds on their desires for recognition and intellectual growth, subtly steering them towards darker deeds and ultimately convincing them to steal the artifact from the academy's vault.
