> **Father Vosten**, sometimes **Father Volsten**, built a shrine to [[Sarenrae]] in [[Magnimar]]'s [[Underbridge]] district soon after the city's founding. He felt this permanently shadowed location was perfect to receive the Dawnflower's light. Unfortunately, he and his two acolytes were murdered by a [[Sczarni]] gang for refusing to make protection payments.
