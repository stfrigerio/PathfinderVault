> **Lady Kaltessa Iyis** is the centuries-old high priestess of the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Mammon]] in the [[Inner Sea region]]. She resides in the [[Iron Rose]], a palace in [[Menador Mountains]] of  northeastern [[Isger]].


## Description

> Even though she is hundreds of years old, Iyis appears as a young, [[Chelaxian]] woman due to an infernal pact she made with Mammon. She is never seen without her [[Barbed devil|barbed devil]], [[Velstrac|velstrac]], and [[Imp|imp]] servants, and is known to be pursuing several long-term plans for the region inspired by her infernal master.


## Isger

> Lady Iyis is said to be taking advantage of the lack of a strong Isgeri military presence in the country's hinterlands following the [[Goblinblood Wars]], and creating an army of [[Undead|undead]]. She is also rumored to have taken magical control over much of the nation's leaders.
