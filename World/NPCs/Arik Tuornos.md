> **Arik Tuornos** is a [[Durotas]] (city guard captain) of the [[Westcrown Dottari|rundottari]] or 'ruin wardens' and commander of Keep Dotar in the north east of [[Rego Cader]]. Arik accepted command of the rundottari to prevent a family enemy Eccobar Drumaris from assuming the position. He is a cynic but is a fair and honorable man who leads his men with pride and distinction in one of the most challenging and dangerous sectors of the city.
