> **Sefir Etis** is the [[Garundi human ethnicity|Garundi]] military commander of the city of [[Ipeq]] in southern [[Ancient Osirion]]. Etis is usually occupied with the [[Risen Guard]]'s operations in the region, and is rarely interested in the politics of Ipeq. He is increasingly dissatisfied with the governor, [[Hepater Rephitan]], and the People's Council, whom Etis feels put the needs of the civilians above the needs of the military force stationed in town. He reminds them that the city was once completely dedicated to the military needs.
