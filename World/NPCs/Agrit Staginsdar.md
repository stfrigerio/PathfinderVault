> **Agrit Staginsdar** is the only daughter of a long line of [[Dwarven|dwarven]] warriors who left [[Janderhoff]] and came to the small town of [[Trunau]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]] for unknown reasons. She disappointed her family greatly when after a few years of studying the art of war, she insisted on turning her studies to [[Magic|arcane magic]]. Agrit is a councilor and also the owner of the [[House of Wonders]] in Trunau, a fine business which provides spellcasting services and magic items. Agrit is married to [[Sara Morninghawk]] and this childless marriage has ended the Staginsdar line.
