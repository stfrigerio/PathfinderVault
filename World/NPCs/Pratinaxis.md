> **Pratinaxis** is a ancient [[Silver dragon|silver dragon]] who resides within [[Citadel Cardekriel]] on the [[Plane of Air|Elemental Plane of Air]]. Pratinaxis serves as the commander of a [[Knight|knightly order]] of silver dragons who guard Citadel Cardekriel and the holy relics of the [[Deity|god]] [[Apsu]] that are kept within it. Pratinaxis and his draconic knights are kept under almost constant attack by an army of [[White dragon|white dragons]] who seek a set of ancient [[Artifact|artifacts]] known as the *[[Shastiled]]* that they believe are kept hidden within Citadel Cardekriel. This white dragon army is led by the ancient dragon [[Shelsikarsis]] who is always scheming to infiltrate the citadel despite Pratinaxis's best efforts to prevent this.
