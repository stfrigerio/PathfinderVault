> **Kaltia** is a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]] that haunts the hill near the [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] settlement of [[Hallein Town]]. There she menaces the salt porters who transport the precious mineral from the salt mines of [[Virlych]] to Lastwall. It is said that she was slain by her own clan when she attempted to make peace with the [[Orc|orcs]]. Even though she has been destroyed numerous times by [[Knight|crusader knights]], she always returns, and is especially active during the winter months.
