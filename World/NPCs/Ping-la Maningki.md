> **Ping-la Maningki** serves as the commander of [[Fort Kragang]], a [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]] fortress built by [[Kaoling]] within the borders of the neighbouring kingdom of [[Zi Ha]]. During the last invasion by [[Tsung-cha Kavangaki|Warlord Tsung-cha Kavangaki]], the hobgoblins pushed further into Zi Ha than ever before. They constructed Fort Kragang at the furthest point of conquest and appointed Ping-la as its commander. Since then, however, Ping-la has received very little support and, having grown tired of the lack of supplies, she has started organising raids into the surrounding mountains.
