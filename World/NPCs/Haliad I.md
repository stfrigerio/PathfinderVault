> **Prince Haliad I** was a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] monarch of the 42nd century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]], who despite his complicated history is still remembered in Cheliax today.


## History

> He led an unsuccessful siege on [[Absalom]] in [[4137 AR]], but had more success in [[Garund]] the same year when he conquered [[Khari]] and gave Cheliax control over both sides of the [[Arch of Aroden]] for the first time. This conquest gave Cheliax naval dominance in their part of the [[Inner Sea region]] that has continued to the present. Haliad continued his territorial expansion in Garund the [[4138 AR|following year]] and founded a new colony. Haliad visited the newly established colony in [[4142 AR]] but misunderstood the name the colonists had given it, and instead named it [[Sargava]] after his favorite horse.


## Memorials

> A prominent statue of Haliad I surrounded by a colossal fountain stands in [[Egorian|Egorians]] Sargavan Plaza, and the district of [[New Haliad]] in the Sargavan capital of [[Anthusis|Eleder]] is named after him.
