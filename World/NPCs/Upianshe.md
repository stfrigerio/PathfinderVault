> **Upianshe** is a [[Ninshabur|Ninshaburian]] explorer who first discovered and named the [[Flying polyp|flying polyp]] city Neruzavin. She was later killed by her friends, who were infected by [[Xhamen-Dor]], and haunts the city as a [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]].


## History

> Upianshe was born in the final decades of Ninshabur's existence and grew up on a caravan that travelled annually across the great cities of the empire. For three years she noticed strange signs in three of the cities and recorded everything she learned and suspected.
> She finally submitted a report of what she had learned to the guards of the city Teralindar, which suggested that a subterranean mastermind was manipulating the markets for sinister purposes. The guards dismissed her, but Upianshe was unfazed; she stole her mother's [[Sword|sword]] and descended into the city's underground tunnels. Four days later she dragged a [[Dark naga|dark naga]]'s corpse to the surface, proving that her suspicions had been correct.
> The authorities rewarded Upianshe by [[Mechanics/Spells/Spells/Level 1/Magic Weapon|enchanting]] her sword, which became known as *Teralindar's Honor*, in order to help her combat other such threats to the empire. In return, she continued to critically examine Ninshabur's oldest assumptions and superstitions, especially those close to home.
> To disprove wild stories about the forbidding [[Parchlands]], she led an expedition of academics into the desert. There they discovered the ruins of a city on the bank of a crater lake, and Upianshe named it Neruzavin—"Cradle of Heaven". Her team set up camp at the *[[Star Stela]]* of Alar and began to explore the ruins, but quickly fell victim to terrible nightmares.
> Upianshe initially dismissed these phenomenal nightmares since she herself was not affected, but as her colleagues progressively lost their grip on reality, she eventually discovered the [[Great Old One]] Xhamen-Dor beneath the lake. It was too late: her entire team was seeded, and they tore her apart. Her ghost continues to haunt the ruins, re-examining her findings, second-guessing her conclusions, and blaming herself for not sensing Xhamen-Dor sooner.
