> [[Arbiters Korvosa|Senior Arbiter]] **Zenobia "Zena" Zenderholm**, of [[House Zenderholm]], is also known as the "Hanging Judge" of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]]. She acquired this nickname from her strict, no-nonsense court rulings, and is justifiably feared among the city's criminal elements. Despite her reputation, she deals light sentences to criminals of desperation and is renowned for her aid to victims of crime outside of the courts.
> After sentencing Maloda Cadabrani, the daughter of the well-known [[Sczarni]] boss Fummos Cadabrani, to death by hanging, she was sent a starved [[Swamp barracuda|swamp barracuda]] as a warning. The arbiter escaped with her life, but has hired a food taster to protect her since then.
> She is also a popular philanthropist in Korvosa, volunteering free legal advice to [[Cleric|clerics]] and Korvosa's orphanages as part of her service to [[Abadar]].
> Zenobia was one of the first victims of the [[Diseases of Golarion|blood veil plague]]. As her attempts to remove the [[Disease|disease]] from herself failed, she lost her faith in Abadar and started praying to [[Urgathoa]], pledging her service if she were to be freed of her torment. Her wish was granted when Urgathoa transformed her into a [[Penanggalen|penanggalen]]. As she continued to masquerade as a living [[Human|human]], Zenobia handed the [[Longacre Building]] to the [[Gray Maidens]] and pledged her allegiance to [[Ileosa Arabasti|Queen Ileosa]].
