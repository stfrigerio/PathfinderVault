> The leader of a gang of [[Wererat|wererats]] that patrol the [[Rotgut District]] of [[Riddleport]], **Ziphras** is the weakest of the city's crimelords. His unique gang scurry about the district in [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Rat|rat]] form gathering news, information, targets, and new recruits (both willing and unwilling) for his gang. Because of his [[Lycanthropic|lycanthropic]] traits and shady methods, Ziphras has proven a difficult opponent to those who would face him, as proven by his status as a crimelord.


## Relatives

> Ziphras was born to [[Sczarni]] wererats in Riddleport, and is the last surviving member of that clan to remain in Riddleport. His relative Ayala Javeski founded the criminal [[Tower Girls]] gang of [[Magnimar]].
