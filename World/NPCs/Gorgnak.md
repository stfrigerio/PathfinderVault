> **Gorgnak** is a [[Hill giant|hill giant]] war chief in the island of [[Flintyreach]] in the Linnorm Kingdom of the [[Ironbound Islands]]. The hill giants, [[Ettin|ettins]] and [[Troll|trolls]] who live in the mountains of the island's interior are the greatest threat to the [[Half-orc|half-orc]] community of [[Averaka]]. The giants are organized in independent clans or under the sway of the war chief Gorgnak. The half-orcs of Averaka fight the giants fiercely and welcome anyone who shares their hatred of them. The Averaka giant slayers have dedicated themselves to the eradication of their monstrous neighbors.
> The charismatic chieftain Gorgnak rules the fortress of [[Thunderhold]], leading a semi-loyal band of hill giant, ettin, and troll warriors.
