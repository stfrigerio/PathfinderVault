> **Messentrel the Purple** is a [[Crystal dragon|crystal dragon]] who rules an "empire" of linked caverns on the elemental [[Plane of Earth]]. In common with most crystal dragons, he is incredibly vain about his crystalline scales (of flawless amethyst, in his case) but his subjects live relatively comfortable lives due to his protection.
> He also holds sway over several nearby realms of [[Earth mephit|earth mephits]] and [[Dwarf|dwarves]], by virtue of his [[Half-dragon|half-dragon]] children who serve as their rulers. One of his more recent acquisitions as a vassal state is the Voracious Domain of the Jeweled Demigod Empress Althrana, the most notable of the earth and [[Salt mephit|salt mephit]] settlements on the [[Plane|plane]].
