> After her retirement from the Andoren Navy, **Admiral Carillia Weathers** asked to head the newly formed [[Office of Privateering Actions]], a division of the Andoren Navy that grants [[Letter of marque|letters of marque]] to privateers and tracks their actions. She gladly accepted the job, and her great experience makes her ideal for the position. [[Andoren privateers]] were officially sanctioned in [[4709 AR]], and their home port is [[Augustana]].
