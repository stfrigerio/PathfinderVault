> **[[Lictor]] Uro Adom** is the [[Osirion|Osirion-born]] head of the [[Order of the Chain]], a [[Hellknights]] order based near the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Corentyn]]. For the past decade, he has been negotiating with the governments of Cheliax, [[Nidal]], [[Taldor]], [[Rahadoum]], and even [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], offering to house the [[Inner Sea region|Inner Sea regions]] most notorious criminals in the Order's prison-headquarters, [[Citadel Gheradesca]]. In return, the Order receives hefty annual tithes from those nations. The Order's [[Master of Blades]], [[Mardinus]], is a former [[Slavery|slave]] of Adom's, showing how far one can rise within the organization by obeying the social order.
