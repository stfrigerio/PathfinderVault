> One of the two [[Venture-captain|venture-captains]] who founded the [[Heidmarch Manor|Pathfinder lodge in Magnimar]], **Sheila Heidmarch** is a seasoned but now retired [[Adventurer|adventurer]]. Sheila and her husband (and lifelong adventuring partner) [[Canayven Heidmarch]] acquired their private estate in [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] [[Naos]] district after retiring from a life of adventuring. Seeing value in their homeland, Sheila and Canayven have established the first [[Pathfinder Society]] [[Pathfinder lodge|lodge]] in [[Varisia]], granting the Society access to the relatively unexplored wilderness region rich with ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] artifacts ripe for the plunder.


## Background

> Sheila was born of a [[Thuvia|Thuvian]] merchant and [[Cheliax|Chelish]] aristocrat in the Varisian city-state of [[Korvosa]]. She met her future husband at a distant relative's ball in [[Cheliax]] and was immediately enamoured and intrigued by the older and more experienced [[Pathfinder]]. Disappointed that the Pathfinder Society had no presence in her native homeland, she connived to have her father send her to [[Absalom]], where she became an initiate at the [[Grand Lodge]].
> Even though she longed to return to Varisia and explore its many ruins, the Society was primarily focused on central [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]] at the time. She bided her time and took on other expeditions, travelling to her father's homeland of Thuvia, where she investigated the ruins of Jah in the [[Barrier Wall|Barrier Wall mountains]]. During these travels, she found an [[Awakened|awakened]] [[Gorilla|mountain gorilla]] who became her guardian, and re-encountered Canayven, whom she married shortly thereafter.
> Both the Heidmarches longed to return to Varisia, but the Society considered it a vast wilderness of little interest filled with nothing but [[Goblin|goblins]] and [[Giant|giants]]. Taking matters into her own hands, Sheila petitioned the [[Decemvirate]] to open a new Pathfinder lodge in Magnimar and was soon accorded the honor. She has since spent her time reacquainting herself with her homeland and uncovering its countless secrets, becoming an expert in Thassilonian lore in the process.
