> **Faithful Daughter** is a [[Jackalwere|jackalwere]] priestess of the [[Demon|demon-goddess]] [[Lamashtu]], frequently found in humanoid form in the marketplaces of the city of [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]]. She dresses in tattered, brown robes that are always slashed above the abdomen, revealing a mass of brutal scars. Faithful Daughter is always veiled, and her true appearance is a matter of some debate among those who frequent the suqs of the city. Some believe she has a horribly disfigured face, some that she is beautiful, while others speculate that she wears a [[Jackal|jackals]] face, no matter her form. The priestess does not openly proselytize, but will make herself available seeking information about the Mother of Monsters.
