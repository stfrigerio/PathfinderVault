> **Valdis** is a [[Rusalka|rusalka]] [[Witch|witch]] who is the [[Fey|fey]] ruler of the [[Ironbound Islands|Ironbound Island]] of [[Dragon's Rib|Dragons Rib]]. Valdis prefers to keep herself hidden and her very existence a secret to all but a select few. Her lair is a cave system hidden along the banks of the [[Black Tarn]] mountain lake. The ancient [[Water orm|water orm]] Blackfin and the [[Draugr|draugr]] [[Arnlaugr|Arnlaugr the Fearless]] serve both as lures for victims and Valdis' guardians.
> Arnlaugr was killed by Valdis and turned into a draugr [[Undead|undead]] when the [[Ulfen]] hero tried to add Blackfin's head into his trophy collection.
