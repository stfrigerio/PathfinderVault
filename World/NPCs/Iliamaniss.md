> The [[Elf|elven]] [[Vampire|vampire]] **Iliamaniss** has spent the last century trying to find a way past the *[[Great Seal]]* beneath the tower of [[Gallowspire]] in [[Ustalav]]. A faithful servant of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] and a former Grandmaster Conspiratorial of the [[Seal-Breakers]] who stepped down a hundred years ago to focus on her job, she controls several rooms in the dungeons outside of the *Great Seal*, where she works tirelessly with her [[Undead|undead]] and [[Elemental|elemental]] minions to free her master, and feels that a breakthough is near.
