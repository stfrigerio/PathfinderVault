> **Xegirius Malikar** is a mad [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] who dwells within a castle on the [[Negative Energy Plane]] known as [[Malikar's Keep|Malikars Keep]]. He leaves most of the day-to-day rule of the keep's population to his minions [[Inusalia]] and Phericydus, preferring to spend time in his tower exploring other realities and recording his discoveries. Sadistic and pragmatic at the same time, he understands the use of a population depending on him for survival, and expects all residents of Malikar's Keep to provide services or items.
