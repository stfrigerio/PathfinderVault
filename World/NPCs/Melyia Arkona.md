> **Vimanda** is a member of [[House Arkona]], one of the most powerful noble families in [[Korvosa]]. Publicly known as **Melyia Arkona**, she is in truth a powerful [[Raja rakshasa|raja rakshasa]] taking the guise of a [[Human|human]].



## Appearance

> Although she can take any human form, Vimanda's preferred form is that of an attractive [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]] woman.


## Background

> Vimanda was born to the raja rakshasa couple [[Mapras]] and Dandra. Her parents were originally from [[Vudra]], and settled in Korvosa after murdering and stealing the identities of the original human members of House Arkona when they came to Vudra. In [[4704 AR]], Vimanda and her brother [[Bahor]] murdered their parents and took over their leadership of House Arkona.
> Vimanda, as second behind Bahor in command of House Arkona, quietly plots to displace her brother. In her public ruse as Melyia, she plays the role of cousin and lover to her brother's guise, Glorio Arkona; in private, her and Bahor grow more at odds with each other.


## Associates

> Vimanda and her brother work alongside several other rakshasas from Vudra who wish to see their grand experiment in Korvosa succeed. They are served by [[Magic|magically]] controlled human servants who know them only as mundane mob bosses.
> Vimanda keeps [[Verik Vancaskerkin]] as a lover, and has fueled his ascent through the ranks of the [[Korvosan Guard]].
