> The [[Black dragon|black dragon]] **Seryzilian** is one of the most well-known members of his species in all of [[Avistan]].  He makes his home in the small swamp north of the town of [[Karcau]] in [[Ustalav]].  From there he attacks the local countryside but never reveals his identity, preferring to strike terror from secret.  Locals assume that the deaths and cattle mutilations must be the work of [[Undead|undead]], not believing that a living creature could work without revealing himself.  The [[Dragon|dragon]] is aware of a darker force that inhabits his swamp, but so far been unable to contact it.
