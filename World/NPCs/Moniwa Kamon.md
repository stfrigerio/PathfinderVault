> **Moniwa Kamon** is the current governor of [[Akafuto Province]] in the kingdom of [[Minkai]]. Kamon is a member of the [[Moniwa family]] who have ruled Akafuto Province for over a millennia, ensuring remarkable political stability for the region. Kamon, however, has garnered some disfavour amongst his own people as he was quick to support the [[Soto Takahiro|Jade Regent]] when he claimed the Jade Throne.
