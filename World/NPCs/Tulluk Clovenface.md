> **Tulluk Clovenface** is the leader of the [[Haskodar tribe]] of [[Orc|orcs]] that shares [[Blisterwell]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]] with the [[One Eye tribe]]. There is deep hatred between Tulluk and [[Molkk Dwarf-Mangler]], the leader of the One Eye tribe. Tulluk and his clan do not originate from the Hold of Belkzen: they are actually [[Darklands]] orcs. They first emerged onto the surface in [[4701 AR]] in a surprise attack that allowed them to gain control of three of the seven mine shafts that make up the city of Blisterwell. 
> Tulluk Clovenface has led the Haskodar tribe since before they invaded the surface. Originally, they dwelt in [[Nar-Voth]] where they fought with the [[Duergar|duergar]] of [[Fellstrok]]. This incessant warring final ended when [[Brithuan|War Marshal Brithuan]] offered Tulluk a permanent truce. The duergar offered [[Weapon|weapons]] and [[Slaves|slaves]] to the Haskodar in exchange for them attacking and conquering the surface city of Blisterwell. Unbeknownst to Tulluk, cunning War Marshal Brithuan plans to then use the city as a beachhead to topple [[Grask Uldeth]] who controls [[Urgir]], hoping to install an orc leader that is in his debt and use them to help him expand his Fellstrok-based slave trade.
