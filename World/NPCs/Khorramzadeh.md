> The powerful [[Balor|balor]] [[Demon|demon]] **Khorramzadeh** rules the city of [[Iz]] in the [[Worldwound]]. He is known as the Storm King, as his form is bathed in lightning rather than the fire usual to balors.
> He is one of the two most powerful of the Worldwound's many warlords—the other is the [[Marilith|marilith]] [[Zuhra Aponavicius]]. His notoriety has risen in recent years, since his forces managed to destroy one of the *[[Wardstone|wardstones]]* that keep the demons out of [[Mendev]], enabling demonic forces to enter Mendev for the first time in a generation. The attack ultimately failed, but the leaders of Mendev are worried that the Storm King's gain in prestige may enable him to unite a sizeable part of the Worldwound's demonic hordes against them. Their response to this threat was to call the [[Mendevian Crusades#Fourth Mendevian Crusade (4692 AR – 4707 AR)|Fourth Mendevian Crusade]].
