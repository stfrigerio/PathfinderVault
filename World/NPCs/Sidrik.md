> **Sidrik** was the son of the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] hero and king [[Khadon|Khadon the Mighty]], founder of the empire of [[Tar Khadurrm]]. As a Crown Prince, Sidrik met with delegates from [[Isger]] and [[Cheliax]] in [[3450 AR]]. Sidrik was crowned king of Tar Khadurrm after his father's death from old age in [[3451 AR]]. He founded [[Raseri Kanton]] at the request of the nations of Cheliax and Isger. The new city was a surface city close to mighty [[Jernashall]], founded in [[3312 AR]] by his father. Raseri Kanton became an important trade center between Tar Khadurrm and the two human nations. In [[3495 AR]] King Sidrik moved the capital of Tar Khadurrm from [[Highhelm Militia]] to Jernashall.
