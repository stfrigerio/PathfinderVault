> **Blue Jarl** is a huge, powerfully muscled [[Ice troll|ice troll]] with a giant battleaxe carved from magical ice. He is the ruler of [[Ysborg]], the 'Steading of the Ice Trolls', at the far south-eastern corner of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Southmoor]].
> The Blue Jarl's "[[Winter Palace]]" is one of of Ysborg's few stone buildings. It is nothing more than a blocky pile of icy rocks but it is well-fortified. The throne of the Blue Jarl is made from carved [[Mammoth|mammoth]] tusks and is decorated with [[Human|human]] skulls. The Blue Jarl's kennels, just outside the palace are filled with [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]] who have sworn allegiance to the jarl and the Bear Pits host ferocious [[Polar bear|polar]] and [[Grizzly bear|grizzly bears]] armored and trained to fight.
> Ice trolls, [[Ettin|ettins]], [[Ogre|ogres]], and other [[Giant|giants]] come from all across the Linnorm Kingdoms to join the army of the Blue Jarl. It is said that Blue Jarl is a fugitive from the [[Frost giant|frost giant]] citadel of [[Holvirgang]] in northern [[Irrisen]], but the Blue Jarl himself claims to be the son of the frost giant deity [[Thremyr]]. He is always accompanied by his loyal frost giant shield maidens, as well as by the huge, white-furred [[Dire bear|dire bear]] that serves as his mount.
> Rumors hold that Irrisen has been courting Ysborg as an ally, but so far, the trolls remain independent.
