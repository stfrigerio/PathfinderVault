> **Caedaynenlo** was one of the two leaders of the [[Shroud of Unicorns]] in the [[Worldwound]]. Caedaynenlo's twin, [[Alunelsheas]], was co-leader, but neither has been seen for several years. Few [[Unicorn|unicorns]] remained toward the end of the [[Demon|demonic]] occupation to fight against them. Since the closing of the Worldwound at the end of the [[Fifth Mendevian Crusade]] in [[4718 AR]], their current fate remains unknown.
