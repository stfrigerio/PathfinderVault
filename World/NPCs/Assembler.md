> The **Assembler** is the mysterious proprietor of the [[Clockwork Cathedral]] in [[Absalom]].



## Appearance

> The Assembler is a gaunt figure who speaks in a mechanical monotone, moves with deliberate gestures, and wears a robe and voluminous hood.


## Associates

> Since its arrival in Absalom, the Assembler has never left the Clockwork Cathedral. Only the administrators and the most promising students are allowed an audience with it in the Cathedral's deepest chambers. Most students, who never meet the Assembler, speak of its brilliance and its complicated, decades-long, enigmatic schemes. A few of Absalom's rulers, including [[Gyr of House Gixx]] and his predecessor, have privately met with the Assembler, while [[Wynsal Starborn]] seeks to learn more about its motives before entering its lair.


## Background

> In [[4637 AR]], after a fire consumed Absalom's old temple of [[Asmodeus]], an enormous [[Iron|iron]] [[Ship|ship]] arrived in the harbour. The Assembler, apparently its only passenger, emerged, sought out the authorities, and purchased the site of the burnt temple. After a month, the ship was [[Magic|magically]] transported there and turned into the Clockwork Cathedral.
