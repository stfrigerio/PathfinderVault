*For another meaning of "Lonely Maiden", please see Lonely Maiden (yuki-onna).*
> The **Lonely Maiden** is a [[Medusa|medusa]] that walks among the statues of the dreaded [[Field of Maidens]] south of [[Geb's Rest]]. She is of mysterious origin, and rumors of her existence have subsisted across centuries. Adventurers who return from expeditions in the fields testify that the medusa is as real as death itself.
