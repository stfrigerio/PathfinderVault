> Vyron "Shank" Jethezme grew up as a [[Sczarni]] thug in the city of [[Sandpoint]]. After getting into a fight with his sister's lover in a back-ally, he stabbed him to death. This forced him to run from the law, and he escaped to a unnamed forest (which subsequently gained his name, [[Shank's Wood|Shanks Wood]], because of this) an hour's walk east of town. He built a shack, the Shankshack, in the woods and made a living ambushing travelers for 3 years. This continued until he attacked a disguised [[Faceless stalker|faceless stalker]]. This stalker, named Varuuzus, killed him, backtracked him to the shack, and took over his life.
