> **Count Varian Jeggare** is a [[Cheliax|Chelaxian]] noble and [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] of the [[Pathfinder Society]]. Along with his bodyguard, [[Radovan]], Jeggare has investigated mysterious deaths among the aristocracy of Cheliax and ventured deep into the mountains of [[Ustalav]] to learn the true fate of a missing [[Pathfinder]]. Since his Ustalavic trip, the count has been accompanied by his faithful Ustalavic wolfhound named **Arnisant**.. He is the son of Pontia Jeggare and Variel Morgethai.



## Background

> Jeggare learned magic at the [[Acadamae]], an arcane college in [[Korvosa]], where he specialized in [[Metamagic|metamagic]] and [[Magic/Evocation|evocation]]. Unfortunately, he experienced an unusual condition during his studies in which he suffered an acute case of nausea while retaining and casting [[Spell|spells]]. As a result, he abandoned his studies and returned to his home in [[Greensteeples]] in [[Egorian]]. Despite this peculiar condition, Jeggare eventually passed the final examination at the Acadamae.
> During a trip to [[Ustalav]], Jeggare rediscovered the secrets of [[Riffle scroll|riffle scrolls]] in an obscure library. With this new method of casting spells, he had a handy remedy for the crippling nausea he normally suffered.
> Jeggare is a worshipper of [[Desna]] first and foremost, but only in private; in public as a count of Cheliax, he has to perform due service to [[Asmodeus]], his country's patron deity.
> As a patron of the Pathfinder Society, he secretly operates a [[Pathfinder lodge]] out of his manor home of Greensteeples, an act that violates laws against certain Society activity in Cheliax.
