> **Firoj** is the owner and operator of the wretched [[Slave|slave]] operation known as [[Saltfish Camp]] in the [[Pirate|pirate]] capital of [[Port Peril]]. Firoj has a keen eye for slaves and is able to help those who come to him, be they vicious pirate captains or ruthless overseers, to find the perfect slave. Firoj maintains his control over his charges with the aid of the turncoat slave [[Talsetus]], who befriends new slaves only to betray their confidence at the first sign of trouble.
