> **Phaegia** was once an influential priest of [[Aroden]]. She turned to the worship of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Orcus]] as she felt her life slipping away with her advancing years. Phaegia was transformed into a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] so she could "live" forever but she knows that her [[Undeath|undeath]] is a gift from Orcus and is careful to advance the demon lord's goals. Her fortress is a ruined temple of Aroden hidden deep in a forested valley. All symbols of Aroden have been scratched away and replaced with symbols of the demon lord Orcus. Phaegia's lieutenant is an old [[Vampire|vampire]] named Arishkov Wolfstongue. Her [[Phylactery|phylactery]] is a startlingly blue sapphire, which is hidden within a rotting tree trunk buried 50 feet beneath a small bog near her temple.
