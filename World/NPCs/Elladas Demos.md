> **Elladas Demos** is a [[Human|human]] smuggler and propagandist who lives in the [[Isger|Isgeri]] town of [[Dustpawn]] high in the [[Five Kings Mountains]]. She runs a prosperous warehouse dealing primarily in [[Goat|goat]] hides in the west end of town known as [[Demos Leather Goods]], which also serves as a front for her illegal smuggling operation.
> Demos employs a large retinue of bandits who also serve as her warehouse employees. These men and women regularly move hot items between their hiding places in the abandoned mine tunnels outside of town and the warehouse. Elladas has a standing arrangement with Mayor Kurigoss, preventing local bandit attacks in exchange for useful information and supplies, and may have similar contacts within nearby [[Druma]] as well. She also believes that the ruler of [[Cheliax]], [[Abrogail Thrune II|Queen Abrogail II]], is a bastard who traffics with [[Demon|demons]].
