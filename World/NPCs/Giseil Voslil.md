> The [[Gray elf|gray elven]] [[Necromancer|necromancer]] **Giseil Voslil** serves as the emissary of the [[Mordant Spire]] to the elves of the [[Mierani Forest]]. He has lived in the settlement of [[Crying Leaf]] for centuries, and is the most powerful necromancer in the Mierani Forest. He specializes in the "recycling" of dead flesh, wishing to utilize the bodies of the dead by means other than [[Necromancy|raising them]]. To this end, he developed the spell *recorporeal incarnation*, which disguises the bodies of the living with dead ones.


## Appearance

> Unlike his fellow [[Mordant Spire elves]], Giseil is not normally masked, but wears loose-fitting robes embroidered with skulls. He carries a staff whose top still looks like a living branch, complete with several leaves.


## Affiliations

> Other than his obvious connections to the elves of Mordant Spire and Crying Leaf, Giseil also maintains good relations with the elven organization known as the [[Shin'Rakorath|ShinRakorath]].
