> When the town of [[Sandpoint]] founded the [[Turandarok Academy]], the retired [[Adventurer|adventurer]] **Ilsoari Gandethus** volunteered to be the school and orphanage's headmaster on the condition that he could use the basement of the building for his own use. In this space, which he keeps locked from the children of the Academy, he holds a large collection of exotic [[Weapon|weapons]], strange maps, and monster trophies gathered during his adventuring days.
> He is quite open with his [[Arcane|arcane]] museum to anyone who asks, but he allows the orphans and students of the Academy to spin their outrageous rumors of the true nature of his basement lair, seeming to get some level of amusement from their wildly imaginative theories. In truth, most of the unused [[Magic item|magic items]] and objects of value have long since been sold to fund Ilsoari's taste in [[Alcoholic beverages|wine]], except for a [[Platinum|platinum]] key etched with the [[Sihedron]].
> Although Ilsoari accepts that his adventuring days are long past, he still regrets that he and his group never had the chance to explore the [[Pit Sandpoint hinterlands|Pit]], and suspects that there are ancient ruins hidden in 'the [[Dungeon|dungeon]] that got away'. Since lore about ancient [[Thassilon]] resurfaced, he believes that stories about [[Dwarf|dwarven]] caves in the Pit actually refer to Thassilonian secrets, and thinks that his unusual key unlocks a door somewhere within it.
