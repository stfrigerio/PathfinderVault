> **Daronlyr XII** is considered by most to be amongst the greatest [[Grand Prince|Grand Princes]] that [[Taldor]] has ever had, despite usurping the crown via the bloody murder of [[Parmain IV]].


## History

> Daronlyr was born in [[3535 AR]], the only son of Isidoron who was Grand Prince Parmain III's younger brother. Even before his assent to throne, Daronlyr worked tirelessly in the [[Senate|Taldan Senate]] to better Taldor, trying to mitigate the damage done by the indolent and weak Parmain IV. When Daronlyr learned that Parmain was planning on ceding large swathes of Taldor's holdings in [[Isger]] to the [[Kellid|Kellids]], he could take no more. Daronlyr drew his blade and, after fighting with the [[Ulfen Guard]], stabbed Parmain in the heart before seizing the [[Primogen Crown]] and declaring himself emperor.
> Daronlyr used his abilities as a ferocious orator to persuade the Ulfen Guard to swear their loyalty to him, despite dispatching their previous master in such a bloody manner. Following his coronation, Daronlyr began work pacifying the northern Kellids but he is most well-remembered for the institutions he established, such as the First Imperial Arcanists' Guild in [[3571 AR]] and the world famous [[Kitharodian Academy]] in [[3578 AR]]. Daronlyr's reign ended in [[3587 AR]] when he was claimed by an outbreak of Blanching Sickness that swept western Taldor.


## Personality

> Daronlyr XII was a man renowned for his command and mastery. He commanded the loyalty of his people, had mastered both the blade and [[Magic|magic]] but, most importantly, had total mastery of himself and had none of the self-indulgent tendencies common to Grand Princes.
