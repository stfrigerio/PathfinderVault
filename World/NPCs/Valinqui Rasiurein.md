> **Valinqui Rasiurein** is the current [[Drow|drow]] High Commandant of the Fighting Society, headquartered in the fortress of [[Harrowspire]] in the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Sekamina]].


## Appearance

> Rasiurein dislikes the ostentatious clothes that most drow wear, preferring an almost spartan appearance. He is covered by numerous scars given to him by various ambitious ex-students, but refuses to wear armor, believing that it restricts his movement while fighting.


## Personality

> Unusually deliberative and methodical for his race, Rasiurein waits for one of the feuding noble houses of [[Zirnakaynin]] to emerge as a clear victor so that he may throw the support of his school behind them. The ambitious Matriarch of [[House Azrinae]] has recently caught his attention, and he has even gone as far as to invite her to Harrowspire, which she has so far refused.
