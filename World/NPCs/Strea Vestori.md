> **Strea Vestori** is a [[Tiefling|tiefling]] in [[Kintargo]], a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city where the race is unpopular. As of [[4715 AR]], she has operated the [[Cloven Hoof Society]] for several years in support of the city's tieflings. Strea had made great progress with increasing tiefling rights within the city, aided by [[Hetamon Haace]], the leader of Kintargo's secret cult of [[Milani]], known as the Rose of Kintargo. Unfortunately, her work got the attention of the new [[Barzillai Thrune|Lord-Mayor Barzillai Thrune]] and when he consolidated his power during the [[KintargoHistory|Night of Ashes]], Strea was abducted by agents of [[House Thrune]] and imprisoned in the [[Temple of Asmodeus Kintargo|Temple of Asmodeus]].
