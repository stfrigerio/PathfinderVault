> **Lord Lander Lebeda** recently became the head of [[House Lebeda]] of [[Brevoy]], succeeding his mother, [[Sarrona Lebeda|Sarrona]], who had been the family regent until his coming of age.



## Appearance

> Lander is described as a tall, handsome young man with fair hair and a goatee.


## Family

> His mother, Dame Sarrona, led House Lebeda after her husband died. Lander's older sister, [[Elanna Lebeda|Elanna]], lives in [[New Stetven]].


## Background

> As a youth, Lander focused most of his energies on proving himself as an accomplished swordsman in imitation of the [[Aldori swordlords]], which included taking Marek Bogdan as his master, though some believed he neglected his official duties. In [[4714 AR]], Bogdan betrayed and kidnapped Lander, forcing Sarrona to hire the [[Pathfinder Society]] to recover him. He was also childhood friends with [[Sylvanna Orlovsky]], despite his family's feud with hers.


## Recent History

> In [[4717 AR]], Lander was sent to attempt to resolve a conflict between noble houses in Zmeyka.
> Soon thereafter, a prospective alliance between the ruling [[House Surtova]] and House Lebeda that would have symbolically united [[Rostland]] ([[Elanna Lebeda]]) and [[Issia]] ([[Noleski Surtova|King Noleski Surtova]]) and brought much needed stability to fractured Brevoy, fell apart in [[4718 AR]] when Natala accused Lander of treason. Lord Lander disappeared soon thereafter, leaving the would-be bride to return home in humiliation. Since Lord Lander had been accused of harboring revolutionary sentiments numerous times during his youth, most of the Brevic nobility believed Natala's accusations. The notable exception were members of [[House Orlovsky]], who claimed that the facts supporting the purported treason were contradictory and unclear, and countered that this was most likely Surtovan propaganda. This has caused a significant fracture between the houses of Surtova and Orlovsky, one that threatens to escalate into armed confrontation.
