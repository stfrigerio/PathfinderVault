> **Syl Gar** is the Magistrate of Expenditures for the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]].  As such he is responsible for spending levied taxes on the city's behalf, primarily in the upkeep of city buildings such as Seawatch Tower and [[Castle Korvosa]], and in paying its employees, such as the [[Sable Company]] and the [[Korvosan Guard]].  Because his appearance often announces new contracts and payments, he is greatly loved among the merchants of the city.
