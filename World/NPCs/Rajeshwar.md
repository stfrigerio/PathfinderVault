> **Rajeshwar** is the incumbent maharajah of [[Vudra]], and supreme ruler of all of Vudra's petty kingdoms.


## Relatives

> Rajeshwar is the eldest child of Vudra's previous maharajah, and a descendant of [[Khiben-Sald]], the legendary unifier of Vudra. Since seizing the throne, this individual of mysterious and indistinct gender has given birth to multiple children without the aid of any other parents, leading to rumours that Rajeshwar is actually the avatar of a [[Deity|deity]].


## Background

> Rajeshwar came into power by proving to be a gifted [[Psychic|psychic]] during a bloody struggle for the throne.
