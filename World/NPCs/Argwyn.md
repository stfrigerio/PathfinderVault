> **Argwyn** is a [[Blighted fey|blighted]] [[Glaistig|glaistig]] created by the corrupted [[Dryad|dryad]] [[Arlantia]] by fusing her own essence with that of [[Gendowyn]], her predecessor and prisoner. Like Arlantia, Argwyn wields the power of the [[Darkblight]], but Argwyn's is more subtle and bestows upon its host health and beauty. Arlantia originally intended to use Argwyn to spread the Darkblight past the wards placed by the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Kraggodan]], but after greedy [[Human|human]] looters destroyed the wards, she forgot about her project and sealed Argwyn deep within her Pestilent Palace.
