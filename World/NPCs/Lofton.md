> **Lofton** is a former adventurer in his later years. He holds the rank of [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] in the [[Pathfinder Society]].
> His current assignment is within [[Galt]] in the city of [[Woodsedge]]. Sent by the [[Decemvirate]], Lofton is tasked with reclaiming the ruined [[Woodsedge Lodge]], finding information on any stolen artifacts, and avenging the murdered [[Pathfinder]] from the riots of [[4704 AR]].
> In order to escape detection from the revolutionaries, Lofton poses as a barrister arguing in defense of the condemned in trials. These attempts are futile as the trials are mostly staged to appease the mobs.
> Lofton works alongside two other operatives, the [[Sorcerer|sorceress]] [[Senri Stenn]] and the [[Half-orc|half-orc]] [[Thuurv]]. The trio sponsors Pathfinders on missions to reclaim lost treasures and explore nearby lands. 
> They base their operations in the hidden basements of the so-called [[Barren Museum]].
