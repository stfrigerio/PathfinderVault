> **Grand Prince Stavian II** was the ruler of [[Taldor]] in the 45th and 46th centuries [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]]. His reign was weakened by attempting to appease the squabbles among the royalty, senatorial classes, and wealthy nobles. He was succeeded by his son, [[Stavian III]].


## Family

> Stavian was father to two children, [[Carrius I]] and later [[Stavian III]], though he favoured the eldest son. An [[Disease|influenza]] outbreak in [[4664 AR]] claimed the life of Carrius, leaving the Grand Prince devastated and unwilling to mourn for the loss of his heir. The tragedy moved the Taldan public, especially when resurrection attempts failed, but damaged the relationship between Stavian II and his surviving son further. The two ultimately made amends just before the Grand Prince's death, after which Stavian III ascended to the throne.
