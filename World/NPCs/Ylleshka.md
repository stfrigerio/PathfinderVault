> **Ylleshka** was formed from the [[Soul|souls]] of two sisters born on a world far from [[Golarion]], where they ruled a nation alongside each other. They were extremely close to each other, often speaking in unison and appearing almost to be a single mind in two bodies, but were cruel rulers and deeply disliked because each viewed the other as her only equal and the rest of their nation as something to be toyed with for their amusement. Their subjects eventually rose in rebellion and ultimately sacrificed themselves through the desperate act of a priest of a now-dead [[Deity|god]] of freedom who caused the [[Volcano|volcano]] above the twins' capital city to erupt, immolating the rebels and the sisters alike.
> The sisters' souls swiftly sank into the [[Abyss]], where their intense closeness in life and the shared nature of their sins caused a unique transformation—rather than each soul forming into a [[Demon|demon]] of its own, they fused together into a single twin-bodied [[Marilith|marilith]] with two heads and twelve arms.
> Ylleshka served numerous [[Demon lord|demon lords]] following her genesis in the Abyss, including [[Abraxas]], [[Aldinach]], [[Areshkagal]], [[Gogunta]], [[Haagenti]], [[Mestama]], [[Nurgal]], [[Orcus]], [[Shax]], [[Socothbenoth]], and [[Zura]], later leaving each one's service after betraying them. She also served almost two dozen [[Nascent demon lord|nascent demon lords]], most of whom are now dead—often by Ylleshka's own hand. She eventually entered the service of [[Baphomet]], whom she currently serves as the chief warden of his Ineluctable Prison.
