> **Birgitte Redmane** was the first member of the [[Ulfen Guard]].


## Background

> During the reign of [[Grand Prince]] [[Jalrune]], Birgitte spent many years in an [[Oppara|Opparan]] jail until she provided information that allowed Jalrune to drive away an [[Ice linnorm|ice linnorm]] rampaging through the [[World's Edge Mountains|Worlds Edge Mountains]]. She befriended [[Hyrotte I|Hyrotte]], the most vocal proponent of her release. After Jalrune was assassinated by [[Qadira|Qadiran]] spies, Hyrotte inherited the throne, and knowing that a lucky assassin could easily send him to the grave as well, he asked Birgitte to serve as his bodyguard. Birgitte went further and offered the service of her kin as well. Hyrotte, seeing the value in bodyguards unaffiliated with politics, decreed that he would only accept [[Ulfen]] folk as bodyguards. Thus the Ulfen Guard was born.
> Initially, only Birgitte's relatives were accepted into the Ulfen Guard, making her hometown of [[Vasterborg]] one of the richest towns in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. As demand for bodyguards grew, this restriction was eventually lifted, but Birgitte's descendants remained the most prestigious Ulfen Guards. In [[3313 AR]], Ingune Five-Embers, then commander of the Ulfen Guard and Birgitte's fifth-generation descendant, deserted her post in [[Taldor]] to defend Vasterborg from the invasion of [[Baba Yaga]]. She was never seen again and Birgitte's line died out, as Vasterborg, and all [[Raemerrund]], fell and the treasures they accumulated during their service to Taldor were funnelled to [[Whitethrone]].
