> **Trade Prince Aaqir al'Hakam** emigrated from [[Katheer]] to [[Absalom]] in [[4711 AR]], where he took over the [[Qadira faction]] of the [[Pathfinder Society]]. In short order, he established himself as a cunning economic strategist and mercantile tour de force, and by [[4714 AR]] Aaqir had parlayed that success into a deal to buy the faction's assets, partner with [[Sczarni]] crimelord [[Guaril Karela]], and form an ambitious new trade group called [[The Exchange faction|The Exchange]].
> He lives in one of his cousin Lady Nymara's many estates in the city—specifically the [[Merchants' Quarter|Merchants Quarter]]—with his longtime partner Emir Thalzar Gaatan and their three adopted daughters.
> Aaqir is described as a handsome, charming man with clearly Qadiran features. His hair is short and well groomed, and he keeps his face clean shaven.
