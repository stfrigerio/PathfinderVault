> **High Priest Rekaereil Sandurei** led the [[Imvrildarai]] until his assassination by [[Cambion|cambions]] in [[4714 AR]]. His body was also taken by his killers.
> An archivist and moderate in what was traditionally a militaristic sect of [[Calistria|Calistrian]] worship, Sandurei's appointment was the culmination of years of easy victories against [[Treerazer]] and its [[Demon|demonic]] forces. He is succeeded as High Priest by the more militaristic [[Delerenai Ashwalker]].
