> **Shanda Faravan** is native born and one of the four members of the [[Ravengro Council]], the ruling body of the town of [[Ravengro]] in the [[Canterwall]] county of the nation of [[Ustalav]]. She used to work as a royal accuser but left that job under a cloud and rarely speaks of that part of her life today. Councilwoman Faravan lives to the north of the town, west of the river.
