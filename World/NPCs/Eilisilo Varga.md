> **Eilisilo Varga** is the beautiful [[Hellknights]] now acting as [[Aericnein Neska|Count Aericnein Neskas]] secretary and bodyguard; indeed she is pretty much second only to the Count in power she wields in [[Barstoi]]. For instance, she is in active command of the county's police force. Her knights fear but do not favour Varga, and she has taken the nickname of the Chain Countess behind her back. Nevertheless, everyone understands her merciless capability in the field.


## History

> Count Aericnein Neska first met Eilisilo Varga on a visit to [[Egorian]] in [[Cheliax]], in [[4703 AR]], where Varga was a member of the [[Order of the Scourge]] [[Hellknights]]. There the Count watched the Hellknight's prowess and capability as she raided [[Desna|Desnan]] rebels and was so impressed he offered a job that very day. Varga declined the offer but, eventually, perhaps strangely, changed her mind and returned to Barstoi with the Count at the end of his stay.
