> Although the history of [[Daemon|daemonkind]] is constantly being edited to favour the current Horsemen, **Ceolaeros** the Twice Risen was the [[Horseman of Pestilence]] in distant history. It is believed that Ceolaeros made a deal with the entity known as [[Tegresin]] the Laughing Fiend in order to guarantee his position. Ceolaeros somehow failed his benefactor and went into exile after resigning from his position as Horseman, an unprecedented event for one of the [[Four Horsemen]].
