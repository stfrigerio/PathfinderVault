> **Gallar Porswan** is an ex-military officer of [[Galt]] who lives in [[Gralton]]. He strives to train the enthusiastic soldiers of Gralton's small army which has been assembled by [[Halidan Tarne|Lord General Halidan Tarne]]. Occasionally, the Gralton army launches small scale attacks on Galtan towns but the small groups of soldiers involved return after a few days bloodied and decimated. Gallar is thought long dead by those back in Galt.
