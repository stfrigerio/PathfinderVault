> **Jerikal Ashworth** is a retired [[Halfling|halfling]] adventurer-turned-brewmaster who now runs one of [[Katapesh city|Katapeshs]] most unique breweries, [[Jerikal's Ales|Jerikals Ales]]. This brewery is so unique because of Jerikal and his ability to imbue his alcohol with the magical qualities of a [[Potion|potion]] making his drinks very popular with adventurers. Interestingly for a [[Cleric|cleric]] so devoted to brewing, Jerikal is not a worshipper of [[Cayden Cailean]] but is, in fact, a worshipper of [[Shelyn]], the goddess of art and beauty; Jerikal claims brewing as his preferred artistic medium. He is good friends with Tomlin Orlof the local priest of Cayden Cailean who uses his brewery as the local temple to his god, an arrangement Jerikal seems happy with.
