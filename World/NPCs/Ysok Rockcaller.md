> **Shaman Ysok Rockcaller** is the [[Shamanism|shaman]] of the [[Haskodar Clan]] of the city of [[Blisterwell]] in the western [[Hold of Belkzen]], and subordinate to the tribe's chieftain, [[Tulluk Clovenface]]. The Haskodar Clan only arrived in Blisterwell in [[4701 AR]] as they are a tribe of [[Darklands]] [[Orc|orcs]] that migrated to the surface to overthrow the [[One Eye tribe]] and gain control of the city. This attempted overthrow is at the behest of the [[Duergar|duergar]] war-marshal of [[Fellstrok]], [[Brithuan]], as part of a truce to end the long war between the Haskodar Clan and the duergar.
