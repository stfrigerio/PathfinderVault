> The former ruler of [[Ustalav]], **Prince Valislav Ordranti**, was known to most as the **Eunuch Prince**. The Eunuch Prince was an unpopular ruler issuing poor decree after poor decree, including the decision to move Ustalav's capital from its traditional home of [[Ardis]] to the port city of [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]] in [[4674 AR]]. His death, later in 4674 AR, of a chronic illness caused his home country no end of problems: his younger brother [[Aduard Ordranti III|Aduard]] reluctantly accepted the burden of rule, as the Eunuch Prince was believed to have left no heirs. Unfortunately, it seems the Eunuch Prince failed to live up to his name with a long-time female companion, Millaera Caliphvaso, claiming that Valislav had fathered her child [[Reneis Ordranti|Reneis]]. This situation has caused much turmoil in Ustalav's court and remains unresolved.


## The Palatinates

> It was Prince Valislav's indifference that allowed the [[Palatinates]] in the north-west third of the country to gain their independence from their hereditary rulers. In [[4670 AR]], the northern province of [[Lozeri]] overthrew their hereditary duke, placing a council of prominent citizens in charge. This approach caught on, and soon two of the neighbouring counties—[[Canterwall]], and [[Vieland]]—had also thrown off the rule of their hereditary noble lords in bloodless coups.
