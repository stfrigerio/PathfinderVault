> While the grand vizier was in theory only an advisor to [[Hakim Khalid Suleiman XXIII|Grand Sultan Hakim Khalid Suleiman XXIII]], and latterly is to [[Ayasellah Mihelar Khalidlah II|Grand Sultana Ayasellah Mihelar Khalidlah II]], in reality, **Grand Vizier Abdul-Qawi** was and is co-ruler of the [[City of Brass]]. Officially, the position of grand vizier is subservient to the sultan or sultana, but in truth, both are equal in popularity and raw power. Abdul-Qawi is a more subtle ruler, for he is a patient manipulator, more prone to cloak-and-dagger political games than the outright displays of power that the sultan favored. Abdul-Qawi is said to control a [[Plane|planes]]-wide network of spies that assist him. He is also an incredibly powerful [[Wizard|wizard]], one who is supposedly well-versed in the taboo arts of [[Genie|genie]] binding. While once the grand vizier sought to overthrow the sultan, centuries of covert warfare have gained neither any ground and instead instilled each with a healthy respect for their opponent. Under the sultan, neither was really interested in upsetting this delicate balance of power as it benefited them both quite nicely. Abdul-Qawi makes his impressive home in the Vizier's Palace in the City of Brass's Mages' Quarter when he is not attending to matters at the Sultana's Palace.
