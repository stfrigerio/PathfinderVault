> **Rokiere** is a young [[Copper dragon|copper dragon]] who resides in the [[Takalak Hills]] of [[Motaku Isle]] in the [[Shackles]]. It is said that the [[Dragon|dragon]] has considerable knowledge about treasure buried in the region and she may reveal some of these secrets to any person able to make her laugh.
