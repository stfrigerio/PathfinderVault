> **Trilochan** is a mutated [[Gold dragon|gold dragon]] considered to be one of [[Rovagug]]'s children.


## Appearance

> Trilochan is a gold dragon with an ulcerous third eye, a mutation arising from the [[Venom|venom]] of [[Kothogaz]]. It can be presumed that, as a tarnished dragon, his scales have grown dull and colorless over time.


## History

> When Trilochan arrived is unknown, except that it was after [[Ulunat]]. Trilochan did battle with Kothogaz sometime before the latter's defeat in 300 AR. In the fighting, Trilochan was bitten, leading to mutation, [[Madness|madness]], and tarnishing. However, for unknown reasons, he is not considered a "true" tarnishing. The [[Dragon|dragon]] now lives in the forsaken [[Narhari Desert]] in [[Vudra]].
> While he is considered the "wisest and wiliest of Rovagug's children", he suffers from hallucinations seen in his third eye that he cannot distinguish from reality.
