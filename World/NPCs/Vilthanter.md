> **Vilthanter** is the commander of Irith-Arnakian, the [[Urdefhan|urdefhan]] fortress in the Urkalla district of [[Ilvarandin]] (one of the vaults of [[Orv]], in the [[Darklands]]). 
> She has over 1,000 soldiers under her command, and new recruits must prove their worth by single-handedly recovering five skulls from the wilds of Ilvarandin. The empty skulls of victims of the [[Intellect devourer|intellect devourers]] bestow additional status.
> Most urdefhan males are sterile, and one quarter of childbirths result in the death of the mother. This makes the fact that Vilthanter has survived five births, and in each case the sire was an urdefhan male, truly remarkable. Vilthanter previously defeated each of the sires in single combat.
