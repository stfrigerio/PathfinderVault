> The eccentric scholar **Khamos Al-Awlaq** owns a small antiquities shop in the mercantile district of [[Eto]] in [[Osirion]]. He sells unusual objects and pieces of art to wealthy collectors, [[Adventurer|adventurers]] and royal courts that have been excavated. He often contributes to the Grand Library of Eto. He welcomes fellow tomb raiders whom he frequently employs to perform seemingly small tasks that inevitably unravel into dangerous adventures of questionable morality. Khamos' secret is that he in fact a [[Ghoul|ghoul]].
> Around [[4702 AR]], he made his way out of [[Jetrieti V]]'s tomb with an incredibly powerful [[Artifact|artifact]] which inflicted upon him a [[Disease|deadly illness]]. Khamos was in desperation and he began to consume powdered mumia even though he knew the risks involved. The foul substance invigorated Khamos, who began to buy a growing number of corpses to enjoy his new youthfulness.
