> **Erin Souston** was the historical founder of the town of [[Souston]], located on [[Andoran|Andorans]] [[Inner Sea]] coast. A naval captain, she crashed her [[Ship|ship]] on the rocky shore of southern Andoran during a particularly thick fog, and soon thereafter founded the town at that very spot. It has long been rumored that she carried a valuable treasure with her, a rumor that has attracted numerous [[Pirate|pirates]] to raid the town over the years, but so far nothing has been found.
