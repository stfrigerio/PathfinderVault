> **Vesyapremi** is one of the three cruel lieutenants of [[Bedu Hanji]], the mandrill-headed [[Rakshasa|rakshasa]] who rules the [[Rampore Isles]] in the [[Shackles]]. Hanji leaves [[Ghrinitshahara]] in the hands of her three lieutenants when she sails on her massive [[Ship|galleon]] *[[Semudarogah]]*. Each of these lieutenants is devoted to Hanji and harbors a burning hatred for the other two.
