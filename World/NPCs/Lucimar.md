> **Lucimar** is the most influential member of the [[Whispering Way]], an organization that promotes [[Undeath|undeath]]. Once an undead follower of [[Urgathoa]], he claims to have been taught the secrets of the Way by [[Tar-Baphon]]—the Whispering Tyrant himself—while Lucimar was exploring the Tyrant's [[Gallowspire]] prison.
> He was once [[Human|human]], but now appears to be an undead [[Worg|worg-like]] creature. He lives in the [[Ghasterhall]], in [[Ustalav|Ustalavs]] benighted [[Virlych]] province, where his insane followers often bleed themselves to the edge of death.
