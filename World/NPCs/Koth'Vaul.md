> **Koth'Vaul** is a [[Glabrezu|glabrezu]] [[Demon|demon]] and long-term foe of the [[Pathfinder Society]].


## Background

> Koth'Vaul emerged from the [[Abyss]] millennia ago. Disguised as wise advisors, he tempted numerous [[Mortality|mortal]] rulers to [[Damnation|damnation]] and disappeared before any of them could understand, earning respect among many lesser demons. He was eventually imprisoned underground after a cabal of [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] [[Wizard|wizards]] discovered his deception and exposed part of his [[True name|true name]]. As time weakened his wards, Koth'Vaul tried to break through them but was banished by [[Pathfinder Society]] agents to the Abyss.
> Koth'Vaul quickly learnt about the events on [[Golarion]] since his imprisonment, gathered strength and researched the Pathfinder Society. He aided the corrupted [[Venture-Captain]] [[Thurl]] and aided his siege of [[Absalom]], abandoning him when the siege failed. At the same time, the [[Mendevian Crusades]] ended in victory: the [[Worldwound]] was closed and the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Deskari]] killed. Knowing that a fragment of Deskari's power still lurked in his corpse, Koth'Vaul travelled to the [[Rift of Repose]] and stole one of Deskari's hearts, to fuel his transformation into a demon lord himself, then hid in an unclaimed part of the Abyss which he could later claim as his own.
