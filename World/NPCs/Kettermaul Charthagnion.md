> **Archheathen Kettermaul Charthagnion** is the mayor of the city of [[Corentyn]]. He is a former captain in the [[Chelish Navy]] and a fair administrator. A traditionalist in the new infernal [[Cheliax]], he maintains power through pacts with various [[Devil|devils]] and a close professional friendship with [[Uro Adom|Lictor Uro Adom]] of the [[Order of the Chain]]. 
> Kettermaul strongly influences, if not outright controls the [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]] in the city. He is frequently
accompanied by his [[Gelugon|gelugon]] advisor, [[Oronothos]], in public. The two have adjoining offices in the [[Archheathen's Manor|Archheathens Manor]], one of a cluster of government buildings overlooking the harbor. 
> Kettermaul is a handsome, muscular, dark-haired man. He is an excellent dancer, and usually attends every noble ball accompanied by his wife [[Iridelia Charthagnion|Iridelia]], though he finds most noble pursuits wearisome. Kettermaul and Iridelia's marriage was a marriage of convenience for political reasons and they sleep in separate rooms, often with separate lovers. The nobles fight for their attention nonetheless.
> Kettermaul has, however, fallen out of favor with [[House Charthagnion|his family]], as he no longer treats his dealings with [[Asmodeus]] and [[Hell]] as a religion, but instead considers it a matter of business and necessity.
