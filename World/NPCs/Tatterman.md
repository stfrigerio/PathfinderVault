> The entity known as **the Tatterman** is an ancient servant of the [[Great Old One]] [[Hastur]], whom he has served in the [[Dimension of Dreams]] and on [[Golarion]] alike for many centuries. The Tatterman is a murderous predator who infiltrates sleeping minds to hunt and kill dreaming [[Mortal|mortals]]. He first entered Golarion's history in the days of ancient [[Sarkoris]], when he was one of the many beings worshipped by the polytheistic [[Kellid|Kellids]] and served as an intermediary figure for the cult of his master. He eventually fell out of the religious mainstream, due to both shifting influences and popularities of the Kellids' various faiths and the annihilation of Sarkoris by the opening of the [[Worldwound]], but he was eventually discovered by a Kellid [[Witch|witch]] named [[Ariadnah]], who [[Summoned|summoned]] and bound him as a servant for her own [[Evil|evil]] schemes.
> The Tatterman returned to relative inactivity after Ariadnah's disappearance, but his attention remained on the location of his last summoning—the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] island of [[Briarstone Isle|Briarstone]]—haunting the nightmares of those living there and most recently finding a useful receptacle in the mind of Ulver Zandalus. Zandalus is a former scholar driven [[Mad|mad]] by exposure to the alienness of the Dreamlands and whose tortured mind proved a fitting means for the Tatterman to once again enter the [[Material Plane]].
