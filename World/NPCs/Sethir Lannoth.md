> **Sethir Lannoth** is the leader of a clan of ascetic worshipers of [[Irori]] who believe the [[Ethereal Plane]] and its manifestations of dreams and nightmares offer the answers they seek. Their isolated temple is located on the [[Mount Na-Ken]] in [[Osirion]]. Sethir has perfected a technique that through dreams allows hand-to-hand combat to initiate brief entry to Ethereal Plane.
