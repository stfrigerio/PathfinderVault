> **Admiral Marris Riddian** is the commander of both [[Castle Golbanze]] and the [[Ship|ships]] of the Ustalavic Navy that use the castle as their home base. Marris is widely known as an honourable commander and her duties include protecting the people of [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]] (and those who dwell along [[Ustalav|Ustalavs]] coast) from the [[Pirate|pirates]] of [[Lake Encarthan]], aquatic monsters of all sorts, and sometimes even fanatics from nearby [[Razmiran]] sailing their so-called 'faith barges'. Under Marris's command are some of the Ustalavic Navy's most famous vessels, including the *Devilfish*, under the command of [[Almira Perine|Captain Almira Cardinal Perine]]; *Princess Maraet*, commanded by [[Liald Gaspair|Captain Liald Gaspair]]; and the largest ship of the navy, the *Indomitable*, captained by [[Leos Tailor]].
