> **Paraduke Marcellus Thurivan** nominally oversees the goings-on in all of the [[Archduchy of Hellcoast]] in [[Cheliax]], from its capital of [[Belde]]. Thurivan is charged with reclaiming Hellcoast from rebels in [[Pezzack]], the archduchy's former capital which has been in open rebellion since [[4710 AR]], as well as the violent, insurrectionist [[Strix|strix]] of [[Devil's Perch|Devils Perch]].
> Thurivan, who was appointed by [[House Thrune]] to replace the previous ruler of Hellcoast after Pezzack [[Second Ashes|fell to rebellion]], is himself embattled. The residents of Belde view him as little more than a crony of House Thrune and openly ignore his laws and tax collectors. Rumors suggest that he is planning on exterminating dissenters instead of more strategic reactions, as House Thrune might punish him if he is unable to restore its rule over western Cheliax.
