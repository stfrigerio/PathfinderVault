> **Himoko Na-ichi** is one of the most powerful members of the ruling council of [[Dhucharg]]. Unlike all of her colleagues, she disagrees with their leader [[Tsung-cha Kavangaki]], and wants to see Dhucharg focus more on expanding [[Kaoling]] instead of policing itself. Although Kavangaki has tried to limit Na-ichi's influence, she has powerful allies (rumoured to include Jenji Tukozami and Genji Yamata) and is far too high-profile to simply disappear.
