> **Richemar Alamansor** is the former commander of [[Citadel Rivad]] and [[Hellknight ranks|Lictor]] of the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Rack]], and one of the oldest living Hellknights in the [[Inner Sea region]]. Due to his experience and deeds, he holds a legendary status among all Hellknights. Lictor Alamansor holds confiscated book burning ceremonies in Valignus which he terms '[[Clarity pyre|clarity pyres]]'.
> In [[4716 AR]], Richemar Alamansor stepped down as leader of the Order of the Rack and appointed [[Darcyne Wrens]] as his successor, a move that met with quiet disapproval, as Lictor Wrens was originally a [[World/Culture/Titles & Kings/Hellknight signifer|signifer]] and did not come from the martial ranks. He continues to stay in his personal chambers at [[Citadel Rivad]], working on a complex manuscript and offering advice when asked by his successor.
