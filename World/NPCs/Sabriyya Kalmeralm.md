> Known to the merchants of the [[Bazaar of Sails]] as the "Princess of the Markets," **Lord-Mayor Sabriyya Kalmeralm** unofficially polices [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] busiest bazaar, doing what the [[Magnimar city watch|official city watch]] finds impossible. Some critics accuse Sabriyya of being little more than the city's most prominent criminal, running nothing more than a gang-style protection racket, but those who trade within the Bazaar appreciate the protection she provides. Sabriyya herself is in her mid-forties  and is renowned for her noble demeanor and razor sharp wit. She is also known for her temper and her long memory for those who have wronged her.
> Sabriyya inherited the position from her father [[Nazir Kalmeralm|Nazir]] who disappeared in [[4679 AR]]. At some point between [[4712 AR|4712]] and [[4719 AR]], she was elected lord-mayor of [[Magnimar]] after the previous officeholder, [[Haldmeer Grobaras]], died under mysterious circumstances.
