> The [[Green hag|green hag]] **Ulizmila** arrived in [[Darkmoon Wood]] in [[4609 AR]].
> The bone-hard folk of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] weathered the Harpy-Hag Massacre of [[4603 AR]], finally ending the conflict by marrying a [[Larko family|Larko]] son off to one of Ulizmila's many daughters.
> It is said that Ulizmila, is a daughter of [[Baba Yaga]]. Ulizmila's Cottage is located deep in the Darkmoon Wood but none dares look for her cottage. Rumor has it that Ulizmila could kill with a word, turn a man into a [[Goat|goat]], and shoot lightning from her eyes. Although her ugly cottage still lingers in a clearing in the forest, Ulizmila is long since gone. She left Darkmoon Vale several decades ago.
