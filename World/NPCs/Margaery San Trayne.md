> **Margaery San Trayne** was the inventor of the *[[Nethys/Artifacts/Final Blade|final blades]]*, the magical guillotines that have been used throughout [[Galt|Galts]] [[Red Revolution]].


## History

> After the people of Galt overthrew their [[Cheliax|Chelish-backed]] government in [[4667 AR]], its replacement, the [[Revolutionary Council]], commissioned the creation of a method of execution that would be both efficient and humane. Under the leadership of the poet-philosophers [[Darl Jubannich]] and [[Hosetter]], Margaery San Trayne created the *final blades*, which were capable of capturing the souls of the executed, thus preventing any resurrection. Trayne's secondary concern was that the *final blades* would prevent the souls from falling into the hands of any Chelish [[Devil|devils]].
