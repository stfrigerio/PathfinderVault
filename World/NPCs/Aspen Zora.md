> **Archdruid Aspen Zora** leads the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] council of [[Crystalhurst]], a reclusive town hidden in the [[Fangwood 1]] of [[Nirmathas]].


## Background

> Zora was born in Crystalhurst, and as a young adult developed an innate natural connection. She spent 6 months deep in the Fangwood, and when she returned was named the town council's archdruid. She refuses to discuss what she experienced, but returned with a new sense of peace and leadership beyond her years, as well as blue tattoos on her face and hands.
