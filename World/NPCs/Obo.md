> [[Venture-Captain]] **Obo** runs the [[Swordmeet Lodge]] in the port city of [[Manaket]], [[Rahadoum]].

The venture-captain sends expeditions to the ruins in the valleys of the central [[Napsune Mountains]], including fabled places such as [[Lost Yemal]], the [[Hanging City of Teskra]], and the [[Tomb of Emperors]].
