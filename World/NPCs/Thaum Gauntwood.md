> **Captain Thaum Gauntwood** is the current commander of the [[Castle Everstand]] in [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]]. Standing well over 6 feet tall, he is an imposing figure. The soldiers of the castle more than respect him—they follow him unerringly, as if he could lead them to the light when no other could. He commands a garrison of 220 soldiers—a mixture of archers, foot soldiers, mounted [[Knight|knights]], battle [[Cleric|clerics]] and more specialized combatants. Gauntwood believes that the leaders in [[Vigil]] care more about preserving the status quo in the region than taking the fight to the [[Orc|orcs]], and he is not alone in this opinion. Many other commanders and soldiers among the Lastwall border forts agree with him. If he does not see more active support from the government, Gauntwood might even take matters into his own hands and launch his own attacks, something that would probably not end well for his troops.
