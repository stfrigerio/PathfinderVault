> **Gulreesh** is the self-proclaimed king of the [[Otyugh|otyugh]]. He rules the undercity of the city of [[Zimar]] in [[Taldor]], holding court from a huge cistern. He demands respect from all who enter his realm, and it is that rumoured he eats those who offend him.
> It is not clear why the authorities of Zimar tolerate the otyugh. They take no action against Gulreesh or his servants; some speculate that he might know some dark secret about the city's rulers.
