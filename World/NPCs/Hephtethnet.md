> **Hephtethnet the Reaver** is an [[Hieracosphinx|hieracosphinx]] who terrorized southern [[Osirion]] during [[Kenaton|Pharaoh Kenaton]]'s reign. The [[Tomb of the Bound Sphinx]], which was constructed to be Kenaton's final resting place, serves as a magical prison for the mythic hieracosphinx. Pharaoh Kenaton's last great act was to magically bind the monster in the heart of his tomb, where it will remain until it collects a thousand riddles.
