> A powerful, bombastic [[Kellid human ethnicity|Kellid]] warrior from the north, **Joadric Heimurl** now concentrates his efforts on [[Varisia]]. He currently resides in the [[Heidmarch Manor]] [[Pathfinder lodge|lodge]] in [[Magnimar]] where he has been for some time. Joadric has been intending to launch an expedition into the [[Malgorian Mountains]] far to the east of Magnimar but he has yet to attract enough interest from other [[Pathfinders]] to launch the expedition. In the meantime, he has hit the [[Alcoholic beverages|bottle]] to help alleviate the boredom of waiting for the expedition to start and has not submitted any reports for the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]* in quite some time.
> Rumor has it that Joadric Heimurl is seeking the fabled city of [[Xin-Shalast]].
