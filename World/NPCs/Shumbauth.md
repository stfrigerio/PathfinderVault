> **Shumbauth** is a legendary creature believed to live in the depths of the western region of [[Lake Nirthran]] in [[Sekamina]].
> The [[Skum|skum]] of [[Cold Momugado]] revere it as a [[Deity|god]]. The [[Drow|drow]] and [[Ghoul|ghouls]] of Sekamina think it might be a very ancient [[Alghollthu master|alghollthu master]], left behind when its [[Alghollthu|kin]] abandoned the region many millennia ago, but others speculate that it could be something even more alien, such as a mother of oblivion or a previously undocumented [[Spawn of Rovagug]]. Visitors to the city only describe a horrific, tentacled mass, and cannot agree on its exact nature.
