> **Gashgelag the Dread** was an enormous [[Vavakia|vavakia]], a powerful [[Demon|demon]] that would have ordinarily been ruling a large [[Abyssal realm]] in his own right. Gashgelag was forced to flee the [[Abyss]] after he failed in an attempt to usurp control of a large island among the [[Flensing Rocks]] of [[Ishiar]], a region ruled by [[Ovonovo]]. He came to the [[Worldwound]] through a [[Portal|portal]] while fleeing pursuit. Gashgelag led small groups of demons in successful attacks against the [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]] that remained in the Worldwound. In [[4712 AR]], he nearly slew [[Khraigorr Half-Face]], leader of the [[Hornbreakers]], but his own terrible wounds forced him to *[[Teleport|teleport]]* away.
> Since the closing of the Worldwound at the end of the [[Fifth Mendevian Crusade]] in [[4718 AR]], his current fate remains unknown.
