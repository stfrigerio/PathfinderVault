## History

> Over a century ago, Illcayna Alonnor was a priestess of [[Urgathoa]] who martyred herself to feed an uncontrolled group of wights. She was resurrected by her [[Deity|goddess]] and transformed into a [[Daughter of Urgathoa|daughter of Urgathoa]], and later took control of the [[Undead|undead]] who had killed her. She then attacked the village of Finder's Gulch and killed all of its inhabitants, transforming it into their new headquarters. Alonnor has spent the last hundred years raiding Isger, [[Cheliax]], and [[Molthune]] for bodies to increase her wight army.
