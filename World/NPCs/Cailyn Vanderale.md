> **Cailyn Vanderale** was one of the twin [[Wizard|wizard]] heroes that saved the city of [[Magnimar]] in [[4623 AR]] from an attack by [[Shriezyx|shriezyx]] that had been imprisoned within the [[Irespan]] presumably since the fall of ancient [[Thassilon]]. Thanks to Cailyn and [[Romre Vanderale|Romre]] valiant efforts, and their adventuring band called the [[Eyes of the Hawk]], the day was saved. They managed to rally the local militia and drive the creatures back into the Irespan before collapsing the chamber they came from sealing them back in the bridge. The twins are still considered local heroes and several sites are dedicated to them including [[Twins' Gate|Twins Gate]], [[The Guardians]] and, especially, the [[Eyes of the Hawk monument|Eyes of the Hawk]] monument in [[Dockway]].
