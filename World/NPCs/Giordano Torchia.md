> The leader of the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Gate]], [[Vicarius]] **Giordano Torchia**, can rarely be seen without his iron mask.  He is a man more whispered about than seen, and these whispers speak of a powerful [[Wizard|wizard]] who planewalks throughout the many levels of existence, yet simultaneously knowing everything that happens within the walls of [[Citadel Enferac]].
