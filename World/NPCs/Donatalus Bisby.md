> **Donatalus Bisby** was a famed [[Pathfinder]], now deceased. He was the most well-known member among the celebrated adventuring party, the Amber Privateers. Bisby launched his various expeditions from [[Delvehaven]], a [[Pathfinder lodge]] in [[Westcrown]], [[Cheliax]].


## Accomplishments

> With the Amber Privateers, Bisby launched several successful  and highly publicized forays into remote regions including the [[Crown of the World]], the Rivers of No Return in the legendary half-caverns beneath the Isle of Phahalen, the jungles south of [[Sargava]], and the remote reaches of [[Iobaria]] east of [[Brevoy]]. He was also one of the first to visit the royal courts of the Miracle Samurai in [[Tian Xia]] and acquire the magical item, truecolor dye.  Bisby is further credited with recovering the once lost treaties "The Field of Endless Hues", penned by the deceased [[Loremaster|loremaster]] Forthas Tuchinault.
