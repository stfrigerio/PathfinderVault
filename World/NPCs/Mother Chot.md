> **Mother Chot** is an extremely old [[Orc|orc]] [[Alchemist|alchemist]] who breeds and creates terrifying [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarps]] and [[Necromancy|necromantic]] creations in her home of [[Dretha's Cradle|Drethas Cradle]] in the northern [[Hold of Belkzen]]. Mother Chot spent much of her early life as a [[Slave|slave]] to the [[Drow|drow]] fleshwarper [[Xilganni Parastric]] of [[House Parastric]] near the [[Darklands]] city of [[Zirnakaynin]] (possibly within [[Moaning Vault|the Moaning Vault]]). Mother Chot gained her freedom during the escape and subsequent rampage of several fleshwarped abominations. During this havoc, she also managed to take her former master Xilganni as a slave. Reaching the surface in the eastern reaches of the [[Kodar Mountains]], she found allies amongst the [[Mangled Limb tribe]]. She eventually tortured the secrets of rudimentary fleshwarping from her former master and began experimenting to try and create new warbeasts for sale to the tribes of the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. Dretha's Cradle now serves as her [[Laboratory|laboratory]] and workshop where dozens of apprentices help her create various unique warbeasts as well as [[Oronci|oronci]] fleshwarped from captured orcs and necrocrafts made from discarded flesh. Mother Chot's favourite creation is a unique [[Flesh golem|flesh golem]] she created to serve as her mount that includes the remains of her former master Xilganni Parastric.
