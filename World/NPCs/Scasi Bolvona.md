> **Scasi Bolvona** is a [[Durotas]] (city guard captain) of the [[Westcrown Dottari|condottari]] or 'canal wardens'. Scasi is political ambitious and maintains many friends and connections with the powers that be in [[Westcrown]], however his potential is compromised by his mixed blood daughter that he has sought to sweep under the carpet. His [[Half-elf|half-elven]] daughter Casisara currently lives with family in [[Ostenso]].
