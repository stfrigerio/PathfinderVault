> **Captain Boverde Hoptler** is the commanding officer of the [[Department of Constables and Investigators]] which effectively serves as the [[Caliphas city|Caliphass]] police department and city watch. Captain Boverde if gruff and jaded from years of service; not only does the Department serve as a police force, but he is also expected to enforce a broader mandate to "ensure the safety of Caliphas and all its people". Captain Boverde has no control over the secretive [[Bureau of Special Affairs]] with which he shares the [[Whiteshaw]] building.
