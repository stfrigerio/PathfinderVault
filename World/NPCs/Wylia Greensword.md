> **Wylia Greensword** serves [[Urdul Bazzak]] in the town of [[Deadbridge]] in the [[Protectorate of the Black Marquis]] and is captain of the flat-bottomed raider *[[Seabitch]]*. She is currently assigned to the wharfs of Deadbridge, which she defends with zeal.
> In her earlier days she enjoyed a modest reputation as a [[Pirate|pirate]] raider, but this came to an end after a feud with a more powerful pirate captain, forcing her to abandon her career and find new avenues of employment. She has since worked for the Black Marquis since he took office in [[4707 AR]].
