> **Traistlara** is the so-called **Hollow Queen** and ruler of the [[House of the Itinerant Soul]], a cathedral the size of a city, and a place of respite for [[Unfettered phantom|unfettered phantoms]] in the [[Ethereal Plane]]. During her many years ruling alongside her [[Phantom|phantom]] consort, she rarely exercises power and spends her time wandering the cathedral, trying to remember why she was bound to it.
