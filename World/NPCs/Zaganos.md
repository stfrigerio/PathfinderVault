> **Zaganos**, also known as **Brother Zaganos**, resides in [[Cassomir|Cassomirs]] [[Abbey Green]] district near the east gate, immediately north of [[Quickfall Abbey]]..
> As a member of [[Wildwood Lodge]], he is responsible for maintaining trade relations between the lodge [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of [[Verduran Forest]] and [[Taldor]], and works closely with Cassomir's [[Ship|shipwrights]].
> Despite being fully [[Human|human]], he is rumoured to be over 200 years old. This is believed to be as a result of a [[Magic item|magic brooch]] Zaganos wears at all times. Distrusted by the majority of Cassomir's residents, he is given respect by all because his presence helps ensure a steady supply of [[Blackwood tree|Blackwood]] for the locals.
