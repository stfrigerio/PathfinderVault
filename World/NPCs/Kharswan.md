> **Kharswan** holds the title of Thakur of [[Jalmeray]], and thus is the nominal ruler of that land. In practice, the day-to-day administration is in the hands of the [[Maurya-Rahm]], his vast legion of advisers, and Kharswan has very little actual authority. He spends his days gardening, reading poetry, and setting his advisers against one another.
> Kharswan believes that any who seek or bring [[Magic|magical]] knowledge should be welcome in Jalmeray. However, he has no respect for [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] who use the island to study the 'abomination' of the [[Mana Wastes]], as the blasted Wastes are the antithesis of the magic-enriched island nation. Such researchers are politely encouraged to take their interest elsewhere.
> As of [[4711 AR]], the Thakur is the father of a baby son. He also practices painting as a hobby.
