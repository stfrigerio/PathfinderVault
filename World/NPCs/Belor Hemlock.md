> **Belor Hemlock** is the sheriff of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of [[Sandpoint]]. He replaced the previous sheriff, [[Casp Avertin]], who was killed by serial killer [[Chopper]] in [[4702 AR]].


## Relatives

> Originally a member of the [[ShoantiTribes of the ShoantiShriikirri-Quah|Shriikirri-Quah]] tribe of the [[Shoanti]], Belor abandoned his heritage when he took on the role of sheriff, changing his last name from the [[Shoanti language|Shoanti]] "Viskalai" to its [[Taldane]] translation of "Hemlock", much to the dismay of his brother [[Garridan Viskalai|Garridan]].


## Associates

> Hemlock is romantically involved with [[Kaye Tesarani]], the proprietor of Sandpoint's [[The Pixie's Kitten|local brothel]]. Although this is not public knowledge, it is not as secret an affair as either would like and has further strained the sheriff's relationships with the more conservative and traditional families in town.
> While Belor quietly agrees with the reasoning behind [[Shayliss Vinder|Shrouds]] disruptive activities and stunts, he knows that they will drive some town residents, like the [[House Scarnetti|Scarnettis]], into overreacting.
