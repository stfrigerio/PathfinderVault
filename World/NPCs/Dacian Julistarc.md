> **Dacian Julistarc** is a young [[Human|human]] man and fourth or fifth child of [[House Julistarc]], a [[Noble houses of Cheliax|Chelish noble house]]. In [[4719 AR]], he joined with several childhood friends from rival houses — [[Jasper Caperina]], [[Amyas Charthagnion]], [[Sarevi Tilernos]], and [[Leonie Ciucci]] — on an expedition to the [[Menador Mountains]]. He is an archery fanatic, but presents himself with a level of arrogance notable even among his noble peers.
