> **Soliennu Varshari** is the current Grandmaster Conspiratorial of the [[Seal-Breakers]], and an outcast [[Sczarni]] fortune teller. She is usually absent from her office in the Seal-Breakers' headquarters, preferring to spend time away recruiting and gathering important information. In order to keep her position forever, she plans to allow her captive Olimerea Casterov to turn her into a [[Vampire|vampire]]. [[Kothas|High Grandmaster Kothas]] has promised Soliennu that he will destroy Olimerea after she becomes a vampire, but Soliennu has not yet attained sufficient blackmail material on Kothas to trust him to uphold his end of the bargain, forcing her to store Casterov in solitude.
