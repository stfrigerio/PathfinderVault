> **Karadoon** is a red-eyed [[Griffon|griffon]] with black fur and wicked ebon wings. Its head and the front half of its body resemble that of a great [[Raven|raven]], while its other half resembles that of a lean [[Panther|panther]]. The beast stalks the northern highlands of the [[Five Kings Mountains]] preying on caravans traveling to and from the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] city of [[Tar-Kazmukh]]. Most dwarves recognize Karadoon as a minion of the infamous [[Demon lordNascent demon lords|nascent demon lord]] [[Treerazer]], which escaped from his master's prison in [[Tanglebriar]] to the north. The beast has developed a keen taste for dwarven flesh causing the stout inhabitants, even many of the [[Blue Warders]], to fear straying too far from Tar-Kazmukh's walls.
> Karadoon's taint drives him against his own kindred. It is known that the ebon beast abandons all other prey if he spots another griffon, killing the creature and then devouring it. Sometimes caravan leaders bring along captive griffons and release them to distract the corrupted beast.
