> **Nalt Tarbrow** was a notorious pirate and smuggler who operated from the fortress-island of [[Eel's Skull|Eels Skull]] in the [[Shackles]]. It is said that he stored his treasure in [[Ghol-Gan]] dungeons beneath the island, and that his hoard included several captured artifacts.
> He eventually went mad – possibly as a result of using an artefact called the [[Throne of Nalt]] – and destroyed his fortress.
