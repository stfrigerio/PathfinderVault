> The [[Half-elf|half-elven]] dancer and counter-tenor **Kassiel Iylmrain** is the de facto boss of the [[Triodea]], the well-known [[Magnimar|Magnimarian]] concert hall and theater.  His tirades and promiscuity are well-known throughout the region, and he will do almost anything to advance his career.
