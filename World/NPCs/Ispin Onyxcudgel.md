> **Ispin Onyxcudgel**, known as **The Mosswater Marauder**, was a notorious serial killer who was incarcerated in [[Harrowstone]] prison near [[Ravengro]], in [[Canterwall]] county, [[Ustalav]], where he died in a great fire in [[4661 AR]].


## History

> Ispin had lived with his wife in [[Mosswater]], a town in the north-western [[River Kingdoms]] very close to the border with Ustalav. His murdering spree started as a crime of passion when he murdered his unfaithful wife, whom he had dearly loved, using his hammer to smash her skull. This act sent him mad: he thought that by repairing his wife's skull she would be resurrected which would assuage his guilt. Unfortunately, Ispin could not fully repair the skull—there was a sliver of her skull missing. To find such a sliver to complete the repair, Ispin became the Mosswater Marauder and battered nearly twenty people to death over a few weeks but never found the piece for which he searched. He was eventually caught in the act as he nearly murdered a nobleman's daughter; he was sent directly to Harrowstone the very same night.
