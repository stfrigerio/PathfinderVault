> **General Septimia Arodatus** is the commander of the Sargavan Guard, and the highest-ranking military official in the former [[Cheliax|Chelish]] colony of [[Sargava]]. A fierce proponent of the law, she tired of the [[Rivermen's Guild|Rivermens Guild]] brutal and criminal ways, and decided to simply have its leaders rounded up and executed. Upon finding out that the families of the men she had sent to do this had been abducted, she relented and has confronted the Guild since.
