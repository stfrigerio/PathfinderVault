> **Vespasio Vespam** is the owner of [[Vespam Artisans]] in the [[Old Kintargo]] district of [[Kintargo]]. Vespasio runs Vespam Artisans more like a tinkers' guild than a traditional blacksmith's or metalwork shop and, as such, his business is one of the healthiest to still remain in Old Kintargo.
