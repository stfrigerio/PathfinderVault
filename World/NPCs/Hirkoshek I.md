>  **Pharaoh Hirkoshek I** founded the city of [[An]] in [[Osirion]] in [[-107 AR]] as a permanent establishment of workers and artisans for the construction of his pyramid-tomb. Although his was the first, his pyramid today stands next to those of his dynastic successors, [[Hirkoshek II]], Zahur I, and the infamous [[Kamaria the Brazen]]. Because [[Pharaoh Hirkoshek I's pyramid]] was built so close to a city, his tomb was plundered centuries ago. Despite this, treasure seekers still occasionally explore his pyramid, searching for overlooked treasures.
