> **Baroness Diddima Ennoi** is the head of her noble family, and was once the most ardent critic of the [[Grand Prince]] of [[Taldor]], [[Stavian III]]. She resides in [[Stavian's Hold|Stavians Hold]], a frontier town she was appointed to oversee as a way of blunting her criticism of the crown, and draining her family's resources. She has recently founded a school for [[Alchemy|alchemy]] and [[Arcane magic|arcane magic]], the [[Eastern Front Academy]], in an effort to bolster the new settlement's infrastructure.
