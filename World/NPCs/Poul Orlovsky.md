> **Lord Poul Orlovsky** is head of [[House Orlovsky]] of [[Brevoy]]. He prefers to keep his house above political difficulties, but is running out of time in responding to the disappearance of [[House Rogarvia]]. He has yet to declare allegiance to [[Noleski Surtova]] as anything besides Lord Regent. Soon he will not be able to stall any longer and must either support a king he finds illegitimate or fight to overthrow him.


## Family

> [[Sylvanna Orlovsky]] is Lord Poul Orlovsky's niece. She is the captain of House Orlovsky's forces and the formal representative of her house in the Brevic town of Zmeyka, though often she acts as his ambassador further afield.
