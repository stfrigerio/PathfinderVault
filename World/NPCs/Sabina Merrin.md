> **Sabina Merrin** was the personal bodyguard of [[Ileosa Arabasti|Queen Ileosa Arabasti]] of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city-state of [[Korvosa]], and secretly also her lover. Despite her devotion to the Queen, she eventually turned against her once she realized how ruthless and evil the Queen had become.


## History

> Sabina received her martial training from one of Korvosa's most famous warriors: the weapons master [[Vencarlo Orisini]]. Thanks to a conflict with Vencarlo, engineered by another of Orisini's student, Grau Soldado, Sabina eventually left the school, after a fierce duel with the master left her with a nasty scar on the cheek.
> After leaving the school, Sabina entered the [[Korvosan Guard]], where she quickly climbed the ranks. It was while serving in the Guard that she caught the Queen's eye, who soon had Sabina made her personal bodyguard. Sabina idolized the young queen for her strength and ambition, not knowing that this was a result of the influence of the spirit of [[Kazavon]].
