## Gift to the Pathfinder Society

> Forest King Narven gifted a [[Magic|magical]] hedge maze to the [[Pathfinder Society]] approximately 200 years ago, growing it from the ground up on the lawn of the [[Galt|Galtan]] [[Woodsedge Lodge]]. The [[Maze of the Open Road]] contains magical [[Teleportation|teleportation]] portals, used in times past by the [[Decemvirate]] to travel to the lodge for meetings. Narven planted additional portals within the Maze that brought in strange beasts as time went on, making it dangerous to traverse its paths.
