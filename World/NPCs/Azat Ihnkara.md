> **Azat Ihnkara** is a member of the aristocratic [[Ihnkara family]] and also serves as one of the ruling [[Water Lord Ular Kel|Water Lords]] of [[Ular Kel]]. The position as one of the Water Lords belongs to whoever currently controls one of the three [[Water Houses]] that dominate the city. While this system sounds unstable, in reality, the title normally remains within the aristocratic families like the Ihnkara who pass the title down along familial lines.
