> **Teacher** is the name given to the person or entity that was responsible for the teachings of the religious sect known as the [[Iridian Fold]]. In [[3789 AR]], the two men who would come to be known as Teacher wandered out of the [[Grass Sea]] and into the city of [[Ular Kel]]. Chained together, this pair moved and spoke in perfect unison as if they were one [[Soul|soul]] split across two bodies, what the Iridian Fold refers to as *szerik*. Together, they sought out an audience with the reigning [[Water Lord Ular Kel|Water Lords]] who ruled the city. As rulers of Ular Kel, none of the Water Lords was inclined to grant an audience to these penniless travellers (who were assumed to be escaped [[Slave|slaves]] due to their chains). So, Teacher waited at the bottom of each of the [[Water Houses]] (which serve the Water Lords as home) for eight hours a day. The Water Lords sent their guards to remove these vagabonds from their property but, despite being completely unarmed, Teacher managed to overcome every single guard that the Water Lords threw at them.
> Eventually, the son of one of the Water Lords (along with his lover) came to watch the pair defeat his father's guards. When the son asked Teacher what they wanted, they replied "Only to teach you". This pair, [[Mitrae the Wise]] and [[Loyeru Shieldbreaker]], became Teacher's first disciples. Teacher remained in Ular Kel for a decade passing on the teachings that would become the Iridian Fold before walking back into the Grass Sea in [[3799 AR]], never to be seen again.
