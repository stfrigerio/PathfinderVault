> **Khalib** was the most powerful apprentice of [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Karzoug]].


## Background

> Khalib was the best student of [[Magic|magic]] in his school, and was chosen as one of Karzoug's apprentices. Due to his power and ambition, Khalib rose quickly above the others and started to call himself First Apprentice. He also had ambitions of replacing Karzoug as runelord of greed when his master waned in power.
> When [[Earthfall]] happened, Khalib entered stasis along with his master. Karzoug planned for Khalib's stasis to automatically end after 100 years so he could awaken him, but his other apprentices, who did not want Karzoug to come back, altered the timer on Khalib's stasis so he would never awaken barring external intervention.
> [[4702 AR|Ten millennia later]], [[Mokmurian]] awakened Karzoug, finishing the job Khalib failed to do. Karzoug was disappointed in his apprentice's failure and considered not waking him, but later decided that he needed all the help he could and woke Khalib.
