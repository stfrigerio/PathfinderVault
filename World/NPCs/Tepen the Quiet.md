> [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu]] **Tepen the Quiet** is the carpenter of the [[Ship|frigate]] *[[Red Courage]]* and the only crew member who escapes [[Sweet Wilihem Poore|Captain Sweet Wilihem Poores]] fury. The ill-tempered captain calls Tepen his "feathery good luck charm" and allows him a number of privileges that cause the grumbling of other crew members.
