**Backstory**: Eadric was once a student at Promise Academy, known for his humor and lightheartedness. His jests and pranks brought joy to his peers and lightened the otherwise serious atmosphere of the academy. However, underneath the façade of the jovial jester was a young man grappling with the existential questions of life and the nature of reality.

Hailing from a humble background, Eadric had always felt out of place among the scholars of Promise Academy. He found solace not in the study of magic or history, but in philosophy, seeking answers to the questions that kept him awake at night. His fascination with metaphysical concepts became an obsession, especially the idea of the thin veil separating life and death.

In his pursuit of understanding, Eadric stumbled upon an obscure philosophical text in the academy's library: "The Paradox of the Spectral Self." The book proposed a theory that through a certain state of consciousness, one could exist in both the realm of the living and the dead, essentially becoming a ghost in life.

Eadric, driven by curiosity and a desire to understand this phenomenon, decided to conduct a forbidden ritual described in the text. The ritual, however, was less about magic and more about reaching a certain mental and emotional state. He isolated himself, meditating intensely and pushing his mind and body to its limits.

In the end, Eadric managed to cross the veil, his consciousness slipping into the spectral realm while his body remained in the world of the living. He became a living ghost, a creature both of this world and beyond. However, the ritual left him trapped in this state, unable to return fully to the world of the living or move on to the afterlife.
    
**Request to the players**: Eadric seeks the players' help to reverse his spectral condition and return to the world of the living. They must delve deep into philosophical and metaphysical studies, discover the truth about Eadric's experiment, and find a way to bring his consciousness back to his body.

## Self

Eadric's story adds a philosophical depth to the campaign and can lead to intriguing discussions about life, death, and the nature of existence. The task of helping Eadric also presents a unique challenge, requiring the players to use their minds and reasoning skills rather than brute force or magic.

**The Truth About Eadric's Experiment**: The book "The Paradox of the Spectral Self" was written by a philosopher-wizard who sought to understand the nature of existence. The ritual Eadric performed wasn't so much a spell as it was a psychological exercise to alter his perception of reality. However, the book failed to mention that once the veil between life and death is breached in this manner, returning is not straightforward and requires an act of self-realization and acceptance of one's true state of being. 

**Helping Eadric**: The players must first uncover the nature of Eadric's predicament, realizing that the solution isn't in the realm of magic but philosophy and psychology. They would need to engage with Eadric in deep philosophical discussions, questioning the nature of life, death, and existence. The aim would be to guide Eadric towards self-realization, to understand that he has trapped himself in this spectral state through his own perception. To aid in this journey, the players could seek out further works by the author of "The Paradox of the Spectral Self" or consult scholars of metaphysics. They might also need to employ magic or rituals designed to reach into Eadric's mind, to guide and support him in his journey of self-realization.
    
    
**Final Choice**: The climax of Eadric's story comes when he is on the brink of understanding, and the players have done all they can to guide him. Eadric will need to make the final leap himself. At this point, the players are presented with a choice: 

- **Help Eadric Return to Life**: If the players have grown fond of Eadric and wish to see him return to the world of the living, they can try to convince him that life, despite its hardships and existential questions, is worth living. This path could involve reminding Eadric of the joys of life, the bonds he formed at the academy, and the potential for growth and learning that life offers. 
- **Help Eadric Pass On**: If the players believe that Eadric would find peace in the afterlife, they can guide him to accept his death and move on. This could involve helping Eadric come to terms with the fact that some questions may never have answers, and that it's okay to let go and find peace in the unknown.

The final choice depends on the players' judgment and their relationship with Eadric. Regardless of their choice, helping Eadric confront his existential crisis and find resolution provides a unique, memorable, and emotional experience that deepens the players' involvement in the world of Promise Academy.
