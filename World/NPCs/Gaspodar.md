>  **King Gaspodar** was the last ruler of the [[Chelaxian Empire]] before the [[Chelish Civil War]] brought the [[diabolically-supported]] [[House Thrune]] to the throne. A believer in the [[Starfall Doctrine]], he had prepared to surrender his crown to the prophesied manifestation of [[Aroden]].
>  It was by King Gaspodar's command that the [[knightly]] orders, later named [[Hellknights]], came into being in [[4576 AR]]. Pleased with their efforts, he funded the restoration of [[Fort Rivad]] to serve as the knight's permanent home.
>  With Aroden's death in [[4606 AR]] and the eruption of civil war, Gaspodar ordered Hellknights to [[Molthune]] and [[Andoran]] to keep order in [[4607 AR]]. By [[4616 AR]], the successes of the knights led the now desperate king to mandate additional orders without consulting the existing [[lictors]].
>  Growing increasingly paranoid of assassination attempts on his own life, he sanctioned the [[Order of the Scar]] for the specific purpose of overseeing his well-being. The Hellknights successfully thwarted more than 40 assassination attempts, two of which originated from the king's own family. However, in [[Neth]] of [[4622 AR]], Gaspodar, by now senile, was mysteriously slain in what had been considered a safe area of [[Korradath]], his palace in [[Westcrown]], despite his Hellknight protectors being only rooms away. His left ring finger and royal seal were never found.
