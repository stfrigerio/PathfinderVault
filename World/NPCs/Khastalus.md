> **Khastalus of Corentyn** was a [[Taldor|Taldan]] general who fought a bloody campaign against the native [[Human|human]] and [[Fey|fey]] tribes of the [[Arthfell Forest]] during the turn of the 18th century [[AR]]. Once the native groups had been defeated, Khastalus was placed in charge of the new Taldan province of [[Andoran]] in [[1707 AR]], and he founded the port city of [[Augustana]] the same year.


## History

> Khastalus' successes against the native humans and fey allowed the Taldan colonists to begin logging the Arthfell Forest for its valuable lumber. By [[1750 AR]], nearly all of Taldor's naval vessels were built of wood from the Arthfell.
