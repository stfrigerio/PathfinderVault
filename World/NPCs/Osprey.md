> The [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] **Osprey** is a member of the [[Pathfinder Society]], although he tends to work outside of the organization's standard hierarchical framework. He gets his name from his habit of wildshaping into dark-eyed raptors.
> The enigmatic [[Pathfinder]] is rumored to be writing a secret report that he guards jealously; only bits of it have been fed to the [[Decemvirate]].  Osprey is known to be an expert on the [[Kortos Consortium]] and their activities in [[Absalom]] and its sister-city, [[Diobel]], most likely because he is a native of the [[Diobel|latter settlement]].


## Appearance

> Osprey appears to be in his late forties, with dark hair and a shadow of a beard. His light eyes are piercing, perhaps even haunting.
