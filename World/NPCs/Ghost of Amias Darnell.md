Amias Darnell's death is indeed shrouded in more mystery than he himself understands. In his spectral haze, he recalls it as a tragic accident, a consequence of his group's exploration of forbidden magic. However, the truth is far darker and lies at the heart of the ghostly disturbances at Promise Academy. 

**True Backstory**: Amias and his group of friends were not merely experimenting with forbidden magic; they were lured into a treacherous plot by a malevolent entity, possibly the same entity now manipulating the unrestful spirits in the academy. This entity, under the guise of a benevolent mentor, encouraged the students to perform a ritual that they believed would unlock unparalleled magical power. 

However, the ritual was actually a sacrificial rite designed to bolster the entity's own power. The so-called "mentor" deceived the students, and the ritual resulted in their violent deaths, with Amias' death being the culmination of the sacrifice.

**Connection to the Grimoire and Unfinished Business**: Amias' grimoire is not just a record of his magical studies. Unbeknownst to him, it also contains the true details of the sacrificial ritual, including the entity's true name and the method to reverse the ritual. The "mentor" had tricked Amias into recording these details, intending to use them for his own ends but never did due to the unexpected aftermath of the ritual.

Haunted by his unfinished business and the lingering trauma of his death, Amias seeks closure and redemption. He intuitively feels that his grimoire holds the key to his peace, but he does not fully understand its significance. 

By recovering the grimoire and deciphering its secrets, the players can not only help Amias find peace but also reveal the truth behind the haunting of Promise Academy. They could potentially use the information in the grimoire to confront and defeat the malevolent entity, bringing peace to all the restless spirits and the academy itself.
