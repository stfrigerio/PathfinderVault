> **Natalya Vancaskerkin** is the first-born, but disowned, daughter of [[Riddleport]]'s infamous [[Saul Vancaskerkin]]. Her mother, Adreea Valitrosa, died while the new family tried to escape Riddleport ahead of her [[Sczarni]] family. They did not approve of the marriage and wanted Natalya as payment.
> Feeling alienated from her father and second step-mother, Natalya turned to a Sczarni crime family that was a rival of her father's. Once discovered by her father, she was kicked out of the family manor, never to return.
> Heading to [[Magnimar]], Natalya joined up with another Sczarni gang, the [[Tower Girls]]. Unhappy with not being in charge and the amount of money she was forced to contribute to the Sczarni, she approached [[Sheila Heidmarch]] of the [[Pathfinder Society]] about becoming an informant.
> Heidmarch lost contact with Natalya shortly after Natalya indicated she and the Sczarni had found an item that would be of use to the Society. Heidmarch has learned that the Sczarni are also searching for Natalya, so she suspects Natalya has fled with the item.
