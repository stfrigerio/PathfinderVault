> **Chask Haladan** is the owner of [[The Curious Goblin]], an excellent bookshop in the town of [[Sandpoint]] in [[Varisia]]. During his earlier years, Chask was an adventurer; the funds he earned early in life ensure the continued operation of his shop. His books are too pricey for the locals but Chask has had a love affair with books for nearly 70 years and his bookstore is surprisingly complete. Chask seems to consider the gathering of his tomes more important than succeeding at business.
