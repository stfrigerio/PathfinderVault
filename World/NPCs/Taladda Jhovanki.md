> **Councilor Taladda Jhovanki** is a landowner who also sits on the Palatine Council of Canterwall and is known as a very capable orator with a passion for regional security. He lashes into anyone taking liberal views as lax and treacherous and this stance has meant the rigidity of rule in Tamrivena is strong, such that freedoms held elsewhere in [[Ustalav]] are banned in the county.
