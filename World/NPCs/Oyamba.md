> **High Sun-Mage Oyamba** is the master of the [[Magaambya]], the school of [[Magic|magic]] located in [[Nantambu]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]], and one of the leaders of the [[Tempest-Sun Mages]] who protect the Magaambya from the air.


## Background

> Oyamba gained his position after successfully leading the defense of the Magaambya against an army of [[Ape|apes]] from [[Usaro]].


## Current position

> Oyamba is frustrated by his role as the head of the Magaambya, which is mostly diplomatic and bureaucratic. He'd rather be doing "legitimate research" or directly opposing the forces of [[Evil|evil]], but has to trust that the students he trains and oversees will be up to the task instead.
