> **Genedair the Faithful** worked into his late nineties as high priest of the [[Seventh Church]], the large temple of [[Iomedae]] in the [[Ascendant Court]] district of [[Absalom]]. He retired some time after the [[Fiendflesh Siege]] and the promotion of [[Wynsal Starborn]] to acting [[Primarch|primarch]] of Absalom in [[4719 AR]]; he died soon thereafter. He was succeeded as high priest by [[Tavorae Falsebane]]. As a younger man, he was a hero of the [[Mendevian Crusades]], but required the assistance of two young acolytes to walk in his later years, though his mind never failed him.
