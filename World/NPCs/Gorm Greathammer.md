*This article covers the head of the [[Grand Archive faction]] of the [[Pathfinder Society]]. For the [[Absalom|Absalomian]] tavernkeeper known as "Fat Gorm", see [[Gorm]].*
> **Prince Gorm Greathammer** leads the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[Sky Citadel]] of [[Kraggodan]]. In addition to being an open-minded and welcoming monarch, he is also a famous [[Pathfinder]].


## Background

> Gorm is third in line to Kraggodan's throne but has long favoured the adventuring lifestyle, joining the [[Pathfinder Society]] decades ago and has since distinguished himself as an explorer and chronicler. He nevertheless took a leave of absence to return to Kraggodan to negotiate peace with [[Molthune]] during the Ironfang Invasion and returns periodically to help administer the Sky Citadel.
