> **Otok** was the chief of the village of [[Bacul Gruii]] in the small kingdom of [[Cordelon]] in the area of the [[River Kingdoms]]. The village was taken over by Petchki, a foreign merchant, who enslaved the locals to harvest wood and livestock for his band of mercenaries. Petchki's men slew Otok and mounted his head in the town square to keep the villagers afraid. To legitimize his rule over Bacul Gruii, the mercenary captain plans to marry one of Otok's daughters and declare himself the new village chief.
