> **Count Haserton Lowls IV** is a dislikeable person; he is insular, unfriendly, and does not care at all about his citizens or the running of [[Versex]], even resenting them for the constant demands they put on his time. Instead of running one of the most prosperous counties in all of [[Ustalav]], he has given local rulers like mayors or magistrates more power while confining himself to his estate. Within his mansion, Haserton haunts the ever growing stacks of [[Book|books]] and manuscripts that comprise his library, and grows ever more obsessed with his own amateurish and deeply disturbing attempts at poetry and [[Art|art]]. He also spends considerable resources patronizing the fields of the arts and [[Science|sciences]], including [[Metaphysics|metaphysics]].
