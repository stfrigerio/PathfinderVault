## Childhood
> Born in [[Promise]] from distinguished artists Menandros Swiftbrush and Gwynever Ertas, Gwendolyn studied at home under the scrupolous guidance of his father. Her attitude was clear since her earliest years, leaving no doubt about her future. When she turned ten she began her apprenticeship in her father's workshop, learning everything about pigments, paints, perspective and all things related. She never doubted even for a moment and kept practicing, driven by a strong love for the arts and culture. By the time she turned sixteen she was more than ready to face her citizenship test, which she passed with flying colours. [[Mengkare]] was extremely pleased with the young painter's efforts and kept a close eye on her.
## The first Shop
>As soon as she was done with her trial she received a convocation to appear before the [[Council of Enlightenment]]. [[Mengkare]] spent words of great appreciation and entitled her to a newly built artisan's workshop, instructing her to perfect her art and worry about nothing else. 
>Filled with pride and purpose, the young bard left her father's workshop behind and set out on her own, working tirelessy on her skills, spending countless days locked inside the workshop, allowing only the occasional visits from the golden dragon himself.
>After two years of crazed work she managed to produce her first great painting "The dawn at the womb of hopes", depicting an idyllic scene of early morning myst engulfing a somewhat younger [[Mengkare]] as he was overseeing the building of the Golden Citadel.
>With this painting Gwendolyn managed to win the first of several Golden Endeavour awards.
>In the subsequent years she kept refining her arts, living as a recluse and developing an intimate friendship with the Golden ruler of the city.
## The School of the Golden Arts
>It then came a time, once the bard had grown in an affirmed young woman, when [[Mengkare]] officialy called upon her once again. In the halls of the Golden Citadel, the [[Council of Enlightenment]] formally asked the bard that she opened a school, as to form other in her craft, and perpretate her excellence.
>As was expected of her, she solemnly accepted.
>For a year and little more her activity as an artist alted, as she oversaw the edification of the School of Golden Arts in the [[Artist District]] of [[Promise]]. Her efforts, conjoined with the great artisans that were sent to help and with the everseeing eye of [[Mengkare]], resulted in a magnificent building made of white marble, withe golden doors and windows and a huge rooftop terrace, explicitly thought as a landing spot for the golden dragon.
>The school quickly became the prominent center for the learning of the fine arts in the city, overwhelming the young woman with great loads of work.
## Teaching
>Ever the artist, never a socialite, Gwendolyn found herself in the difficult shoes of the teacher. She teaches with great effort, never sparing herself, nor her time. On the other hands some say  that her newfound vocation cast a shadow on her soul. Her works of art, still masterpieces mostly, came sparser and sparser, with increasing time between the one and the other.
>Notable critics also pointed out how her later works lost some of the golden light she used to infuse in every painting and became a tad darker. Many say this is a sign of maturation and the simple reflection of a more complex mind than that of an adolescent, other think that craks are showing in her paintings, through which a darkness can be seen in her soul.
>Nevertheless Gwendolyn managed to win prestigious awards even during her time as headmistress of the school. In time she also learnt to delegate, introducing other teachers in the school, which now offers a varied curriculum, spanning from painting to dancing, acting and other arts.
>Rumors have it that [[Mengkare]] doesn't visit the terrace rooftop as much as he used to in the first years of the school.

> [!question] Open questions for the Master:
> 1. How did Gwendolyn's father felt about being surclassed by his daughter?
> 2. What kind of relation did young Gwendolyn had with Mengkare?
> 3. Did Gwendolyn want to open the school, or did she accept out of duty?
> 4. Is running the school posing a burden on the artist?
> 5. Has something happened between her and the dragon?
