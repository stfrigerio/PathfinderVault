> **Sir Aurek Roderic** was the founder of the port town of [[Roderic's Cove|Roderics Cove]] in [[Varisia]]. Around [[4638 AR]], the privateer Sir Roderic led a group of emigrants from [[Magnimar]] to found the port town. In the years after the town's founding, he protected the town, fighting against the predations of [[Riddleport|Riddleports]] [[Pirate|pirates]]. He sailed the [[Varisian Gulf]], thwarting raiders, and these actions earned him Riddleport's ire. Ten years after the founding of Roderic's Cove (around [[4648 AR]]), a group of pirates from Riddleport finally caught Sir Roderic out sailing with his family and sank his [[Ship|ship]] in full view of the Cove's populace.
> Sir Roderic was also an accomplished cartographer. He created numerous maps of the gulf and the rivers he explored that fed into it. These maps now reside in [[Cove Hall]] in the town's archives.
