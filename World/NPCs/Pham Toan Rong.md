> **Pham Toan Rong** was the first [[Dragon King]] of [[Xa Hoi]], the so-called "Empire of the Dragon". Exactly how a [[Sovereign dragon|sovereign dragon]] came to rule this nation has been lost to time and is one of [[Tian Xia|Tian Xias]] most enduring mysteries, but it is known that the nation was formed in [[-1987 AR|513 IC]]. What is known is that from Pham Toan Rong's rule descended a line of sovereign dragon kings that has ruled Xa Hoi ever since and that the previous kings are held in the highest possible esteem by the land's inhabitants.
