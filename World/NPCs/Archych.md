> **Lord Archych of House Dureanz** is a merchant and the owner of the [[Devil's Own|Devils Own]] shipyard in the [[Docks]] district of the city of [[Absalom]]. His shipyard specializes in [[Ship|war galleys]] used by Absalom's navy and sold to the markets throughout the [[Inner Sea]]. Lord Archych, a loyal [[Cheliax|Chelaxian]], employs the worst thugs and pushes around his considerable weight at every opportunity. The machinations of Lord Archych and those of his rival [[Goodmiss Alidane of House Candren]], manager of the [[Sea King Shipyard]], are the main source of intrigue and violence in the Docks.
