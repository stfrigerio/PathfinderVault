> **Zachrin Vhast** is the current high priest of [[Songbird Hall]], a temple devoted to [[Shelyn]] in the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Kintargo]], and the only [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|good-aligned]] temple openly allowed in the city. As high priest, Zachrin has to walk a delicate line between trying to mitigate the tyrannical [[House Thrune|Thrune]] control of the city and pacifying the often violent rebels who opposed it. The efforts of Zachrin Vhasts's congregation have helped to maintain Kintargo's tradition as a haven for [[Art|artists]] and creativity even with Cheliax's new [[Devil|devil]]-backed leaders, but this has meant advocating against outright rebellion and the inevitable bloodshed it would bring. Still, this is an easy life compared to Zachrin Vhast's previous role performing illegal Shelyn-blessed marriages in shadowy [[Nidal]] where being caught would have meant death.
