> **Mahadev** is a [[Garuda|garuda]] [[Monk|monk]] who meditates near the peak of [[Gyanpad]] in the [[Lohaparbat Mountains]] of [[Vudra]]. Mahadev has been meditating for over a decade now and a small cult has formed, dedicated to keeping Mahadev's physical form nourished and alive. His followers claim that Mahadev has already ascended to a higher plane of existence and some of his followers believe that he is in the process of becoming a true [[Deity|deity]]. Unfortunately, Mahadev's psychic emanations have inadvertently attracted monstrous [[Yeti|yetis]] and even more deadly [[Wendigo|wendigos]] to Gyanpad and the surrounding area.
