> **Orynox Marchelin** is the ruler of the [[Fire giant|fire giant]] realm of [[Kragnaroth]] in the [[Mindspin Mountains]], east of [[Varisia]]. He has reigned Kragnaroth since his father's death in [[4631 AR]] and has been recognized as one of the finest and most brutal kings yet. He is a fierce and ruthless warlord. He has killed no fewer than five of his own wives but still all fire giantesses within the kingdom swoon over the chance to marry him. His latest queen is [[Hregana Marchelin|Hregana]], a great warrior who traveled from distant lands to the south to seek Orynox's hand in marriage. The king seems to be especially preoccupied by her. Orynox plans to expand Kragnaroth across the Mindspin Mountains both south and east.
