> **Xanae** is a [[Cyclops|cyclops]] seer who dwells on the island of [[Butcher's Rock|Butchers Rock]] within [[Shackles|the Shackles]]. Standing nine feet tall, Xanae has nut brown skin, covered with scars and her nearly bald head boasts only the few wisps of gray hair left on it. Xanae normally wears only a collection of rags and lives in a cave near the beach of Butcher's Rock; she lives in exile from the other cyclopes that share the island. Xanae previously lived on [[Undersquare Isle]] and was there when it was attacked by the [[Pirate|pirate]] captain [[Seagrave]] while he was searching for [[Ghol-Gan]] treasure. Like many of the so-called 'high cyclopes', Xanae possesses prophetic vision, predicting that the [[Pathfinder]] captain [[Challys Argent]] will die at the hands of one of the members of the [[Devil's Four|Devils Four]].
