> The **Sultana Ashadieeyah bint Khalid** is the ruler of the [[Shaitan|shaitan]] [[Genie|genies]]. She lives in the Rainbow Metropolis of the [[Opaline Vault]], capital of the Peerless Empire on the Elemental [[Plane of Earth]]. She has [[Gold|golden]] skin. The mining and mercantile interests in the Opaline Vault are efficiently managed by the sultana; each craft guild's [[Pasha|pasha]] serves her.
> She has ruled the shaitans for 500 years, since her father was killed by [[Efreet|efreet]] from the [[Plane of Fire]]. Under her rule, the shaitan have prospered, and have developed trade routes to the [[Plane of Water]]. However, her abiding goal is the destruction of the efreet. All of the shaitans' wealth is spent making [[Weapon|weapons]] and hiring mercenaries for war on the efreet, and her foreign policy centres around gaining allies in the conflict—from mercenary [[Janni|jann]] to [[Fire mephit|fire mephits]].
> It is whispered that she needs to win the war soon, otherwise shaitan society will collapse under the strain of the war effort.
