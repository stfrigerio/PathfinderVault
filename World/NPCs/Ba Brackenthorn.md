> **Ba Brackenthorn**, known to most simply as **Ba**, was a founding member of the [[Silver Ravens]] who protected [[Kintargo]] during the [[CheliaxHistory|Chelish Civil War]]. Ba served as a strong moral compass for the Silver Ravens which, in the end, cost him his life. He survived both [[Amyreid]] and [[Kyda]] who were assassinated by the [[Pit fiend|pit fiend]] Oughorthan while performing the "Song of Silver" in [[4640 AR]]. Ba was forced underground while [[House Thrune]] consolidated its hold over Kintargo, but hoped to be able to rise up against them. Sadly, he was killed in [[4644 AR]] by a fellow Silver Raven, the hotheaded [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|ranger]] [[Brakisi]], when he refused to help kidnap the Thrune-backed mayor's young son.
