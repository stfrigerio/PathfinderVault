> **Gendowyn** is once again the queen of the [[Fey|fey]] [[Accressiel Court]] in the [[Fangwood 1]], where she fights to eliminate what remains of the [[Darkblight]].



## History

> Gendowyn founded the Accressiel Court In [[-3852 AR]]. She claims to have planted the first seedling in the Fangwood when she left the [[First World]] for the shores of [[Lake Encarthan]], although this story cannot be verified due to the fey's tendency to exaggerate. The local [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and [[Kellid|Kellids]] sought to exploit the Fangwood's resources, but were driven away by Gendowyn's guile and trickery. In [[-3701 AR]], she reached out to them and formed strong alliances.
> In [[2506 AR]], after [[Treerazer]] killed Hephloma, guardian of the [[Fierani Forest]], Gendowyn gathered an army to march against him. Her troops managed to inflict heavy casualties and stole the *Spiteful Scimitar*, but were ultimately turned back after she received several festering wounds that took decades to heal. This incident left Gendowyn less willing to fight and more distrustful of outsiders. In [[3203 AR]], in the face of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrants]] onslaught, she ignored the Kellids when they came to beseech her aid, overturning an alliance that had lasted nearly 7,000 years. She had the court retreat deeper in the forest, insisting on remaining neutral. Nevertheless, she felt a pang of guilt over the thousands killed by the Tyrant.
> In [[3981 AR]], Gendowyn saw the respect and deference of the dwarves of [[Kraggodan]], when they came to seek out her advice on safety after [[Droskar's Crag|Droskars Crag]] erupted. She happily told them that the [[Mindspin Mountains]] were not [[Volcano|volcanic]], and offered them an alliance sealed by her sceptre, the *Dryad's Song*, assuring them that they were welcome as long as she ruled over the Fangwood.
> As the friendship between dwarves and fey grew greater, Gendowyn's handmaiden [[Arlantia]] seethed under what she saw as favouritism. In [[4062 AR]], she betrayed her mistress with an army of fey she [[Blighted fey|blighted]] with the Darkblight. Gendowyn demanded Arlantia renounce her [[Evil|evil]] and displayed her might by [[Magic/Conjuration|conjuring]] a terrible storm over Arlantia's tree, unknown that the handmaiden had used her access to Gendowyn's chambers to corrupt *Dryad's Song*. In using th corrupted sceptre, Gendowyn unleashed a [[Magic|magical]] feedback that weakened her, allowing Arlantia to imprison her.
> In [[4717 AR]], [[Nirmathas|Nirmathi]] militia leaders eradicated the Darkblight, killed Arlantia, and freed Gendowyn from her imprisonment; she now rules over the Accressial Court again.


## Associates

> Knowing that even with Arlantia gone, her rule is far from secure due to remnants of the Darkblight and various threats infesting the northern Fangwood, Gendowyn has established relations with Nirmathas, particularly the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of [[Crystalhurst]] and the [[Chernasardo Rangers]].


## Cults

> Many of Gendowyn's handmaidens are [[Cleric|clerics]] and [[Inquisitor|inquisitors]] who worship and draw [[Divine magic|power]] from her.
