> **King Wen** is the current ruler of the [[Successor States|Successor State]] of [[Quain]] in [[Tian Xia]]. Unlike many other kings, King Wen desires daughters rather than sons, for only a royal maiden can complete the Ceremony of the Celestial Dragon and exchange her heart for a Celestial Pearl, which has the power to grant a single *wish*. The last time a king of Quain was unable to obtain the Celestial Pearl (when the ceremony was disrupted by [[Burning Cloud Devil]]) Quain suffered 12 years of natural calamities and other misfortunes. King Wen claims to be in possession of a 93-foot-long scroll that proves his direct descent from [[Mu Lung]], the mythical first emperor of the [[Tian human ethnicity|Tian people]] 11,000 years ago.
