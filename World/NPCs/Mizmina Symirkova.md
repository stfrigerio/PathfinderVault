> **Mizmina Symirkova** is the daughter of [[Vammiera Symirkova|Lady Vammiera Symirkova]] and as such the *de facto* second in command of the infamous [[Magnimar]] gang known as [[The Gargoyles]]. While her mother controls the gang from behind the scenes, Mizmina often leads the gang on their most audacious thefts and is part of the reason for the gang's reputation as peerless cat burglars. Mizmina herself is a cold woman, often even described as icy, she posseses great skill in the [[Rogue|roguish]] arts for one so young, as Mizmina is only just eighteen.
