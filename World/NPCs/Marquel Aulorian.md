> **Marquel Aulorian** is a scion of the aristocratic [[House Aulorian]] and, unbeknownst to his family, is also secretly the radical poet known as the Poison Pen of [[Kintargo]].


## Appearance

> Marquel is a young man with dark brown hair that frames a slightly soft but still very fine face. Garbed in fine aristocratic clothing Marquel has a withered arm that he tends to hide beneath his shirt as he is rather self-conscious about it.


## History

> Marquel and his father, the House Aulorian patriarch, [[Auxis Aulorian|Auxis]], have drifted apart as his father's growing loyalty to [[House Thrune]] has driven a wedge between them. Auxis fears that Marquel has got himself tangled up with the [[Silver Ravens]] but the truth is far more scandalous: he is the outlawed Poison Pen of Kintargo, a notorious rebel poet and virulent critic of all things Thrune. Marquel's other secret is his lover [[Cassius Sargaeta]], the captain of the [[Chelish Navy]] vessel *[[Scourge of Belial]]*.
