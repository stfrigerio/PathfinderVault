## Appearance

> Even for an ogre, Otondo is a hulking mound of flesh, out weighing three people combined. His face is brutal looking with a protruding brow above his small, dead black eyes. The top of his head seems small in comparison to his large jaw and blunt yet lethal teeth. Otondo's body is rippled with muscle, his veins stand out against his skin a grey-green tone. He wears a pair of large, shaggy boots and wields an enormous cutlass forged specifically for him.
