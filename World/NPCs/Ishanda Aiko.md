> **Ishanda Aiko** was a general of the ancient [[Teikoku|Teikoku Shogunate]]. She is most famous for her ill-fated expedition along the [[Ghost Path]] in [[470 AR]]. Starting out at [[Mount Kumijinja]] in the [[Kamifushi Mountains]], she led an army deep into the depths of [[Sekamina]] in the [[Darklands]], reaching as far as the [[Oni|oni]] city of [[Shirogoku]] beneath the [[Forest of Spirits]]. Here, her army was slaughtered by the vicious oni and Ishanda herself retreated back up the Ghost Path to warn those above of the terrible things she had discovered beneath [[Tian Xia]]'s surface.
