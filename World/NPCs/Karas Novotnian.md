> **Karas "the Falcon" Novotnian**, and several friends, with assistance from the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] military, established a fort in the wilderness area known as [[Darkmoon Vale]] (in what is now northern [[Andoran]]) in [[4113 AR]], and began to take control of the region from the native [[Kellid]] tribes in the name of the Empire of Cheliax. In [[4117 AR]], Karas was awarded the title of Baron of Darkmoon by the Emperor of Cheliax for his efforts to bring Darkmoon Vale into the empire; this title survived for nearly six centuries.
> People referred to Karas and his descendants as the "Falcon" because of the prominent [[Falcon|falcon]] on the crest of Baron Novotnian's [[Heraldry|heraldic display]]. This was the true origin of the "falcon" in so many names in Andoran. Even with the death of the last Falcon-Baron Novotnian and the eradication of nobility in Andoran, the people continue to embrace the imagery and iconography of the bird.
