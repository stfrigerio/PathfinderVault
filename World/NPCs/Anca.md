> Daughter to [[Zandros]] the Fair, leader of the [[Goatherds]] gang in [[Egorian]], **Anca** will not cross her father. She has buck teeth, like her father, but that is the only major resemblance. She wears whatever fake jewelry strikes her fancy at market, but also has amassed a few pieces of real jewelry from those willing to court her despite her father's vigilant and protective stance towards these suitors. One of these men is Scipio who works at the [[Bunyip Dock]].
