> According to [[Jistka Imperium|Jistkan]] hagiography, **Arustun** and his older brother [[Ejanos]] rediscovered the [[Azlant|Azlanti]] treasures in the [[Cave of Tiandra]] in approximately [[-4160 AR]]. Ejanos wanted to burn the strange scrolls as fuel but Arustun, knowing that these relics were important, contested his brother's claim to them and inadvertently killed him. With Ejanos' death, Arustun suddenly gained the ability to understand the writings and quickly absorbed these sparse treasures of Azlanti lore while in the cave.
> Arustun, with his wife [[Mirnura person|Mirnura]] and his friend [[Venistos]], crafted a [[Ship|ship]] for himself and his favored companions and traveled the [[Inner Sea]] for years from shore to shore searching for knowledge that could enhance what he had learned from the Azlanti relics in the Cave of Tiandra. His travels took him far across the lands of [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]], from the shadow-bound warrior-lords of ancient [[Nidal]] to the magnificent [[Sky Citadel|Sky Citadels]] of the [[Dwarf|dwarves]]. Arustun recruited numerous allies in his quest of civilization and recorded everything he saw and learned in his extensive journals, later to be collectively known as the *[[Poleiheira]]*. After his journeys around the Inner Sea, Arustun—using the forgotten [[Magic|magic]] of fallen Azlant and [[Thassilon]] that he had learned—managed to travel the [[Great Beyond|planes]], most notably the [[Axis|Eternal City of Axis]]. While he was in Axis, Arustun finalized his plans to found the empire he envisioned.
> He returned home from his odyssey in [[-4120 AR]] with many foreign associates and allies. He founded the Jistka Imperium in northwestern Garund and named the capital after his beloved wife, who had remained behind for all the years of his absence helping their people.
> The Jistka Imperium was the first [[Human|human]] civilization to emerge since the [[Golarion|Golarion-wide]] destruction caused by [[Earthfall]].
