> At one time, the [[Elf|elves]] had a small stronghold in northern [[Ustalav]]. It was established to guard the [[Lichgate]], the last remaining [[Elf gate|elf gate]] that linked to the [[Demon|demon]]-corrupted [[Tanglebriar]].
> The garrison's purpose was intended to be purely defensive, but its commander, an elf called **Elledariah**, saw an opportunity to establish a base within Tanglebriar and take the war to the demons. Unfortunately, this plan enabled a [[Succubus|succubus]] to infiltrate the elven forces, and ultimately to influence them such that they became introverted and paranoid. 
> Under the demon's influence, the garrison stopped keeping in contact with the main elven forces in [[Kyonin]] – resulting in a patrol being sent to investigate the situation. The corrupted elves mistook the patrol for demons in disguise, and ambushed them. Only Elledariah and the disguised succubus survived the fight – at which point the succubus revealed her true nature to Elledariah before returning to Tanglebriar in triumph.
> Overcome by remorse and despair, Elledariah took her own life – only to rise as a [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Ships/Banshee|banshee]].
> Today, the elves have quarantined the region around Lichgate, but have not yet got around to trying to lay the banshee to rest.
