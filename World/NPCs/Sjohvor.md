> **Sjohvor** is a great wyrm [[White dragon|white dragon]] who claims the entirety of [[Iobaria|Iobarias]] [[Dvezda Marches]] as his personal territory. The eldest and strongest of the Iobarian [[Dragon|dragons]] to survive the [[Drakeplague]] of [[4519 AR]], Sjohvor is fickle, aggressive and dislikes others of his kind, as evidenced by the bones of dragons that lay outside the entrance to his cavern lair, [[Sjohvornor]]. While he slumbers much of the time, when he awakes, he surveys the Dvezda Marches for prey, and despite the lack of [[Humans|humans]] for him to dine on, he does hunt the [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] of the region, aside from those [[Tsolniva]] clans who have sworn allegiance to him.
> Sjohvor was formerly mated to another white dragon, who was killed nearly nine hundred years in the past when [[Frost giant|frost giants]] raided their lair. This has led Sjohvor to both nurse a vendetta against the frost giants and to have forged alliances with other creatures, namely a clan of Tsolniva centaurs, a pack of [[Adlet|adlets]], and a flock of [[Harpy|harpies]], to ensure his lair remains well-protected against intruders.
> A few centuries ago, Sjohvor killed a half-dozen elders of the [[Wyrmtooth Tribe]] of [[Taiga giant|taiga giants]], leading the tribe to settle down in the western Dvezda Marches and seek out his destruction.
