> **Ameiko Kaijitsu** is best known in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of [[Sandpoint]] as the proprietor of the [[Rusty Dragon]], the most popular tavern in town she is also a member of the town's small aristocracy.



## Relatives

> Ameiko is the only legitimate child of [[Lonjiku Kaijitsu]] and [[Atsuii Kaijitsu]], and half-sister of both [[Amaya Kaijitsu|Amaya]] (on her father's side) and [[Tsuto Kaijitsu]] (on her mother's side). For most of her life, she was unaware of her [[House Kaijitsu|familys]] real heritage as the only surviving royal family of [[Minkai]], or her status as the only legitimate heir to Minkai's throne.


## Personality

> Ameiko has artfully dodged several advances from potential suitors, which is the genesis of a rumor that she has a secret lover. She is unafraid to use what [[Magic|magic]] she has at her disposal around her establishment. She has been known to use [[Spell|spells]] like *unseen servant*, *charm person*, and *cure light wounds* to keep her place running in tip-top shape.


## Background

> Ameiko was born in [[4689 AR]]. Lonjiku closely supervised her, controlled whom he allowed to be her friends, and filled her days with lessons in [[Music|music]], diplomacy, magic, and academic subjects. Despite this, she still sneaked into town to play with friends and explore old buildings. Ameiko was the only person who visited Tsuto in the [[Turandarok Academy]], as Lonjiku ostracised him due to his status as a [[Half-elf|half-elf]] (and open proof of Atsuii's infidelity).
> Tsuto's influence on Ameiko was notable, despite his nearly total absence from her everyday life. In [[4701 AR]], when Ameiko tried to reconcile her father and brother, Tsuto struck her in a fit of rage, prompting her abandonment of Sandpoint for a year of adventuring.
> Ameiko returned to Sandpoint in [[4702 AR]] for her mother's funeral, and partook in another heated argument with her brother over his overstated opinion that Lonjiku had pushed Atsuii to her "accidental" death. After Tsuto left town, Ameiko decided to stay in Sandpoint to care for her father.
> At the age of 16, when life alone with her father and his servants grew unbearably depressing, Ameiko left home again and joined a group of [[Adventurer|adventurers]], and became particularly good friends with Alder Vhiski, the group's handsome young [[Varisian]] priest of [[Shelyn]]. In [[4706 AR]], they were captured by a degenerate [[Cannibalism|cannibal]] clan in the [[Fogscar Mountains]]. During their escape, nearly everyone was picked off by the cannibals until only Ameiko, Alder, and Alder's brother [[Sandru Vhiski|Sandru]] survived. As they tried to flee on a rowboat, Ameiko was bitten twice by the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake]] [[Animal companion|companion]] of the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] who led the cannibals. Alder pulled her to safety, but was himself bitten by the snake and eaten by the cannibals; Sandru eventually brought her back to Sandpoint.
> Some months later, Ameiko got a snake tattoo as a memorial to Alder, and spent her income from adventuring to buy the [[Rusty Dragon]]. She began to run the Rusty Dragon as a tavern for adventurers and moved away from [[Kaijitsu Manor]], leaving it to her father to live in with his servants.
> In [[4707 AR]], Ameiko lost both her father and half-brother during a series of [[Goblin|goblin]] raids on Sandpoint. She inherited the [[Sandpoint Glassworks]], but closed it down, as she prefered to focus on the Rusty Dragon and was frustrated by the rumours that the Glassworks were haunted by the [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] of the goblins' victims.


### Ascent to the Jade Throne

> In [[4711 AR]], Ameiko and a group of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] discovered a document that indicated a great Kaijitsu family legacy lay hidden in [[Brinewall]]. In Brinewall, they recovered the *Amatatsu Seal*, and learnt about the history of Ameiko's family: her real surname is Amatatsu, and she is the last surviving rightful heir to Minkai's throne after the usurper [[Soto Takahiro]] murdered Emperor [[Higashiyama Shigure]]. After recovering her family sword *[[Suishen]]* in [[Kalsgard]], they embarked on a journey from [[Avistan]] through the [[Crown of the World]] and the [[Forest of Spirits]] to Minkai to help Ameiko reclaim her birthright. After earning the support of Minkai's populace and the blessing of the previous emperors, Ameiko presented herself as the rightful ruler of Minkai, and was accepted by the Jade Throne after the defeat of the Jade Regent and his cronies.
> In [[4720 AR]], Ameiko visited [[Absalom]] to participate in the Radiant Festival, which she saw as an opportunity to bolster trade and establish connections with other nations.
