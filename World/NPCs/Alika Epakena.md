> **Alika Epakena**, also known as **Saint Alika** or **Saint Alika the Martyr**, was a famous resident of [[Korvosa]] in its earliest days, and due to her many reported oracular powers, was canonized after her death.



## History

> She was the first child born in [[4408 AR]] in [[Fort Korvosa]], as the settlement was then known. Gifted by [[Pharasma]] with potent seer abilities, she augmented this ability later in life by learning to read [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisian]] [[Harrow|Harrow cards]]. Her skill at prognostication helped protect the early settlers from otherwise unpredictable [[Shoanti]] raids.


### The Great Fire

> Alika foresaw the [[Great Fire]] that ravaged Korvosa in [[4429 AR]]. She also foresaw her own death during the fire, but despite this, heroically helped to put it out, even though she was killed in the process. She was luckily able to warn [[Waydon Endrin|Lord Magistrate Endrin]] (the city's ruler at the time) about the upcoming fire, who took the news to the [[Cheliax|Chelish crown]], who in turn sent a flotilla of ships. Although these additional troops arrived too late to save the city from the fire, their presence did deter the hostile Shoanti warriors, who would have otherwise taken advantage of Korvosa's weakened condition.


### Canonization

> She was posthumously sainted by the church of [[Aroden]]; supposedly the [[Herald|herald]] of Aroden at the time, [[Iomedae]], herself appeared to declare her canonization. She was buried in Korvosa, and her remains are now kept within a secure ossuary underneath the [[Grand Cathedral of Pharasma Korvosa|Grand Cathedral of Pharasma]] in the [[Gray district]].


## Naming

> Several places in Korvosa are named in her honour, most famously the [[Narrows of Saint Alika]], and her journals are still kept in the [[House Jeggare|Jeggare]] Library of the [[University of Korvosa]] in a secured vault. Her birthday on the 31st of [[Arodus]] is celebrated in Korvosa as a day of contemplative reflection.
