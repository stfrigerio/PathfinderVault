> **Kwislingyr** was a [[Gold dragon|gold dragon]] of the Aleirt bloodline and the only known specimen of his kind to fall into [[Evil|evil]].


## Background

> Some time before [[Cheliax]] split from [[Taldor]], Kwislingyr terrorized the imperial provinces that would one day become [[Andoran]] for nearly 150 years. Attempts by other gold dragons to redeem him, and by dragonslayers to fell him, all failed. Each time the tarnished gold dragon appeared, his scales grew duller and less lustrous.


### Death and burial

> Kwislingyr eventually died under unknown circumstances; his emaciated body was found by a company of [[Dwarf|dwarven]] miners who mistook him for a previously unknown [[Yellow dragon|yellow species]] of [[Chromatic dragon|chromatic dragon]]. The dwarves claimed the body and displayed it as a curiosity in several [[Sky Citadel|Sky Citadels]] until they buried him at the bequest of another gold dragon, Winsilax.
