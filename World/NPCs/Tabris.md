> **Tabris**, sometimes called the **Chronicler**, is an [[Angel|angel]] who was ordered to study the whole of the [[Multiverse|multiverse]]. His studies of the [[Plane|planes]] formed the basis of the *[[Chronicle of the Righteous]]*, *[[Concordance of Rivals]]*, and *[[Book of the Damned]]*, and for the *Book of the Damned* he was exiled from [[Heaven]].


## *Book of the Damned*

***Main article: [[Book of the Damned]]***
> Tabris infused part of his being with the *Book of the Damned*, creating a [[Demiplane|demiplane]] within the tome that collects and stores all [[Evil|evil]] thoughts into an infinite and ever-updating repository. This act resulted in Tabris's trial and exile from Heaven, and the *Book* vanished before it could be destroyed.


## Lost gospels

> The dessicated Tabris was allegedly encountered by [[Aldus Aldon Canter|Count Aldus Aldon Canter]] of [[Vieland]] in a lost sepulcher in the desert of [[Osirion]] with a sect of [[Immortal|immortal]] sages who venerated him. Aldus claimed to have studied the sect's secrets for three years before being sent back into the outside world as a messenger. Aldus founded the [[Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye]] and wrote the *[[Lost Gospels of Tabris]]* with the knowledge he had gained. Exiled members of the Order claim that Tabris charged Aldus with reuniting these lost truths with the *Book of the Damned*, but Aldus instead kept the gospels for his own use.
