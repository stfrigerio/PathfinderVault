> **Taggrick I**, also known as **Taggun I**, founded the [[Taggoret|Everlasting Kingdom of Taggoret]] in [[1562 AR]]. He was the last of the five [[Dwarf|dwarven]] brothers who established the five kingdoms in the region of the [[Five Kings Mountains]]. His face was immortalized in stone 800 years later after the end of the [[Five Kings Wars]]. It was carved into the side of Mount Langley to commemorate the signing of the [[Kerse Accord]], which ended the 700 year-old civil war between the dwarven kingdoms.
