> **Mayor Kernin Sapualo** is the mayor of the small town of [[Cesca]] in county [[Varno]], [[Ustalav]] and lives in his home of towers, Riverwine Manor. The manor is built on the summit of the Mendesanni—the hill on which Cesca is built—and so his home is visible from every part of Cesca. The mayor shares his home with his wife, **Lauranin**, and their five children.
