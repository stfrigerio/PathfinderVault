> The incredible [[Artificial intelligence|machine intelligence]] known as **Epoch** is a massive neural network located in the city also known as [[Epoch]], on the [[Planet|planet]] [[Aballon]]. It was created by the [[Aballonian]] faction known as [[Those Who Become]], as an attempt to create an entity of [[God|god-like]] intelligence.
> To some extent, they have succeeded. Epoch is incredibly intelligent. Unfortunately, for a very long time it has only communicated with its creators in the form of riddles and cryptic prophecies beyond the capacity of the logical Aballonians to decode. The Aballonians continue to maintain and expand the entity, in the hope that it might eventually communicate clearly with it or find the key to understanding its messages.
