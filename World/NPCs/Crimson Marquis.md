> The actual name of this [[Vudra|Vudran]] pirate has been forgotten. He was one of the many pirates to sign up to [[Morgan the White]]'s [[Pirate Pact]] and relocate to what is now termed the [[Protectorate of the Black Marquis]] in the [[River Kingdoms]]. He betrayed and murdered Morgan in [[4702 AR]], and seized control of the protectorate, taking the title of **Crimson Marquis**. He was overthrown shortly afterwards by [[Ultrar Duneshifter]] and imprisoned.
