> **Aneka Avertin** runs [[Sandpoint Savories]] along with her sister [[Arika Avertin|Arika]]. Their mother, [[Alma Avertin|Alma]], all but gave up running the store when their brother, sheriff [[Casp Avertin]], was murdered by the [[Chopper]] in [[4702 AR]]. Unlike Arika, Aneka is content with the store.
