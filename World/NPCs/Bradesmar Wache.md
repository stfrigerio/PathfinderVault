> **Free Captain Bradesmar Wache** of [[Mediogalti]] funded the rapid growth of [[Maidenspool]] in the [[Shackles]] before claiming that the settlement would surpass [[Drenchport]]. The town was subsequently destroyed by [[Locathah|locathahs]] and fires, with Bradesmar's wife Ella Wache among the dead.
> Bradesmar remains in his manor in Maidenspool, plotting vengeance and trying to recruit agents to carry it out in exchange for the supposed locations of buried treasure.
