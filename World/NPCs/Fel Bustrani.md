> **Fel Bustrani** was a [[Taldan]] [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Zyphus]], the [[Deity|god]] of accidental death, who learned of the location of a powerful [[Artifact|artifact]] known as the *[[Zyphus Stone]]*. He manipulated a young, ambitious [[Pathfinder]] named [[Bodriggan Wuthers]], to help him recover it from a chamber buried beneath the [[House of the Immortal Son]] in [[Oppara]]. Thanks to Wuthers, the two gained access to the opera house, and began an excavation lasting many months. When they finally breached the [[Chamber of the Stone]] where the artifact has been hidden by the [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] over 6,000 years ago, Bustrani betrayed the Pathfinder and killed him. Bustrani was killed soon thereafter by a group of Wuthers' fellow Pathfinders, who also prevented a major [[Zombie|zombie]] outbreak.
