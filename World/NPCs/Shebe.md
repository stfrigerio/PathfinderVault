> **Shebe** is one of the three Sky Masters who has been ruling [[Yjae]] since the fall of the [[Shory Empire]] alongside [[Musafti]] and [[Lokoa]], and is the strongest [[Aeromancer|aeromancer]] among them. She is a tall, dark-skinned woman clad in a skin-tight, shimmering [[Silver|silver]] scale suit and a cloak of white water flowing from [[Magic|magical]] epaulettes. She is a rival of Lokoa, whom she blames for having caused Yjae to crash by insisting on flying the city through the [[Wall of Heaven]]. Shebe has been refusing Musafti's romantic advances for millennia, causing Musafti to often support Lokoa over her out of spite.
