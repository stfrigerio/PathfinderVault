> **Ruxandra Katranjiev** is a young [[Human|human]] woman who leads a small band of disgruntled [[Werewolf|werewolves]] who live in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of [[Wolf's Ear|Wolfs Ear]]. Presumably a werewolf herself, she and her followers believe that the authority of the city of [[Magnimar]] should be more openly challenged by the inhabitants of her settlement. She even advocates that all [[Lycanthrope|non-lycanthropes]] be exiled, but so far her opinions have only been adopted by a small minority of the residents.
