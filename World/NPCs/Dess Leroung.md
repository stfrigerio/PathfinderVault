> **Dess Leroung** was a [[KorvosaMagistrates|magistrate]] in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]] who first had the idea of importing [[Otyugh|otyughs]] from [[Cheliax]] to solve the city's growing waste-disposal crisis. Although this occurred approximately 200 years ago, his system is still in place, and the otyughs still inhabit the sewers beneath [[Old Korvosa]] on [[Endrin Isle]].
