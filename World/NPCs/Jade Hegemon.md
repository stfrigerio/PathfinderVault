> The **Jade Hegemon** was the mythical ruler of an unnamed empire of [[Elemental|elementals]] living in the [[Valashmai Jungle]] of southern [[Tian Xia]] during the [[Age of Serpents]]. Said to have been an immortal [[Azer|azer]] who was wreathed in green flame, his ultimate fate, along with the fate of his empire, is unknown. The descendants of that kingdom are said to have migrated to the [[Chenlun Mountains]] after its fall, and are still blamed for that region's heavy volcanic activity.
