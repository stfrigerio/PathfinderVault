> **Oltar Vinmark** embarked upon his duty supporting the empire of [[Taldor]] as a member of the [[Ulfen Guard]] in service to [[Stavian III|Grand Prince Stavian III]], and he watched over the monarch during the burial of Stavian's only son, [[Carrius II]]. Stavian repaid Oltar's kindness by granting him the title of Baron of [[Oppara]] in [[4699 AR]], a position traditionally held by the grand prince himself but, on occasion, given to another person of the monarch's choice. Oltar's nomination has proved unpopular with Oppara's nobility, due to his perceived status as an uncultured foreigner, but his popularity with the grand prince has, for the most part, superseded the nobles' distaste.
