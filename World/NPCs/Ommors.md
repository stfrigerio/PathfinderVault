> The female [[Sangudaemon|sangudaemon]] **Ommors** had been living as a prisoner below the settlement of [[Valahuv]] in the Thunderstair for hundreds of years when the [[Worldwound]] opened nearby in [[4606 AR]]. When the town was nearly overrun by the first [[Demon|demonic]] attack, its inhabitants begged Ommors for her protection, which she granted in exchange for being worshipped as a [[Deity|goddess]]; today, no demons attack the village, but Ommors feeds off the hurt and the sacrifice of the villagers. At the Delvegate, priests used to bring sacrifice for Ommors.
