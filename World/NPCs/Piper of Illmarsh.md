> A notorious prisoner of [[Harrowstone]] near [[Ravengro]], the **Piper of Illmarsh'**s real name was, and is, unknown. The Piper was a murderer whose signature style of killing involved his masterwork [[Silver|silver]] flute, [[Poison|poison]], and [[Stirge|stirges]]. His victims would hear a sorrowful tune played on the flute before they were killed by the Piper, who would poison their food with lich dust in order to paralyse them, and then let his pet stirges drink his victim's blood.
> The Piper of Illmarsh was removed to Harrowstone in [[4661 AR]], along with four other notorious criminals, and died that same year in the great fire that destroyed the prison: his body was burnt to ashes in the part of the dungeon known as 'Reaper's Hold'. Shortly before his death, the Piper had taken part with others in the torture and murder of the prison warden, [[Lyvar Hawkran]].
