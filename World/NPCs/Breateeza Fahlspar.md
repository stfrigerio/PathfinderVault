**Grand Duchess Breateeza Fahlspar** is ruler of the prefecture and adores hunting, animal husbandry, and exploring her family’s vast landholdings.
> Duchess Fahlspar finds politicking and social interaction tiring and sometimes disappears on lengthy hunting expeditions to regain her composure. Partially due to her disdain for Taldan politics, she finds Andoren ideals of democracy and freedom appealing and corresponds with several prominent politicians from [[Andoran]].
> Her apparent rejection of Taldan identity is troubling to her family members and tensions have begun to grow with her growing interest in radical ideologies.
