> **Basaalee Minvandu** is a cruel man, owner of [[Magnimar]]'s [[Matador's Lodge|Matadors Lodge]], known for using brutal handling of [[Animal|animals]] for entertainment. He also produces the annual rodeo at [[Serpent's Run|Serpents Run]]. Despite calls from the church of [[Desna]] and [[House Deverin]] for investigations into his activities, he uses logic and a charismatic personality to avoid problems, often by manipulating the [[Order of the Nail]] to provide him support.
