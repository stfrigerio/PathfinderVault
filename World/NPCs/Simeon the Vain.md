> **[[Free Captains|Free Captain]] Simeon the Vain** built the small port town of [[Blackblood Cay]] on the [[Shark Island]] in the [[Shackles]] in [[4703 AR]]. Blackblood Cay now hosts ten more [[Pirate|pirate]] captains, while Simeon remains its lord. Simeon's [[Ship|sloop]] *[[Blushing Bride]]* is known for its extraordinary speed. Rumor has it that Simeon intends to contest [[Avimar Sorrinash|Avimar Sorrinashs]] dominance of the Shark Island. Many joke about Simeon's flamboyant dress and his expensive fragrances, but none would dare to do that to his face.
