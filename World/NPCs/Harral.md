> **King Harral** was the last king of [[Saggorak|Pious Kingdom of Saggorak]], one of the five [[Dwarf|dwarven]] kingdoms of the [[Five Kings Mountains]] region. He was one of the five kings who signed the [[Kerse Accord]] peace treaty. His image is depicted on a huge monument carved onto the storm-crowned heights of the Lighting Top mountain. In [[2519 AR]], when Saggorak was besieged by [[Orc|orcs]], King Harral perished alongside his people, but has continued to exist as a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]]-like [[Undead|undead]] creature, compelled to protect Saggorak until the city is gone.
