> **Xol-Nomag** leads the [[Ghost Wolves]] of [[Numeria|Numerias]] [[Sellen Hills]] into battle against [[Technology|technology]] and those who use it. Her [[Kellid]] tribe uses [[Magic|magical]] tactics and [[Skymetal|skymetal]] [[Weapon|weapons]] to destroy everything from [[Robot|robots]] to [[Technic League]] agents, and her fury inspires fear, awe, and loyalty. She has recently begun to oppose the [[Black Sovereign]] [[Kevoth-Kul]] for his embrace of forbidden technologies and cozying up to settled Kellids and [[Android|androids]], and while Kevoth-Kul has mostly ignored Xol-Nomag, if tensions persist, they can escalate to outright war.
