> **Jasper Korvaski** is the manager of the [[Sandpoint Mercantile League]]. A retired [[Paladin|paladin]] of [[Abadar]], Jasper remains a loyal and devout follower of his [[Deity|god]]. His nigh-incorruptible character makes him a valuable asset to the four families who own the Mercantile League—enough so that most of them are willing to overlook the potential scandal of his romantic relationship with [[Cyrdak Drokkus]], a liaison that, despite the best efforts of both men, has become one of Sandpoint's worst-kept secrets. The ultra-conservative [[House Scarnetti|Scarnettis]] strongly disapprove of both the relationship and the town's general tolerance of the gay couple, and would very much like Jasper to pack up and move back to his former home in [[Magnimar]], but the support of the other three families largely shields him from the impact of their disapproval.
