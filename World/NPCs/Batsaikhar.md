> **Prince Batsaikhar** is the ruler of [[Ordu-Aganhei]] and brother of [[Kiriltai Khan]], khan of [[Hongal]]. An enormous man, he is renowned for his etiquette, delicate words, insatiable lust (particularly toward foreign women), and perpetual smile. Although he views himself as a firm but fair ruler, citizens of Ordu-Aganhei live in fear of Batsaikhar, as he is willing to behead a hundred followers if angered, smiling as he does so. He is notorious in Hongal for being an enemy of dirt and preferring the comforts of civilisation over his people's nomadic life.
