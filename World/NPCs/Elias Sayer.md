> **Elias Sayer** is the owner of the Strapping Lad, a bondage-themed bordello in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]].  Located in the service industry-centered neighborhood of [[Hospice]], the Strapping Lad is the preeminent all-male bordello in the city, some say in all of Varisia.  What is unknown to most, is that Sayer is secretly the leader of the [[Tallow Boys]], a gang of male prostitutes who are some of the most influential power brokers in Kaer Maga.
