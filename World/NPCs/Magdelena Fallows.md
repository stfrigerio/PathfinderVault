> **Magdelena Fallows** currently jointly leads the [[Bellflower Network]] alongside her twin brother [[Martum Fallows|Martum]], alternating their appearances as the [[World/NPCs/Farmer]] and hiring actors to enhance the mystique of the Farmer personage. Born to a fugitive [[Slavery|slave]] who died giving birth to them, Magdelena and Martum were adopted into the Bellflower Network and grew up inside it. Their influence and popularity attracted the attention of the previous Farmer, before they recently took over the leadership of the Bellflower Network. Magdelena is craftier and more tactically minded than her brother, and often pursues secret important tasks while Martum serves as the public face of the Farmer.
