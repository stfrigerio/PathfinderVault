> **Toishihebi** is a [[Forest dragon|forest dragon]] dwelling in the ruins of Uddo, former capital of [[Minkai]], who seeks dominance over lesser beings like [[Humanoid|humanoids]] by looting the graves of [[Teikoku]] shoguns and accumulating a hoard large enough to become a bandit king. Locals falsely believe him to be the vengeful [[Dragon|draconic]] incarnation of Shogun Teikoku Takeru.



## Appearance

> Toishihebi usually takes the form of **Hiyuke**, a [[Human|human]] bandit infamous for stealing from the poor and the rich alike and selling antiques (usually pottery stolen from Teikoku graves) to smugglers along the Kamiteki River.


## Relatives

> Toishihebi hatched more than 300 years ago in the woods northwest of Shogokabe, and led his siblings in a revolt against their abusive parents. He was the only survivor of that fight, and was forced to hide in the ruins of Uddo when badly wounded and hunted by other predators, leaving his family's hoard behind.
> During his quest to gather allies, Toishihebi travelled to the [[Higashita Coast]] in [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] form and persuaded a queen to bear him three [[Half-dragon|half-dragon]] sons. They became [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]], and joined their father under the ruins of [[Matsukanmuri]], one of the castles in Uddo, when they came of age.


## Associates

> Toishihebi has press-ganged the local [[Ratfolk|ratfolk]] population into his service, harassing them and forcing them to serve as scouts and cannon fodder. The terrified ratfolk have been fomenting legends about the cruel habits of their master.
> Toishihebi spends most of his time fighting the Ashen Watch, a secret society of [[Monk|monks]] who have guarded the graves of Teikoku shoguns since that empire still existed, employing [[Teleportation|teleportation]] devices to patrol the necropolis. He has also been impeded by a band of [[Earth yai|earth yai]], who came from the [[Forest of Spirits]] and have begun to prowl around Uddo.
