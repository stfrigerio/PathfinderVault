> **Tyari Varvatos** is the current matron of the [[Sanctuary Trunau|sanctuary]] in the small town of [[Trunau]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. The young [[Cleric|cleric]] is the younger sister of the Second Sword Knight of the [[Sancta Iomedaea]] in [[Vigil]], [[Aylunna Varvatos]]. A number of citizens speculate why the young cleric toils in Trunau instead of alongside her prominent sister, with most presuming she is here to create her own name rather than live in her sister's shadow. Her close ally is an errant [[Paladin|paladin]] named [[Brantos Calderon]], formerly stationed at [[Castle Firrine]] who forsook his post to pledge his blade (and some say his heart) to the resolute young cleric who fights on this harsh frontier.
