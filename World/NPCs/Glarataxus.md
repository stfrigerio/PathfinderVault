> **Glarataxus** is a [[Red dragon|red dragon]] who has periodically plagued the towns and settlements near the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of  [[Korvosa]] since [[4569 AR]]. Absent for years, he will suddenly lay waste to a community with no perceivable reason and disappear just as quickly.  His most recent attacks were on the communities of [[Veldraine]], [[Korvosa]], and [[Palin's Cove|Palins Cove]] in [[4674 AR]].  Attempts to negotiate with and appease the [[Dragon|dragon]] have always failed, but this may be explained by a recent revelation: Glarataxus is deaf.
