> **Rezlarabren** is a [[Brine dragon|brine dragon]] who makes her home in a series of underwater caverns on [[Thoska Isle]], near the end of the [[Ironbound Archipelago]]. She has allied with a tribe of [[Skum|skum]] after destroying the [[Merrow|merrows]] that ruled them and lived in the caverns she now lairs in, and employs the tribe as miners to extract the [[Salt|salt]] that she trades to the [[Elves|elves]] of the [[Mordant Spire]]. The elves have been trying to convince Rezlarabren to ally with them against their [[Alghollthu|alghollthu]] enemies, but the brine dragon has so far declined on the basis that she does not stand to gain anything from entering the conflict.
> Rezlarabren maintains an enmity with the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kings]], stemming from when Ulfen warriors attempted to hunt her down in her youth as a possible future threat to themselves, and considers both them and their allies to be her enemies.
