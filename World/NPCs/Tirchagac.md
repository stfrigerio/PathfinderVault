> **Tirchagac** was the warlord of the [[Scrag|aquatic trolls]] in the [[Glacier Lake]] during the [[Winter War]] in [[3313 AR]]. The aquatic trolls of what is today called the [[Scrag Deep tribe]] played an important role in the victory of the army of [[Baba Yaga]] and as a reward, she gave the scrags dominion over the extensive underwater caverns at the deepest point of the Glacier Lake, now known as [[Scrag Deep]]. The tribe is still led by [[Tirchagac current|descendants of their ancient warlord Tirchagac]]. Each of the tribe's warlords takes on the "war-name" of its ancestor.
