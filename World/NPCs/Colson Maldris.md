> **Colson Maldris** is the former head of the [[Liberty's Edge faction|Libertys Edge]] and [[Andoran faction|Andoren]] factions in the [[Pathfinder Society]]; his successor is [[Tamrin Credence]]. He was retired in [[4718 AR]] after attempting a daring abduction plot to force members of the [[Seven Houses]] and their allies to face justice for corruption in his native [[Andoran]]. He is currently a fugitive suspected to be headed toward the [[Galt|Galtan]] capital of [[Isarn]].


## Background

> Colson was the most senior member of the [[Andoran|Andoren]] [[Eagle Knights]] permanently stationed in [[Absalom]]. His position near the [[Grand Lodge]] allowed Colson an inordinate amount of influence over the [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] within the organization, and he uses this to operate a number of clandestine missions as part of larger [[Pathfinder Society]] operations.
> In [[4712 AR]], [[Michellia Blakros]] asked Colson to marry her, but he rejected her offer as it would require him to change his name and forfeit his rank. Due to his involvement with the Society, the [[Decemvirate]] was forced to invite [[Blakros family|the Blakros family]] to that year's [[Grand Convocation]], taking place at the Grand Lodge, as a way to smooth over the frayed relations between the two organizations.
> In [[4714 AR]], Colson—disillusioned by deepening corruption within the Andoren government—left his homeland for a more permanent residence in Absalom in order to form [[Liberty's Edge faction|Libertys Edge]], a watchdog organization dedicated to rooting out corruption across the [[Inner Sea region]].
