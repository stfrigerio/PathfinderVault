> **Aeteperax** was a great wyrm [[Black dragon|black dragon]] who plagued [[Taldor]] during the [[Dragon Plague]] from [[3660 AR|3660]] to [[3672 AR]]. It was killed by Lady Tula Belhaim in the [[Dragonfen]] in central Taldor. Lady Tula had previously lost her home town, [[Nazilli]], to Aeteperax's depredations.


## Later sightings

> Many centuries later, a young [[Dragon|dragon]] came to [[Belhaim]], a town founded near Aeteperax's bones, and took the name Aeteperax for himself, pretending to be the black dragon risen from the dead.
