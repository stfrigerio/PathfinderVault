> The [[Wizard|wizard]] **Sheel Leroung** was an political ally of the founder of the [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]], [[Daidian Ruel]], and beginning in [[4581 AR]] aided in his research into the afterlife and the organization of [[Hell|Hells]] legions. In [[4599 AR]], he was given permission by [[Aligois Thels|Lictor Aligois Thels]] to take 20 [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]] into the western edge of the [[Menador Mountains]] on a private venture. In return for this, Leroung provided funds to create a new Hellknight fortress there: [[Citadel Enferac]].
> In [[4621 AR]], on the day of his 89th birthday, Leroung died only to rise as a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]]. He used the *Vicious Link*, an [[Artifact|artifact]] said to have been a gift from [[Dispater]], to travel to the Island of Seven Chains, where he built the Ashstaves as his new home. He continues to advise his successors, while spending time conducting personal research. Sometimes, he comes to the Palace Locclairo in [[Dis]] to assist Daidian Ruel's search for the [[Soul|soul]] of his [[Eris Ruel|son]].
