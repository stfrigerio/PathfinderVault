> **Ainamuuren** is one of the last surviving [[Saumen kar|saumen kar]] on [[Golarion]].



## Appearance

> Ainamuuren is a large, muscular, horned [[Humanoid|humanoid]] covered in thick white furs. Unlike others of his kind, Ainamuuren has four, instead of two horns. His dark skin and [[Magic item|magical]] [[Greataxe|greataxe]] are both inscribed with intricate markings, focusing on angular lines and triangles. While they have no obvious gaps, it is unknown if his markings are complete or not.


## Relatives

> According to Ainamuuren, he is the great-great-great-grandson of Aktamuuren, who was responsible for striking a pact with the saumen kar's [[Deity|deity]] to contain an ancient [[Evil|evil]] sleeping under the ice sheets of the [[Crown of the World]].


## Associates

> Since first meeting the [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] elder Seshu in [[4718 AR]], when aiding the [[Pathfinder Society]] seal away an ancient evil that the society inadvertently released, Ainamuuren has met Seshu once a month to pass on his secrets to her. He has not seen another saumen kar for a century, and does not how how many are still alive. While the saumen kar have long refused to share the responsibilities of their pact with others, Ainamuuren believes that this must be done: if his people were to die out, the Erutaki must take up their mantle to keep the ancient evil in its prison.
