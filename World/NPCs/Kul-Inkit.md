> **Kul-Inkit** is the consort of the [[Black Sovereign]] [[Kevoth-Kul]], and the second-in-command of [[Numeria]].


## Appearance

> Kul-Inkit is a slender but muscular [[Kellid]] woman with short black hair. She wears spiked hide armor and wields a [[Battleaxe|battleaxe]] and heavy steel [[Shield|shield]].


## Background

> For many years, Kul-Inkit had little or no interest in spending personal time with Kevoth-Kul, due to his hedonism. After he managed to recover from his addiction to Numerian fluids, she rekindled her interest and now seems to support his goals. She is one of the few people who knows that Kevoth-Kul no longer ages, and seeks to join him as Numeria's eternal ruler, either through the *[[Sun orchid elixir|sun orchid elixir]]*, [[Genie|genie]] wishcraft, or uploading her [[Soul|soul]] into a [[Construct|construct]]. Kul-Inkit has also become one of the most devoted followers of [[Casandalee]], believing that [[Technology|technology]] is the key to Numeria's future.
