## Background

> Raised by a wealthy family of [[Nhimbaloth]] worshipping cultists, she (and her family) were ejected from [[Absalom]] when she was only six years old after the city learned of their [[Evil|evil]] ritualistic sacrifices. This instilled a deep hatred of Absalom in her heart.
> By [[4230 AR]], she had become a powerful [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]] and secretly relocated to the [[Isle of Kortos]] to build a *Gauntlight*, a [[Magic|magical]] lighthouse, situated above a subterranean shrine to Nhimbaloth called the Empty Vault. In 4234 AR, *Gauntlight* was completed, and she began to work on the dungeons underneath, which she named the Abomination Vaults. Her plan was to to recruit and house subterranean monsters, beasts, and other allies in the dungeons to unleash on Absalom.
> In 4244 AR, a group of [[Adventurer|adventurers]], called the Roseguard, investigated the lighthouse and killed Belcorra, but not before she could slay their rogue Otari Ilvashti. By [[4719 AR]], she re-awakened as a ghost and began to to reactivate *Gauntlight*, a task she completed two years later in [[4721 AR]].
