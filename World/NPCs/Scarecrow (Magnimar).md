> The **Scarecrow** is a [[Flesh golem|flesh golem]] that was created by [[Vorel Foxglove]] at the behest of the [[Brothers of the Seven]] over 100 years ago. At some point in the intervening decades, the [[Golem|golem]]'s elemental spirit went crazy, which resulted in the Scarecrow gaining sentience. Parts of men, [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horses]], and [[Cattle|cows]] were used in building this golem. It is stitched very crudely and wears straw- and dung-covered rags.
