> **Commandant Marcus Thalassinus Endrin** was the leader of the [[Sable Company]] in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]]. He was known as a dedicated man whose strict adherence of honor and tradition sometimes blinded him to what was best politically. After a failed attempt to assassinate [[Ileosa Arabasti|Queen Ileosa Arabasti]] in public, he was stabbed by her. Although presumed dead, he was in truth only beaten to near death then imprisoned within [[Deathhead Vault]], kept alive by [[Kordaitra Destaid]] under Ileosa's orders.
