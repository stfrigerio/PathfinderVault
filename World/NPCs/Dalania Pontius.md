> The [[Pathfinder]] **Dalania Pontius** is best known for being the author of an inaccurate account on [[Dragon|dragons]] published in the infamous *Volume 11* of the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]*.  She wrote the story based on information given to her by the chatty [[Brass dragon|brass dragon]] [[Helexa]] as her primary source.  Unfortunately, Helexa was more interested in telling a good story rather than in accurately telling the truth, and the account ended up being published with many misleading statements and outright lies.  As a direct result of this information, many Pathfinders lost their lives, and countless more were injured.
