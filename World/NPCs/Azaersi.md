> **General Azaersi** is the leader of the [[Ironfang Legion]], and a visionary who has carved out a new nation for her people that she now rules: [[Oprak]]. In the [[Goblin language|Goblin]] [[Language|language]], "Azaersi" literally means "**Aza the Immortal**".



## Associates

> Azaersi views the [[Dark naga|dark naga]] Zanathura as a kindred spirit, and has begun to trust her even more than fellow [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]], but is unaware of the subtle [[Magic|magic]] that Zanathura uses to influence her. Her spymaster is Taurgreth, whom she sent to forge an alliance with [[Arlantia]], but who only ended up being imprisoned by the [[Blighted fey|blighted fey]]. Henra, Azaersi's personal trainer and a member of the Ironfang Legion's command staff, has known her since she was a child.


## Background

> Azaersi was born in [[Isger]] and came of age during the [[Goblinblood Wars]]. When she was still a child, her outpost was overrun by [[Eagle Knights]], and her gut pierced by a [[Human|human]] [[Spear|spear]]. She was thrown into a mass grave and awakened several hours later, too stubborn to die. While the humans were celebrating, Azaersi fled under the cover of the night to [[Molthune]], carrying a fervent hatred of humans with her. She met others hobgoblins in the [[Menador Mountains]] who saw her as a promising leader.
> In Molthune, Azaersi became a bandit lord operating in the [[Shrikewood]], attracting numerous followers due to her charisma despite never fully recovering from her injury. When Molthune sent a regiment of soldiers to put an end to Azaersi's banditry, her outnumbered, ill-equipped band nonetheless prevailed. The Molthuni commander, Vetrigan Sebine, gave her an offer: Molthune needed soldiers whose actions could be denied by the state but, nevertheless, Molthune would be willing to arm, equip, and unleash such bandits on [[Nirmathas]]. This was the beginning of the Ironfang Legion.
> With new contacts and information, Azaersi then began to plan a scheme of domination and a homeland for the hobgoblins denied by the Goblinblood Wars. When she discovered the *[[Onyx Key]]* and Zanathura, Azaersi led the Ironfang Legion into the [[Vault of the Onyx Citadel]], recruited many of its [[Elemental|elemental]] denizens, and conquered the vault from the [[Xiomorn|xiomorn]] Ziguch the Seventh Facet. With the Onyx Citadel and its [[Plane|extraplanar]] Stone Roads under her control, Azaersi could launch attacks without warning and disengage without obstacle. The latter, however, was possible only with the *sardonyx shard*, a removable piece of the *Onyx Key*.
> Azaersi later sent Taurgreth to the [[Fangwood 1]] in search of an alliance with the forest's blighted fey. Distrustful of the [[Fey|fey]], Taurgreth borrowed Azaersi's *sardonyx shard* as an emergency escape mechanism, without realising that the fey's magic prevented [[Planar travel|planar travel]]. With the *sardonyx shard* in Arlantia's hands, the Ironfang Legion lost the ability to return to the Vault of the Onyx Citadel unaided.


## Possessions

> Azaersi wields a [[Magic item|magical]] [[Falcata|falcata]] known as *Truth*, and a [[Dagger|dagger]] enchanted with the ability to return to her when thrown.
