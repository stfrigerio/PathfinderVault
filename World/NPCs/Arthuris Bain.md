> **Arthuris Bain** was the head priest in a small church of [[Iomedae]] just south of the small town of [[Trunau]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. The church was serving the local communities. When [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]]'s army retreated and Trunau made the decision to stand and fight, the priests of Iomedae refused to abandon the church, believing the goddess would protect them. Though they fought bravely the church was burned to the ground by the rampaging [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Orc|orcs]] and the priests were slain. Today the site is known as the [[Burned Church Trunau|Burned Church]].
