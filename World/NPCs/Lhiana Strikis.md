> **Lhiana Strikis** is a [[Durotas]] (city guard captain) of the [[Westcrown Dottari|regidottari]] or 'palace wardens'. She is a cruel slave-driver of a commander, who retains control only through the threat of retracting the higher pay and prestige that the regidottari enjoy over their common dottari colleagues. Rumors says that she has had many affairs with ranking nobles in the city.
