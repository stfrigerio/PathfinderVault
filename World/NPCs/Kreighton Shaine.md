> [[Venture-Captain]] **Kreighton Shaine** holds the title of [[Master of Scrolls]] within [[Absalom|Absaloms]] [[Pathfinder Society]].
> Kreighton Shaine is considered strange and absent-minded to his [[Pathfinder]] peers, but his abilities in solving puzzles and codes more than make up for his eccentricities. His teaching style is heavy with tangential discussions and eccentric presentation, such as rhyming lectures and unexpected midnight trivial competitions.
