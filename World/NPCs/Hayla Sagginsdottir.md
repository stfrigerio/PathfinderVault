> **General Hayla Sagginsdottir** leads the dwarven city of [[Rolgrimmdur]] in the [[Five Kings Mountains]]. She is a veteran who has involved in countless [[Darklands]] and surface campaigns. She is an elected official rather than a monarch. Her main rivals come from the Grakodor family, descendants of [[Grak the Younger]] who founded [[Grakodan]] centuries ago.
