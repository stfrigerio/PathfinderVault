> **Avsheros the Delightful**, later to be called 'the Betrayer', was a [[Celestial|celestial]] [[Planetar|planetar]] who served the Goddess [[Calistria]].
> He fell from her favour for numerous missteps including the fathering of [[Kharnas]], the unwanted result of his dalliance with a mortal woman. Blaming his fall on his lover and son, he gifted the pair to a noble [[Efreeti|efreeti]] wizard Hamza bin Gamal of the [[City of Brass]], abandoning them to their fate. Years later, a venegeful Kharnas eventually tracked down his angelic father and imprisoned him within an artefact known as the Radiant Spark, imprisoning Asheros and utilising him as a living weapon in the [[Radiant Siege]] in [[1619 AR]].
> Although the assault on [[Absalom]] ultimately failed, Avsheros himself remained trapped in the lowest levels of the siege tower for centuries. He was eventually discovered and slain by agents from the city in [[4720 AR]].
