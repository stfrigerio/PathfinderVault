> The military oligarchy of the war-torn nation of [[Molthune]] is governed by the nine [[General Lords]] who are led by **Imperial Governor Markwin Teldas**, who also holds the title and role of High Commander of the Molthuni [[Imperial Army]]. Teldas is intelligent and aggressive, and while few like him, most Molthuni acknowledge his skill in governing. Teldas has developed a long-term plan to improve Molthune's military and work force by offering government subsidies to families with many children while simultaneously granting full citizenship to [[Slavery|serfs]] who serve five years in the military. This has made him popular with the lower classes but made him some enemies among the ruling elite.
> In [[4706 AR]], Governor Teldas declared the [[Pathfinder Society]] an enemy of the state after the Society established a [[Pathfinder lodge]] in the [[Nirmathas|Nirmathi]] capital: Nirmathas and Molthune have been at war for years.
