> **Abtaroh Vorenic** is a cultist of the [[Dominion of the Black]] and descendant of a family with a history of exposure to Dominion agents. She employs other cultists as her family manor's staff in [[Macridi]], [[Druma]].
> She received visions from the [[Emissary from Beyond]] that led to her to leave Druma for the town of [[Dustpawn]], where the Emissary expected to arrive on [[Golarion]] via the *[[Lirgen's Glory|Lirgens Glory]]*. Several of her agents stayed at the [[Mineshaft]] inn, refusing its food and drink in favor of a *sustaining spoon*.
> They captured the [[Nesher Mines]] and began collecting [[Dream crystal|dream crystals]] from the southern Dustpawn hinterlands, which Abtaroh used to synthesize [[Dream crystal toxin|dream crystal toxin]] based on instructions she received from the Emissary's visions. Her cultists used the toxin on their [[Weapon|weapons]] and to pollute Dustpawn's water supply, causing its residents to experience bestial dreams and resulting in some of them transforming into [[Id mutant|id mutants]]. She also sought the *[[Orrery of distant worlds|orrery of distant worlds]]* and dispatched her followers to retrieve it, often leading to their deaths, although Abtaroh was able to deceive [[Sonarisa]] and recover the sphere she took from the wreckage of the *Lirgen's Glory*.
> Abtaroh keeps a journal of her visions and actions, written in [[Aklo]].
