> **Prelate Hulrun Shappok** was the leader of all [[Inquisitor|inquisitors]] in [[Mendev]], and the ruler of the northern city of [[Kenabres]] prior to his death. He was second in power in Mendev only to [[Galfrey|Queen Galfrey]].


## Background

> In his youth, Hulrun was violently zealous in his quest to eradicate [[Demon|demonic]] taint from Mendev. Indeed, it is believed that his ruthless execution of several dozen 'witches' sparked the [[Third Mendevian Crusade]] in [[4665 AR]]. Certainly, these [[Witch|witch]] burnings encouraged others to join the inquisitions.
> When he was granted the title of Prelate in [[4682 AR]], Hulrun was forced to temper his obsession, although it has only been in the last few years that he has truly begun to understand the shame his inquisitions have brought to the faith of [[Iomedae]]. Despite this, Hulrun has repeatedly proven himself a fine commander and strategically brilliant.
> In [[4713 AR]], Hulrun was one of the first people killed when the demons launched their largest invasion of Kenabres yet.
