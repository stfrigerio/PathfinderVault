> **Tashanna** is a daughter of [[Baba Yaga]]. She was the ninth Queen of [[Irrisen]], reigning from [[4113 AR]] until [[4213 AR]].


## Background

> In 4113 AR, Tashanna was placed on Irrisen's throne, succeeding her sister [[Karina]]. In [[4155 AR]], she invaded the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], conquering all land from the [[Frozen Road]] and the [[Gullik River]] to the base of the [[Tusk Mountains]], and built the city of [[Tashagrot]] to serve as the new provincial capital. However, this conquest only lasted for four years before the land was reclaimed by the [[Mammoth Lords]].
> Near the end of her reign, Tashanna became suspicious of Baba Yaga's purpose in installing her daughters as Irriseni monarchs. When the time came for Baba Yaga to return to [[Golarion]] and replace Tashanna with her next daughter, she used the *[[Torc of Kostchtchie]]* to force [[Kostchtchie]] to participate in a rebellion against her mother. However, Tashanna underestimated Baba Yaga's power: after defeating Kostchtchie, Baba Yaga put down Tashanna's rebellion, captured her, paraded her before her defeated troops, then executed all of them, and interred them in the [[Veil of Frozen Tears]], a hidden necropolis in northern Irrisen.
> Baba Yaga then installed [[Velikas]] to replace Tashanna as queen of Irrisen. Nevertheless, she was impressed by the rebellion such that she did not turn Tashanna into a [[Crone queen|crone queen]] like her predecessors. Instead, Tashanna was forever banished from Golarion and the surrounding [[Plane|planes]], so she could no longer interfere in her mother's plots. However, Tashanna was still able to rule elsewhere as a tyrant and [[Demon|demon]] [[Binding outsiders|binder]].


## Legacy

> Tashanna commissioned the Ice Gardens of Neverith to be featured at the Radiant Festival in 4120 AR. This maze of sparkling sculptures still entrances visitors 
to [[Whitethrone]] to this day.
> In [[4713 AR]], [[Elvanna]], incumbent and soon-to-be-removed queen of Irrisen, discovered Tashanna's journal, and from it, discovered Baba Yaga's plans for her daughters.
