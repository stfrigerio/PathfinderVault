> **Perishial Kalissreavil** serves as an ambassador of the [[Mierani Forest|Mierani]] [[Elf|elves]] in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]]. The Mierani Forest lies some distance from the ambitions of Korvosa and the two powers have been at peace for nearly a century. The ambassador, a handful of his aides, and family members have lived peacefully within the [[South Shore|South Shore district]] through most of this period.
> Claiming they serve to increase the ties between Korvosa and the Mierani elves, Perishial welcomes trysts with the more wayward and adventurous of the young daughters of the local noble houses. Rather lustful by nature, Perishial has fathered countless [[Half-elf|half-elf]] offspring and the male members of his entourage have collectively contributed to dozens more.
