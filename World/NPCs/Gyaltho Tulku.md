> **Gyaltho Tulku** is the appointed ruler of the capital city of [[Sangpo-Jong]], and therefore the acting ruler of the entire [[Samsaran|samsaran]] nation of [[Zi Ha]]. Gyaltho is a devout [[Cleric|priest]] of the god [[Tsukiyo]] and he lives within the Temple of Tsukiyo that sits in the heart of Sangpo-Jong. Gyaltho has been a priest at this temple for his past three lifetimes and wonders if this will be his final reincarnation before moving on from the [[Material Plane]]. Gyaltho is concerned, however, as he has come to feel spiritually distant from his god Tsukiyo and no amount of contemplation or meditation has been able to resolve this feeling.
