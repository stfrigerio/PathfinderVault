> **Ollix Thareus Lucitrex Kaddar** is the only living son of Lord Kaddar of Kadria, though he was exiled from the kingdom in [[4710 AR]]. He travels primarily with his "cleric" companion [[Phargas]] as he struggles to survive in the [[River Kingdoms]]. Shortly after his exile began, Ollix discovered the body of a dead [[Pathfinder]] and has since taken on the guise of a member of the [[Pathfinder Society]] himself, hoping that earning fame and fortune through his new affiliation will get him back in his father's good graces.
