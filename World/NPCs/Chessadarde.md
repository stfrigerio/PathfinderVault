> **Father Chessadarde** is the mysterious high priest of the [[Cult of the Eye]], a dark and weird religion of the [[Shackles]] which centers its worship on the [[Eye of Abendego]], the permanent hurricane that appeared following the death of [[Aroden]]. He claims to have received his divine visions from the [[Deluged God]] after sailing into the heart of [[Azlant|Ancient Azlant]] to the west.
