> **Malduoni** has been serving an unprecedented four terms as [[Keeper of the First Law]] overseeing [[Rahadoum|Rahadoums]] [[Council of Elders]]. A well-liked man, Malduoni has proved himself to be an adept leader and keen politician—few Keepers are re-elected even once. His success has increased his power on the international stage as well, since the continuity in rule means other nations can no longer rely on waiting out the term of a Keeper who disagrees with them.
