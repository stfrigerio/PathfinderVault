> **Zethivaxus Djeed** was a [[Nagaji|nagaji]] hero who led an expedition into the [[Darklands]] region known as the [[Clicking Caverns]] in [[4709 AR]]. After entering the caverns, Zethivaxus disappeared completely for nine months. When he re-emerged nine months later, it was in the body of a [[Clockwork|clockwork]] abomination and leading an army of haunted clockwork machines. After re-emerging, Zethivaxus led his army on a rampage, ravaging the western highlands of [[Xa Hoi]].
