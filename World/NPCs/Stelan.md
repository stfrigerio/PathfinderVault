> **Baron Stelan of Adrast** serves as the lord of the barony of [[Adrast]] in the [[Northern Tandak Prefecture]] prefecture of [[Taldor]]. He earned some renown in his younger days as a semi-famous adventurer, though he has now effectively retired into the life of a minor aristocrat. He and his wife are well liked by the populace and are regarded as just and fair rulers.
> He fell under a wasting curse in [[4711 AR]], initiating a quest to find a cure.


## Family

> Stelan is married to his baroness, [[Lenelle]] and they have a teenage son called [[Renar]]. Stelan and his family are staunch followers of the god [[Abadar]] and much of the populace have come to follow his example, spreading the faith considerably. Stelan's family crest is a horse rearing up on a flat plain under a symbol of a beaming sun.
