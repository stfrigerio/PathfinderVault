> **Baron Utilinus** was the final ruler of [[Sargava]], having adopted the customary title of Custodian. However, his grip on power was tenuous, as he was forced to deal with the claims of the [[Free Captains]] while simultaneously confronting the insurrections in [[Kalabuto]]. Utilinus was a competent enough ruler, but ultimately, the challenges facing his reign proved to be too great for him to master.
> Baron Utilinus replaced [[Grallus|Baron Grallus]] in [[4662 AR]]. In [[4715 AR]], he was overthrown by [[Mwangi]] rebels and colonist sympathisers of the rebellion, who put an end to the colonial government, and returned the land to native rule under the new name of [[Vidrian]].
