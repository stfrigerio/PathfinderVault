> **Pieln Melcat** was the last ruler of the [[Melcat|Archduchy of Melcat]], a former [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] which now forms the territory of the independent country of [[Razmiran]]. When the self-proclaimed Living God [[Razmir]] confronted Melcat and demanded him to bend the knee, Melcat saw through Razmir's deception and proclaimed that his soldiers would crush the charlatan, but failed to anticipate Razmir's power: the next day, Razmir utterly obliterated his capital city, which came to be known as [[Aerduin's Folly|Aerduins Folly]]. Melcat lingers behind as a [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]], and the city's traumatic destruction both warped his mind and turned him into a [[Psychic|psychic]]. He now gathers [[Undead|undead]] to his cause, seeking to overthrow Razmir.
