> **Thassritoum**, the Mewling Storm, is a powerful [[Kimenhul|kimenhul]] [[Sahkil|sahkil]] that rules over the [[Demiplane|demiplane]] [[Palace of Nightmares]]. It is the patron of the [[Taldor|Taldan]] secret society known as the Immaculate Circle.


## Background

> Thassritoum was once a [[Yamaraj|yamaraj]], and retains some of its authority as a [[Psychopomp|psychopomp]], although it has revised its background, insisting that it has always been a sahkil. Three centuries ago, it entered a bargain with [[Panivar Lotheed]], founder of the Immaculate Circle: Panivar granted Thassritoum access to the sleeping minds of his rivals, and Thassritoum shields Panivar from the sight of psychopomps and death itself, preventing him from dying. Around [[4718 AR]], as part of the Immaculate Circle's plan, Thassritoum retrieved the soul of [[Carrius Stavian|Prince Carrius Stavian]] from [[Nirvana]], undoing [[Pharasma|Pharasmas]] judgement.


## Associates

> Within the Palace of Nightmares, Thassritoum gathers lesser sahkils, other [[Evil|evil]] [[Outsider|outsiders]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] alike. Some of its most powerful minions are: the Dancers, a pair of [[Pakalchi|pakalchis]] stitched together into one creature; the Lucid Rani, a [[Vudra|Vudran]] [[Psychic|psychic]] killed by Thassritoum through fear and turned into a [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]]; Spawn Without End, a [[Xill|xill]] whose eggs degrade the victim's sanity without ever hatching; and Nandrahl, Thassritoum's former [[Grim reaper|grim reaper]] lover. Within its court, sahkils, [[Daemon|daemons]], [[Devil|devils]], and [[Demon|demons]] offer dreadful memories and broken [[Mortal|mortal]] lives in an attempt to court Thassritoum's approval; only the most depraved or talented liars are allowed an audience with Thassritoum.
> Thassritoum has also kidnapped the yamaraj psychopomp Harubic, whom it forces to watch parading petitioners and outsiders condemned to afterlives broken by the sahkils, in the hope of breaking Harubic's confidence in its judgements, in the process fuelling Thassritoum's apotheosis.
