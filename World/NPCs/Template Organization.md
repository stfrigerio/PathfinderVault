> **Yael** is the seneschal of the [[Eldest]] [[Shyka]]. An enigma almost as big as her master, Yael always appears as the same person, but her age, personality, and abilities are never the same between visits. Some Eldest speculate that Yael may actually have various different versions, rescued from dark fates in alternative timelines in exchange for service to Shyka. Regardless, she is absolutely loyal to Shyka, and her powers are usually enough to deal with intruders.
