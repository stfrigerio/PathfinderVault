> In his position as Gavel (the local leader) of the [[Lumber Consortium]] in [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]], **Thuldrin Kreed** actually owns the town. Kreed abuses this position often and publicly. He is a sadistic, cruel man and not shy of open murder or rape if someone dares to oppose him or simply is in the wrong place at the wrong time.
> Ironically and contrary to this behavior, it is not unusual to see Kreed doing curative works if someone suffers without Kreed being the cause. He also spends a lot of money to protect Falcon's Hollow's lumberjacks and inhabitants from the monsters of the region.
> Kreed is cruel but he is also a coward often hiding behind the back of his right hand [[Payden Teedum]]. He has seldom reason to do so, as people normally dare not oppose him (with the exception of [[Deldrin Baleson|Sheriff Deldrin Baleson]]).


## Family

> Thuldrin Kreed is descended from a long line of ruthless lumber barons. His father, [[Thalsin Kreed]], taught him how to break people's spirits. His son, [[Jurin Kreed|Jurin]], is his only living relative but the child resembles his mother, being slim and bookish. Thuldrin has serious difficulties to raise his son as a proper [[Kreed family|Kreed]]. Jurin's mother died under dubious circumstances just after his birth.
> Thuldrin always want to have the control and despises bad luck which is the local [[Fey|feys]] most insidious weapon against his family. He refuses to gamble and never engages in business beyond uncompromising greed. He carefully plans his moves.
