> **Lord Nikos Surtova** ruled [[Issia]] until [[Choral the Conqueror]] arrived in [[4499 AR]]. Upon meeting, Surtova agreed to surrender Issia to Choral in exchange for [[House Surtova]] retaining a powerful place under Choral. Surtova married [[Myrna Rogarvia]], daughter of Choral. This became important in [[4699 AR]] as their descendant, [[Noleski Surtova]], claimed the throne when [[House Rogarvia]] disappeared.
