> The [[Sphinx|sphinx]] **Shadnusaptera** is the final guardian of the *[[Great Seal]]*, located in the dungeons below [[Gallowspire]] in [[Ustalav]]. She was placed there by the generals of the victorious armies of the [[Shining Crusade]] to keep the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] from escaping his prison, and to prevent any of the [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lichs]] followers from freeing him. She is [[Magic|magically]] preserved and nourished by the magic of the *Great Seal*, and should the *Seal* ever be broken, would age hundreds of years in the blink of an eye. Shadnusaptera attacks anyone not carrying a piece of the *[[Shield of Aroden]]* on sight, and since these shards are carefully guarded in [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], she is a great danger to almost anyone.
