> **Fat Aghurr** is the overseer of the [[Garden of Chains]], a [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]] [[Slavery|slave market]]. He is always protected by a pair of bodyguards, which allows him to treat all with vicious cruelty. Those who cross him are either killed or sold as slaves. He is also greedy enough to risk taking moneyed buyers underneath the Garden of Chains to see more stock.
