> **Nyrissa** is a powerful [[Bestiary/Nymph|nymph]] of the [[Fey|fey]] realm of the [[First World]]. She fell in love with [[Count Ranalc]], one of the [[Eldest]] who rule the realm. She grew in power, earning the title of Nymph Queen, and eventually proclaimed herself to be a new member of the Eldest.
> The existing Eldest opposed her claim and sent a [[Jabberwock]] to kill her. She managed to survive that attack (and later used the blood to create a [[JabberwockLesser Jabberwock|Lesser Jabberwock]]), but fell into the clutches of the Eldest. They stripped away her capacity to love, creating the [[Bastard sword|bastard sword]] *[[Nethys/Artifacts/Briar]]* in the process, and hid the blade—a [[Major artifact|major artifact]] with the power to either destroy or restore her—in the [[Material Plane]]. Nyrissa wants to "catch" the Stolen Lands as a gift for one of the Eldest, the lords of the First World, in order to work the return of her "most precious treasure" from the Eldest that have taken it from her.
> For uplifting Nyrissa and enabling her trespass, Count Ranalc was exiled to the [[Plane of Shadow]].
> Nyrissa has a long-standing plot to transfer that portion of the Material Plane that is coterminous with her fey realm of Thousandbreaths into the First World. She hopes that such a coup would appease the Eldest. This has dire implications for the material lands concerned, which form part of the [[River Kingdoms]].
