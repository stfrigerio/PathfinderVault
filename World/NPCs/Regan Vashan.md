> **Armiger Regan Vashan** is an [[Hellknight ranks|armiger]] of the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Godclaw]], and a descendant of two of the Order's co-founders, [[Seldinin Choaz]] and Renrallie Dinyar-Stareye. She became a [[Paladin|paladin]] of [[Iomedae]] before joining the Order of the Godclaw in order to lead it to her vision of faith. She was tasked with coming to her ancestral home, the town of [[Gundrun]] in lost [[Sarkoris]], to retrieve for the Order of the Godclaw a relic that once belonged to her ancestor, and that no one else could claim.
