> **Bukrugsor** is the [[Blood Queen|Blood Queens]] current high priest in [[Ganagsau]], home to the most devout [[Kuru|kuru]] of the [[Cannibal Isles]] in the [[Shackles]]. He serves as the intermediate between the kuru and their "goddess" making demands that include [[Human|human]] sacrifices and other acts of repugnant devotion, ensuring his deity is regularly brought victims and blood.
