> **Ultrar Duneshifter** was an ally of [[Morgan the White]], and he was one of the many pirates to sign up to Morgan's [[Pirate Pact]] and relocate to what is now termed the [[Protectorate of the Black Marquis]], in the [[River Kingdoms]].
> He took exception to the murder of Morgan in [[4702 AR]] by the pirate who came to be known as the [[Crimson Marquis]]. He imprisoned the Crimson Marquis, and briefly ruled the Protectorate himself, taking the title of **Rogue Marquis**. However, he was unable to maintain his grip on power, and the Protectorate descended into chaos.
