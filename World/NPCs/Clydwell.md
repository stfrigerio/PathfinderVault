>  **Saint Clydwell** was a general who took part in the [[Mendevian Crusades]]. [[Clydwell Keep]] is named after him.  He was originally a follower of [[Aroden]], but switched to [[Iomedae]] on Aroden's death. He was not a native of [[Mendev]], having arrived from the south. When he arrived, the crusaders faced no end of problems, one being the besieging [[demon's]] ability to [[teleport]] into the heart of even the most secure fortress. To solve this deadly problem and give the crusaders a place of safety Clydwell recovered the *[[Demonscope]]*, which is housed in the keep that would later take his name. He died fighting a powerful [[Bestiary/Fiend]] in the town of [[Gravehearst]] in what was then [[Sarkoris]]; his death while protecting the sacred barbarian artifact resulted in the awakening to full power of the *Demonscope*.
>  The main temple to Iomedae in [[Kenabres]], a crusader city in Mendev, is dedicated to Saint Clydwell; the [[Cathedral of Saint Clydwell]] is located in the [[Old Kenabres]] district.
