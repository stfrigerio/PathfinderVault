> **Eliandra** is perhaps the most powerful [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Pulura]] remaining on [[Golarion]], and her strength was tested daily during the [[Demon|demonic]] occupation of the [[Worldwound]] as the head priestess of the perpetually demon- and [[Undead|undead]]-besieged temple at [[Pulura's Fall|Puluras Fall]]. Since the closing of the Worldwound at the end of the [[Fifth Mendevian Crusade]] in [[4718 AR]], her current fate remains unknown.
