 [[Ruthazek]], the Gorilla King.
> The **Gorilla King**, or **Silverback King**, is the title of the feral monarch of the city of [[Usaro]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. It is believed that since the founding of the city many centuries ago the King has always been a [[Gorilla|gorilla]], [[Magic|magically]] awakened into sentience to become the most honoured of [[Angazhan]]'s servants in [[Golarion]].
> In fact, the truth is even more sinister. 
> Those who consider themselves worthy of the office must make their way to the top of the pyramid-shaped palace at the heart of dread Usaro. There they must touch [[Totem of Angazhan|Angazhans totem]], a granite representation of the head of a [[PathfinderWiki/Manuals/Demon|demonic]] [[Ape|ape]].  This feat is traditionally only achieved after stepping over the dead body of the current incumbent; it is not clear what would happen if a more worthy candidate presented himself to the totem while the current Gorilla King was still alive.
> It appears that the qualities Angazhan favours are strength, charisma, and ruthlessness. Unworthy applicants are ripped to pieces, some say by the hand of Angazhan himself. A worthy applicant is also slain—only to be immediately reincarnated into the body of a great ape, with the intelligence, skills, and abilities he possessed in life now allied with immense physical strength and toughness.
> The current holder of the title is a previously [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Human|human]] [[Dire ape|dire ape]] called [[Ruthazek]].


## History

> The Gorilla King is responsible for shattering the traditional [[Sabosan|sabosan]] city of [[Jaytirian]] and scattering that race into the Mwangi Expanse.
> The Gorilla King took the magical [[Siege engine|siege engine]] called *[[Worldbreaker]]* as a trophy from his force's battle with [[Taldor|Taldors]] [[Sixth Army of Exploration]]. In [[4684 AR]], he also took the [[Gunworks]]' largest bombard as a trophy of his assault on [[Alkenstar]].
