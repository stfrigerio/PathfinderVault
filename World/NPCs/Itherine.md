> **Hierarch Itherine of the Shadowflame** is the overseer of the Shadowflame Cathedral, a temple of [[Zon-Kuthon]] built around the spot where the [[Deity|god]] made the pact with the [[Black Triune]] that created the nation of [[Nidal]]. Itherine has spent decades building a notoriety for the cathedral both in and out of Nidal, and claims to have been born of shadows within its walls, although some speculate that she was taken by the church as a foundling.
