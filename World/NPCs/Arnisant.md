*This is an article on General Arnisant. For information on the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|dog]] of the same name, see [[Arnisant dog]].*
> **Arnisant** was a [[Taldan]] general who commanded the forces of the [[Shining Crusade]] against the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] and sacrificed himself to weaken the powerful [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] enough to imprison him beneath his fortress of [[Gallowspire]].


## The Shining Crusade

> General Arnisant was commander of the Taldan forces allied against the armies of the Whispering Tyrant during the decades-long conflict known as the Shining Crusade. Arnisant played a pivotal role in the crusade's conclusion when he personally faced Tar-Baphon on the field of battle in [[38' AR]]. In this conflict, the lich attempted to [[Summon|summon]] Arnisant's beating heart directly into his waiting claws, but the [[Spell|spell]] was blocked by the *[[Shield of Aroden]]*—a powerful relic that had been wielded by the [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]] himself. The [[Shield|shield]] shattered, and in place of Arnisant's heart, the Whispering Tyrant found himself holding a sliver of the shattered [[Artifact|artifact]], which melded with his flesh and burned him in holy fire, weakening him enough for the Arodenite priest [[Narthoc]] to seal the [[Undead|undead]] warlord beneath his unholy tower.


## Legacy

> Arnisant's legacy is likely strongest in the nations of Taldor and [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], both of whom hold him and his ultimate sacrifice in great esteem and claim some degree of ownership over his memory. Even centuries after his death, Arnisant's name is held high by the faltering empire of Taldor as an example of the empire's glory. In Lastwall, which was founded a year after Arnisant's death, the symbol of office of the nation's reigning [[Watcher-Lord]] is Aroden's shattered shield—now called the *[[Shattered Shield of Arnisant]]* and considered to be among the holiest relics of the Shining Crusade.
> Monuments to General Arnisant's legacy can be found throughout the [[Inner Sea region]]. In Arnisant's hometown of [[Ridonport]], a 200-foot-tall, ornately carved marble obelisk stands as a major landmark in the city's main square. In the Taldan capital of [[Oppara]], a memorial called the [[Shining Obelisk]] rises 100 feet above the city's [[Memorial Park]] district, its brass surface shining brightly in the [[Sun|sun]].
