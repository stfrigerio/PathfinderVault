> **Head Botanist Miraina Olviris** is the head of the [[Botany|botany]] department in Kimanéz University, the most experienced [[Arcane magic|arcane]] botanist in [[Jolizpan]], and the member of the city council who represents its infrastructure interests. She is known for being a jovial, generous person and gifted academic and teacher, and often invites people she meets to her home.



## Appearance

> Miraina is a short, stout, grandmotherly woman with grey hair, a deeply lined, expressive face and keen eyes. She often wears flowers in her hair and clothing adorned with Jolizpan's floral patterns.


## Relatives

> Miraina is married to a farmer who works at Kimanéz Farm and has several children with him. Her son, High Mediator Jesolis Olviris, serves alongside her in Jolizpan's city council.


## Associates

> Miraina knows an expansive network of contacts whom she could call on to help with almost all situations.


## Background

> Miraina grew up with the stories of the good old days when the Veins of Creation still existed and provided for [[Xopatl]]. Emulating the arcane botanists in these stories and determined to return her nation to the golden age, Miraina began studying [[Magic|magic]] and botany. She was further motivated when the botanists in the Blue Gardens of Tlil developed the first miniature [[Ley line|ley line]] network when she was an adolescent. Seeing the concrete progress, Miraina applied at the Kimanéz University, where she excelled before joining the Blue Gardens a few years later. She made significant contributions to the development of the small ley line networks and the restoration of Jolizpan but still believed there was a way to restore the original Veins of Creation.
> For the next few years, Miraina visited [[Tumbaja Mountain]] and directly studied the dead kumaru tree that once provided for the Veins of Creation. She made a breakthrough when she identified a strange energy within the tree and pieced the role played by [[Aroden]] in the failure of the Veins of Creation, but could not find a way to expel his spiritual echo and bring the tree to life. Miraina then took a break from work at the Blue Gardens and continued her research at home to raise her children, before returning when they became adults.
