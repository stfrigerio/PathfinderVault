> Many rumors surround the legend of **Duma the Sly**, a mysterious bandit chief who leads raids on merchants, travellers and tax-collectors inside the [[Gronzi Forest]] in Western [[Brevoy]] on [[House Medvyed|House Medvyeds]] lands. **Duma** and his band oppose King [[Noleski Surtova]]. He is, however, beloved by the common people who help him avoid capture by the king's soldiers.
> Little is known of his parentage and tales of his origin claim that he may be a lost heir to the [[House Rogarvia|Rogarvian]] throne, a [[Fey|fey]] trickster creature, or the son of a wronged [[Aldori swordlords|Aldori]] nobleman.
