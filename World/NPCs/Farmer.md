> The [[Bellflower Network]] is led by its mysterious leader, known only as the Farmer. In truth, only the very highest echelons of the Network know whether the Farmer is an individual halfling or whether it is Network code for many members who take on the title of 'Farmer' to preserve secrecy.
> Rumours abound about the Farmer: many suggest the Farmer began as a slave in [[Corentyn]] and won his own freedom. Other rumours link the Bellflower Network and the Farmer to the [[Eagle Knights]] of [[Andoran]], with some going as far as suggesting the Farmer, himself, is an Eagle Knight.
