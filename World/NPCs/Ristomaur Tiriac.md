> To most of the people of [[Varno]] **Conte Ristomaur Tiriac** is just the latest in a long line of absentee, lackluster rulers. What few know is that Ristomaur harbours a surprising secret. Ristomaur is not the latest in a long line of rulers but is in fact the entire line, having ruled Varno in a variety of different guises for the past two centuries. Ristomaur Tiriac is in fact a [[Vampire|vampire]] driven by a lifelong obsession to rid himself of his [[Curses of Golarion|vampirism]]. He has travelled far and wide searching for a cure and maintains an odd cadre of assistants who help him in this quest, including Ramoska Arkminos, a [[Nosferatu|nosferatu]] so ancient he cannot remember what it was like to be alive. This endless travelling away from his estate, [[Korsinoria Palace]] near the town of [[Corvischior]], is not only essential to Ristomaur's continuing work on a vampiric cure, it allows him to stay distant from his subjects, preventing them from realising his unnatural condition.
