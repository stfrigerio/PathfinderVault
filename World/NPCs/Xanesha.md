> The [[Lamia matriarch|lamia matriarch]] **Xanesha** was one of the early recruits of the awoken [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Karzoug]], who recruited a number of her kind to infiltrate [[Varisia]] and gather greedy [[Soul|souls]] to power his [[Runewell|runewell]].



## Background


### Origins

> Xanesha was a member of the large population of [[Lamyros|lamyros]] living in the lost city of [[Xin-Shalast]] at the time of Karzoug's reawakening. She was chosen by the runelord, and taught the rituals needed to prepare a soul for his runewell. After she had mastered this skill, she was sent from her home high in the [[Kodar Mountains]] into the more populated lowlands in order to help in her new master's return. Traveling Varisia in her [[Human|human]] form, she eventually settled in the city of [[Magnimar]].


### Magnimar

> Now living in a heavily-populated city, Xanesha needed a cover identity so that she would not arouse suspicion. She found one in a like-minded group of murderers: a [[Skinsaw cult]] known as the [[Skinsaw Men]]. Xanesha easily seduced their leader, a magistrate named Ironbriar, who believed her to have been sent by their patron [[Deity|deity]], [[Norgorber]], and soon became the leader of the cult.


### Undeath

> Xanesha was eventually slain by a band of adventurers, but did not rest in death and rose as a [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]]. She haunted the area around the [[Shadow Clock]] in the [[Underbridge]] until [[Erigantus]], a [[Necromancy|necromancer]] allied with a cult of [[Yamasoth]], extracted Xanesha's skull from the ruined interior of the Shadow Clock and bound the lamia's spirit to the walls of the [[Gecko Irespan piling|Gecko]], one of the pilings of the [[Irespan]], to serve as a guardian. Xanesha resents her fate, and is deeply bitter about both her demise and current service, but Erigantus' [[Magic|magic]] keeps her confined within the walls of the Gecko and prevents her from venting her anger on anyone but trespassers.
