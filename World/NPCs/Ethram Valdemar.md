> **Ethram Valdemar** is the aging head of the [[House Valdemar|Valdemar family]] and is the only original member of the [[Sandpoint Mercantile League]] still alive. He is dying from a lung infection that resists permanent curing.
> In an attempt to overcome death, Ethram has become obsessed about a book of poetry called *[[Songs at Sun's Ebb|Songs at Suns Ebb]]*, written by a poet named [[Vumeshki]]. The book included poems about a place called [[Ilvarandin]], which the poet claimed was a hidden paradise where citizens would stay forever young. Learning that Vumeshki often took a [[Drug|drug]] called [[Midnight milk|midnight milk]], Ethram began taking it himself believing that it might help his dreaming mind locate Ilvarandin. He secretly enlisted his son, Kaleb Valdemar, in procuring the substance, and he is now an addict.
