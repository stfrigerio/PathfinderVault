> **Elvanna** was queen of [[Irrisen]] from [[4613 AR]] to [[4713 AR]], following the 100-year rule of her older sister [[Yelizaveta]]. She was the fourteenth daughter of [[Baba Yaga]] left to rule that wintry land.


## History

> As queen, Elvanna rarely left her palace in [[Whitethrone]]. She instead worked on her legacy; taxes were raised to record levels, but few were able to discover where the money had been spent. Like all queens before her, Elvanna placed her children and grandchildren in positions of power throughout Irrisen, and little happened within the wintry kingdom without the queen soon hearing about it.


### Succession concerns

> Like prior daughters of the old crone brought to power in Irrisen, Elvanna followed her older sister Yelizaveta. As with past successors, she never knew what fate befell her older sibling, but the rumors of what could have happened prompted Elvanna to be more active in her plans to solidify her station. In her studies, Elvanna uncovered the failed rebellion of the [[Tashanna|ninth queen]] against their mother, an event called the Witchwar. This information served only to steel Elvanna's determination to remain in power for as long as possible. To this end, she made contact with her half brother [[Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin]] on the distant [[Planet|planet]] of [[Earth]], introducing him to his heritage and training him in magic.
> Elvanna's 100-year term expired in 4713 AR, when Baba Yaga was scheduled to replace her. She plotted against her mother with [[Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin]], and together the two were able to trap Baba Yaga. Rasputin hid [[Anastasia Nikolaevna]], a forgotten—and at one point, slain—daughter of Baba Yaga in a monastery in a prison camp, from which she was later rescued by a band of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] from [[Golarion]] who sought to thwart Elvanna and Rasputin's plan.
> After these adventurers successfully defeated Elvanna and Rasputin, Baba Yaga accepted their request to crown Anastasia as Irrisen's new queen, ending Elvanna's reign.
