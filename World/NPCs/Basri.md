> **Father Basri** could possibly be the last Archbishop of [[Aroden]] left on [[Golarion]]. The old [[Half-elf|half-elf]] still remembers when Aroden personally spoke to him through prayer. Long ago, Father Basri has charged himself with responsibility of maintaining the [[Basilica of the Last Man]] and its collection of Arodenite holy relics and artifacts. In an effort to preserve the sacred temple, he had the idea to transform it into a tourist destination. Lately, Father Basri has been telling his remaining clergy that he believes Aroden will someday return, but some see this as nothing more than wishful thinking from a man who has yet to come to terms with his patron's death.
