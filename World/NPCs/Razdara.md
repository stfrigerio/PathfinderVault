> **Razdara** is the high priest of the city of [[Valishava]], a temple-city that sit upon the banks of the [[Matra River]] in the [[Vudra|Vudran]] region of [[Wide Water]]. Razdara is known for embarking on pilgrimages to the [[Outer Plane|Outer Planes]] with her acolytes in tow. However, on her last visit she returned alone, looking haunted and bearing a vague prophecy of some forthcoming doom that will affect all the people of Wide Water.
