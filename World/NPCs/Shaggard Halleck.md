> **Shaggard Halleck** was one of the two captains who founded the settlement of [[Lilywhite]] on [[Motaku Isle]] in [[4682 AR]]. He captained the [[Ship|barkentine]] *[[Mollusk]]*. Shaggard and his friend [[Delemona Burie]] were devotees of [[Cayden Cailean]] and they built a grand stone [[Temple of Cayden Cailean Lilywhite|temple]] to the Drunken Hero. Shaggard was killed in an [[Alcohol|alcohol]]-fueled duel with a local fisherman in [[4692 AR]] in that same temple. Since then, his son [[Little Shaggard]] and Burie have acted as joint [[Pirate lord|pirate lords]] of the town.
