![[Radovan_jacket.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Radovan Virholt wearing his prized jacket bought in [[Goka]]
> **Radovan Virholt** serves as [[Pathfinder Society]] [[Venture-Captain]] [[Varian Jeggare|Varian Jeggares]] personal bodyguard. He often uses his status as both a [[Tiefling|tiefling]] and servant to assist in Jeggare's private investigations, though abhors wearing the official livery of his master's manor, [[Greensteeples]]. Sold into slavery at an early age, Radovan made his way into the [[Goatherds]] street gang in the streets of [[Egorian]] before being taken in by his current employer and showed how to turn his talents for combat and theft toward more noble purposes. Fun-loving, sarcastic, and unafraid to get his hands dirty when the situation calls for a fight, Radovan is deeply loyal to his friends, and happy to fight and die in their service.
