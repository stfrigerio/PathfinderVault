> **Zandros the Fair** is the leader of the [[Goatherds]], a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] gang that operates out of the [[Cheapside]] in the city of [[Egorian]] in Cheliax.



## Appearance

> Zandros used to have black hair, but this has faded to white as it has thinned with age. He favors a pointed beard, also white under a buck-toothed smile. He also has tumors growing out of his forehead, making his appearance more [[Devil|devilish]] than it truly is.


## Background

> Though his appearance suggests otherwise, Zandros is just an old man of [[Sczarni]] heritage who was caught cheating a [[Varisian]] [[Witch|witch]]. Upon discovery of the deception, the witch cursed him, creating the horn-like tumors on his head and the suspicion of an infernal bloodline.


## Personality

> As his nickname implies, Zandros the Fair is a fair leader, and he is meticulous in collecting his debts. This payment is taken by way of the money owed to him, or in the "forfeiture" of a body part. Usually this forfeit is both ears, although this can be adjusted for partial payments or unusual circumstances. He sends the veterans of his gang, such as [[Maccabus]], to collect these loans on his behalf.


## Family

> Zandros has one daughter named [[Anca]], of whom he is fiercely protective.
