> **Vahlo Huovar** is a member of the [[Decemvirate]] and secretly an agent of the Whispering Tyrant [[Tar-Baphon]].



## Associates

> Due to his *Triple-Spire Helm*, his [[Undead|undeath]] was never revealed to the rest of the [[Pathfinder Society]]. Only two people managed to learn his true identity: [[Eylysia]] and [[Grandmaster Torch]], who were unable to warn the rest of the Society, as their warnings would never get to be heard while Vahlo was still pulling the strings. For 200 years, Vahlo has been directing [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] to recover [[Magic item|magic items]] that could help Tar-Baphon once he escapes, one of which being an [[Artifact|artifact]] tied to [[Zura]] capable of summoning [[Undead|undead]] versions of long-dead heroes by drawing life force from the living.


## Background

> Vahlo Huovar once fought on the side of the [[Shining Crusade]] against the Whispering Tyrant, but was later transformed into a [[Graveknight|graveknight]] and an agent of Tar-Baphon.
> In [[4719 AR]], after Tar-Baphon escaped from his prison and the majority of Pathfinders came to beleaguered [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] to fight him, Vahlo put his plan in motion to seize the [[Grand Lodge]], activate the artefact, and devastate [[Absalom]], in order to hand the city to his master. To further secure his plan, he sent the strongest Pathfinders who remained at Absalom to [[Mediogalti]] to eliminate Eylysia and Grandmaster Torch, who were likely to foil his plot, in the process also keeping these same Pathfinders occupied. As a contingency plan, he also contracted the [[Red Mantis]] to kill Eylysia in case of his agents' failure.


## Possessions

> Vahlo's *[[Decemvirate Helm]]*, called the *Triple-Spire Helm*, has attuned itself so closely to him that it is considered part of his graveknight [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]].
