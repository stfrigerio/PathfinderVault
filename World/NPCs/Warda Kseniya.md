> **Warda Kseniya** is the captain of [[Belila|Belilas]] town guard on the northwestern border of [[Irrisen|Irrisens]] [[Bleakmarch]] province. He is a [[Jadwiga]] man and one of the few non-believers of the new foreign faith brought into town, known as the [[Way of Transcendent Bliss]].
> Between Warda and the blacksmith [[Anastazy Bronzehammer]] an unlikely friendship has been formed. Their deep suspicions and opposition to the Way of Transcendent Bliss have to remain secret given that the baroness and baron are devoted followers.
