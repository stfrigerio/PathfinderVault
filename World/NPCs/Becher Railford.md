> Becher Railford fled the [[Taldan]] settlement of [[Railford]] in his youth, and for years escaped his family responsibility by serving as a soldier in the [[Taldan Phalanx|Emperors Phalanx]]. He then returned to the town, only to find his father, noted [[Pathfinder]] [[Iadon Railford]], dying from old age and the family winery close to ruin. He and some of his colleagues from his time in the service attempted to repair and revitalize the winery until the nearby river changed its course, flooding the entire countryside and turning the grape fields into swampland. Seeing the damage, Becher and Iadon argued about the future of the business, which ended the day that Becher struck his father, who fell down a flight of stairs and broke his neck. Not long after the tragedy, the Railford Distillery reopened to distill grain liquors instead of wine. Becher continues to feel guilty over the death of his father, and it has caused him to fall into [[Alcoholic beverages|drinking]]. Currently, only the distillery is bringing traffic into the settlement.
