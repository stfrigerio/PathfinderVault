> **Taladere** was a [[Thuvia|Thuvian]] priestess of [[Pharasma]] at the time of the discovery of the [[Sun orchid elixir|sun orchid elixir]] in [[1140 AR]].
> The elixir temporarily halts ageing, and Taladere was concerned that such immortality was against the ethos of Pharasma that life was a journey from birth to death. Taladere was able to persuade the rulers of the newly formed nation of Thuvia to decree that no Thuvian would take the elixir, apart from its creator [[Artokus Kirran]].
As a result, when supplies of the elixir are auctioned off each year only foreigners are allowed to bid for it.
