> **Siov Cassimeel** is at best a small fry among the many despicable criminals who make their living in the seedy [[Underbridge]] district of [[Magnimar]]. Siov owns and runs a small, dingy tavern named the [[Friendly Merchant]], but he makes most of his money hiring out the small, concealed docks that back onto the tavern. Siov hires these docks to any smugglers who need a safe, out-of-the-way location and can afford his high prices. Siov also serves as an informant for the [[Night Scales]], a local thieves' guild, keeping them informed about whatever local smugglers are bringing in. He also rents out the dock to Night Scales members at a significantly reduced price. Despite his [[Magic|magical]] abilities and shady connections, Siov is ultimately a coward with little stomach for the violence so common in the underworld.
