> The old [[Green dragon|green dragon]] **Athervox** lives in an [[Observatory|observatory]] in the [[Whisperwood]] near the town of [[Senara]] in [[Cheliax]]. An offspring of the famous [[Dragon|dragon]] [[Astronomer|astronomer]] [[Gartheris]], she spent her younger years working in his shadow. Gartheris has been dead for nearly seven centuries, but left his daughter with a huge range of astronomical equipment. Athervox spends most of her days studying quietly, and has guaranteed herself peace thanks to a tenuous agreement with [[House Thrune]].
> When the agreement was made, Athervox also agreed to mentor several apprentices from [[Egorian]], but they were nothing more than spies and thieves who soon made off with vast amounts of her research related to the other [[Planet|planets]] of [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Solar system|solar system]]. This was several decades ago, and despite the theft no one has bothered Athervox since. However, her lack of revenge does not mean that she has forgotten this slight.
