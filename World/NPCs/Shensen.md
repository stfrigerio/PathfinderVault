> **Shensen** is a covert insurgent aiming to overturn the government of [[Cheliax]] by working undercover as a [[Chelish opera]] performer in the [[Kintargo Opera House]], where she was to play the role of [[Aolar]] in the [[Opera|opera]] *Huntress of Heroes*.


## Associates

> [[Chuko]], the [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]] owner of the renowned [[War Cage]], is a former adventuring companion of Shensen. They have long been friends, but no longer adventure together, as Chuko has lost interest in rebellion.


## Background

> Shensen was born as a [[Drow|drow]], and as a young child was brought to the [[Whisperwood]] by a band of her kind who perished in battle against a group of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] that included a [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] of [[Sarenrae]] named Izorah. Shensen was killed alongside the other drow by Izorah's [[Magic|magical]] fire, which the druid realized with shame when sorting through the aftermath of the battle. Izorah used her magic to reincarnate the child, who was reborn into the body of an [[Aquatic half-elf|aquatic half-elf]]. Izorah gave her her current name, and raised her as her daughter.
> Shensen lived with Izorah until agents of House Thrune came to the grove where the two lived, petrifying Izorah and carrying away her body while Shensen hid. Shensen took up an adventuring life after this, traveling with a group of adventurers until they were forced to disband following a fire in [[Egorian]]. Shensen settled in Kintargo afterwards, becoming a popular singer at the Kintargo Opera House, but retained her opposition to the practices of House Thrune and her Sarenite faith. During her stay in Kintargo, she covertly infiltrated and spied on Chelish noble houses and organizations, served as a leading figure in Kintargo's underground worship of Sarenrae, and engaged regularly in the city's black market.
> During the [[Night of Ashes]], Shensen went missing as agents of [[House Thrune]] burned down the [[Silver Star]], her shop and [[Sarenrae|Sarenite]] shrine. Few know that she was captured by [[Barzillai Thrune]] and petrified by his [[Cockatrice|cockatrices]] to be his trophy. After a group of heroes freed her from Barzillai's clutches, she became leader of the newly resurrected [[Silver Ravens]]. She has since spent her time organising rebellions across Cheliax, growing Sarenrae's faith in [[Kintargo]], and establishing the city as a bastion of fine [[Art|art]] and [[Music|music]].
