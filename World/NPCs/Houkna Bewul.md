> **Houkna Bewul** is the brutal master of the town of [[Dragonsthrall]] on the [[Dahak's Horn|Dahaks Horn]] island in the [[Shackles]]. She captains the [[Ship|frigate]] *[[Black Dragon ship|Black Dragon]]* which is one of the few seaworthy vessels in the [[Cult of Dahak|cult]]'s seedy fleet. Houkna's primary objective for now is to acquire sturdier vessels. Her bandit parties patrol the waters around the [[Dahak's Teeth|Dahaks Teeth]], looking for foolish merchant ships that stray close enough to assault.
