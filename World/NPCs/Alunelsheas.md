> **Alunelsheas** was one half of the leaders of the burnt forest known as the [[Shroud of Unicorns]] in the [[Worldwound]]. Alunelsheas' twin, [[Caedaynenlo]], is co-leader, but neither has been seen for several years. Few [[Unicorn|unicorns]] remained toward the end of the [[Fifth Mendevian Crusade]] to be rallied against the [[Demon|demon]] hordes. Since the closing of the Worldwound in [[4718 AR]], their current status is unknown.
