> Coja Eyes-Aflame was a [[Shoanti]] shaman of the [[Sklar-Quah]]. It was he that was tasked with protecting the [[Fangs of Kazavon]] after the [[Dragon|dragons]] death and dismemberment in [[4508 AR]]. Eyes-Aflame visited with elders of all seven [[Quah|quahs]] to seek council on how to best deal with the Fangs. After more than a year of travelling and communing with the totem spirits of all of the quahs, Eyes-Aflame returned home for a time before leaving for the ancient [[Grand Mastaba]]. There he entered with the Fangs, never to re-emerge.
