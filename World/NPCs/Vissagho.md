> **Vissagho** is a [[Vrolikai|vrolikai]] and the [[Demon|demonic]] founder of the [[Vyre]]-based cult known as the [[Scarlet Sign]]. Vissagho founded the Scarlet Sign for mysterious reasons centuries ago and it serves as a way for nobles from across [[Cheliax]] to maintain secret political influence in the City of Masks. Vissagho's reputation is so fierce that the rulers of the city have never attempted to rent out or otherwise utilise the cult's headquarters, the [[Cathedral of Abadar Vyre|Cathedral of Abadar]], despite it being 'abandoned'.
