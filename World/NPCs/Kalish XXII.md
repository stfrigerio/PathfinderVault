> **Padishah Emperor Kalish XXII** is the ruler of the great [[Kelesh|Padishah Empire of Kelesh]], the dominant power in south-central [[Casmaron]]. Despite his advanced age of more than 80 years, Kalish remains a formidable presence. Kalish's habit of adding a wife each of his reign-years has given him a harem of over 50 consorts. Through these and his innumerable concubines he has spawned a sea of imperial princes and princesses, with over 200 dwelling in [[Katheer]] alone.
> In [[4692 AR]], Kalish XXII took a noblewoman from [[Qadira]] as a consort; had a son, Yaril, with her; and named Yaril his heir. The heir grew into a debauched man, and Kalish XXII's wife Queen Shubat has threatened to disown him if he continues, which would threaten to throw imperial succession into chaos.
