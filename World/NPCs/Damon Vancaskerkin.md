> **Damon Vancaskerkin** is the younger brother of [[Saul Vancaskerkin]].


## Relatives

> Damon's brother is the Riddleport gang leader Saul Vancaskerkin. Saul's children—his sons [[Orik Vancaskerkin|Orik]] and [[Verik Vancaskerkin]] and his daughter [[Natalya Vancaskerkin]]—are his nephews and niece.


## Background

> Damon Vancaskerkin was born in [[Riddleport]], [[Varisia]], five years after his brother Saul. He distanced himself from his brother's criminal enterprises early on, working as a caravan guide on the route connecting [[Galduria]] and [[Roderic's Cove|Roderics Cove]] while Saul became a growing presence in Riddleport's underworld. On the occasions where he and Saul contacted each other, Damon attempted to provide a positive influence for Saul's two sons.
> Damon eventually left Varisia once Saul began to lose his position among Riddleport's gangs. He crossed the [[Mindspin Mountains]] into the [[Hold of Belkzen]], where he has lived for several years, eventually becoming a regular presence in the town of [[Trunau]] on the eastern side of the Hold.
