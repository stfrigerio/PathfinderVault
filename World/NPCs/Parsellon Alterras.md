## Sorvus's Strike treaty

> The discovery of a [[Sorvus's Strike|silver lode]] near [[Crackspike]] around [[4711 AR]] led to an extended and bloody conflict with native [[Strix|strix]] of [[Windspire]].
> The conflict was resolved by a treaty that grants Cheliax the privilege to mine [[Silver|silver]] for 100 years and 1 day, or until at least 4811 AR, as long as miners avoid encroaching on strix hunting grounds and [[Tokarai Springs]]. Provisional Governor Alterras was one of four parties to sign the treaty, along with Paralictor Adarai of the [[Order of the Gate]], Velenne of the Chelish military, and [[Kirii]] of the [[Windspire tribe]] of strix.
