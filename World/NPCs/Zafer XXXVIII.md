>  **Sultan Zafer XXXVIII, Lord of the Heavens and All the Stars of the Mortal Void** is the ruler of the [[Djinni Empire]] and the cultural head of the [[Djinni]] people. Sultan Zafer rules from the [[Sussurran Palace]] atop the [[High Palaces]] of the djinni capital [[Armun Kelisk]]. No one can reach High Palaces without possession of an access key made of crystal, but these are only available from Sultan Zafer himself.
>  The Sultan rules his empire across the [[Plane of Air]] through a system of loyal viziers and sheikhs who each rule their own region of the unimaginably vast [[plane]]. Valuing knowledge and culture, Sultan Zafer is willing to make alliances to boost his people's cultural reach and his empire includes many wandering tribes of [[jann]]. The sultan's beneficent rule is in marked contract to that of the cruel [[Elemental lord]] [[Hshurha]], Duchess of All Winds, who claims the entire Plane of Air. Fortunately, on the whole, Hshurha leaves the Djinni Empire alone.
