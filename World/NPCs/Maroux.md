> **Maroux** is a [[Half-orc|half-orc]] [[Witch|witch]] who lives as a recluse on a small island off the [[Lady's Cape|Ladys Cape]] in far-southwestern [[Varisia]]. She has considerable knowledge about the local area, but can be hard to approach, as she greatly resents anyone who interrupts her solitude. Because of this, she refuses to get involved with the conflict between the local Baladab Souko [[Boggard|boggards]] and the [[Troglodyte|troglodyte]] tribe known as the Children of Zevgavizeb.
