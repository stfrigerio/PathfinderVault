> **Kerinha Napsunar** was a founding [[Pathfinder]] and peer of [[Selmius Foster]], [[Durvin Gest]], and [[Gregaro Voth]]. It was during an expedition to the [[Mwangi Expanse]] that they forged the mysterious Open Road Pact.



## Background

> Kerinha was a champion of the [[Pathfinder Society]]'s mission to preserve history. Despite being well-known and respected at the time, her list of accomplishments has mostly faded from public record, possibly due to intentional suppression of her work for political reasons and to protect her peers and sources.
> Her most prominent expedition was in [[4312 AR]] with Voth, Foster, and Gest, in pursuit of lost treasures in the Mwangi Expanse. They discovered the Door of Seasons but were unable to open it, and forged the Open Road Pact to pledge their cooperation. The party then split up and never adventured together again, out of fear that the unknown forces behind the Door would stir further unrest.
> Kerinha has been described as politically savvy and willing to take risks to save relics of historical value. Her more recently discovered achievements include the organising of a smuggling ring that took religious relics out of [[Rahadoum]] and into the Pathfinder Society's vaults. These items would have otherwise been destroyed. In [[4314 AR]], she also founded her own [[Pathfinder lodge]] in the [[River Kingdoms]], in the region now known as [[Artume]], though this lodge was subsequently lost and is currently in ruins.
> Her travels afterward led her to modern-day [[Andoran]], which at the time was still part of [[Cheliax]], where she founded a lodge near [[Sauerton]].


### Death

> In [[4352 AR]], Kerinha died in her bed in [[Quantium]], [[Nex]], surrounded by friends from the Society. In her will, she arranged for her findings to be published in the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]* 10 years after her death. However, due to clerical errors from staff changes, the Society never published them. These unpublished works, which included her involvement in the Open Road Pact, were not rediscovered until an inspection of unpublished chronicles in [[Nexus House]] during the year [[4719 AR]].


### Legacy

> After the statue of Durvin Gest at the [[Grand Lodge]] in [[Absalom]] was destroyed in [[4715 AR]], the [[Decemvirate]] replaced it with several statues, not only of Gest but of Kerinha and her other co-founding colleagues.
> In [[4719 AR]], a Pathfinder Society expedition to Artume rediscovered the lodge she founded there as well as her journals, including a description of her battle against a cult of the Golden Daughter and her subsequent move to Cheliax. An investigation soon led Pathfinders to rediscover another lodge she founded near [[Sauerton]], as well as additional documentation of her deeds that had been moved to the tower of [[Diggen's Rest|Diggens Rest]] to the east after Andoran seceded from Cheliax. Her recovered writings also helped to confirm details about the Society's founding, including the involvement of the [[Pig's Paunch|Pigs Paunch]] and [[Wounded Wisp]].


## Napsu-Sign language

***Main article: [[Napsu-Sign language]]***
> One of Kerinha's lasting legacies is the prevalence of the sign language she innovated, known as Napsu-Sign language or Pathfinder Hand Signs. It remains commonly used among Pathfinder agents, though few have mastered its entire lexicon.
