> **His Frozen Majesty, King Eshakhar I** is the evil ruler of the [[Hautansia|Sparkling Principality of Hautansia]] on the [[Plane of Air|Elemental Plane of Air]]. King Eshakhar I is a powerful [[Ice mephit|ice mephit]] [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]] who controls potent ice magics, using them to mend and control the ice that binds the rocky islands of kingdom of Hautansia together. King Eshakhar ensures the loyalty of his followers by ensuring that they are respected within the borders of Hautansia, unlike the rest of the plane where they are often forced into servitude. The rare and exquisite gems excavated from the mines of Hautansia means much more powerful rulers are forced to treat with King Eshakhar. Unfortunately King Eshakhar is as evil and he is sensitive and those who visit his court must show him the upmost respect as those who don't are frozen into solid ice blocks that King Eshakhar then carves into twisted sculptures of chiselled ice and cleaved flesh.
