> **Leeoda Cullerton** was the head of the [[Cullerton family]] in the [[River Kingdoms]] region of [[Lambreth]]. In [[4502 AR]], Leeoda proposed the union of the three rival merchant families in the region, after 10 years of delicate negotiations. The three families would rule the region between the [[West Sellen River]] and the Tolemaida River as the [[Triunes of Lambreth]], a three-family oligarchy. The three families came to this union because they feared annexation of their region by the stronger [[River Kingdoms]] in the area, particularly [[Tymon]] and [[Daggermark]].
