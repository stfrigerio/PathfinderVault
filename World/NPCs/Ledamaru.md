> **Queen Ledamaru** was an infamous [[Rune giant|rune giant]] who lived and died over four millennia ago. In [[-450 AR]] the [[Giant|giants]] of the lands south of the [[Grungir Forest]] ([[Cyrusian|Old Cyrusian]]), and the [[Ironbound Archipelago]] ([[Edasseril|Old Edasseril]]) united under her banner. She launched a brutal 4-year assault on the [[Linnorm Kingdoms]] that threw the northern land into chaos in a campaign known as the [[Giantkin War]]. The army of giants advanced and managed to reach and lay siege to [[Kalsgard]]. At that time the [[Ulfen]] Kingdoms decided to fight back. [[Ulvass|King Ulvass]] repelled the giants and drove them back into Old Cyrusian. When the Ulfen reached the capital city of the giants, Queen Ledamaru in desperation used an ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] weapon which destroyed the city of [[Torandey]] along with both armies.
