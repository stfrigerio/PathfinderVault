> **Captain Jess Gildersleeve** was a port-governor of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of [[Roderic's Cove|Roderics Cove]]. In [[4708 AR]], Captain Jess Gildersleeve, port-governor at the time, was caught skimming [[Gold|gold]] from the protection money the town paid to [[Riddleport]] [[Pirate|pirates]]. Shamed and threatened with arrest, Jess fled town with her nine-year-old daughter, Jana. Jess and Jana went to Riddleport and lived under the protection of the same syndicate that had been exploiting Roderic's Cove. A few years later, Jess perished in a unfortunate accident on the docks.
