> **Rassimeri Jaijarko** is one of the most powerful men in the maze-like wreck that makes up the [[Magnimar|Magnimarian]] city district of [[Rag's End|Rags End]]. A slumlord of no small renown, it is reckoned that Jaijarko may own most of the filthy tenements and dirty hovels that make up the city's poorest district. On top of his already despicable treatment of his tenants, Jaijarko is also known as a [[Recreational drugs of Golarion|drug]] dealer. The [[Varisian|half-Varisian]] maintains his stranglehold on the district via his connection with a local [[Sczarni]] gang known as the [[Gallowed]], whom he uses as hired muscle when needed.
> Jaijarko lives in luxury from within his fortified headquarters, the ambitiously named [[Jaijarko Castle]]. He encourages the rumors that he received his wealth and power from [[Devil|devils]] both by the choice of decor and having his female bodyguards dress in uniforms that make them resemble [[Erinyes|erinyes]]. In truth he gained his riches by winning a [[Ship|ship]] from a [[Pirate|pirate]] captain in a game of cards. Once he took possession of the ship, he found a hidden cache filled with gems.
