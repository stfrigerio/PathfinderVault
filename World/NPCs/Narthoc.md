> The high-priest **Narthoc** was a member of the [[Shining Crusade]], the war waged against the forces of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] in the late 38th and early 39th century AR. After the defeat of the [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] in [[38' AR]], it was Narthoc, most blessed of Aroden, crafted the [[Great Seal]] and the lesser seals used to imprison the Whispering Tyrant's spirit under the tower of [[Gallowspire]]. According to the writings of a young squire named Adolfus Drusilliath, Narthoc commanded that the lesser seals be taken out of [[Ustalav]] and hidden in the "world of the living", far from the reach of undead.
