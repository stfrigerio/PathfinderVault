> **Adolphus** was a [[Pathfinder]] who began his career as the assistant of the Pathfinder [[Selmius Foster]]. He published the account of his master's death in Volume 3 of the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]*. Adolphus later married Princess Ganjay, the Opal of [[Bhopan]]; the two absconded with the royal treasury, which they used to found the [[Nexus House|Pathfinder lodge]] in [[Quantium]], [[Nex]]. It is also said that Adolphus established financial assistance of uncertain terms to the [[Wounded Wisp]] tavern in [[Absalom]] after Foster's death.
