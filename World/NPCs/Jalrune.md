> **Grand Prince Jalrune** was [[Grand Prince]] of [[Taldor]] during the 32nd century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]]. He was reportedly assassinated by [[Qadira|Qadiran]] agents in [[3129 AR]].


## Achievements

> The grand prince successfully drove off an [[Ice linnorm|ice linnorm]] that had been terrorizing communities along the [[World's Edge Mountains|Worlds Edge Mountains]]. This triumph occurred, at least in part, due to vital information provided by [[Birgitte Redmane]]. The emperor freed Birgitte from her imprisonment as a reward and the two became close friends.


## Legacy

> The [[Jalrune River]] is named for the Grand Prince, and the [[Memorial Arch of Grand Prince Jalrune]] in [[Oppara|Opparas]] [[Lionsgate district]] was built in his honor and depicts his fabled history. Jalrune's assassination inspired his successor to found the [[Ulfen Guard]] as the Grand Prince's personal bodyguards.
