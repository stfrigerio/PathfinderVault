> **Haty-a Oshep Kahmed** is the governor of [[Wati]], serving at the pleasure of the [[Khemet III|Ruby Prince]] of [[Osirion]]. While he technically leads the Wati City Council, he often only votes to break ties as he finds himself a disinterested outsider on most issues. He does ensure the farms and orchards are run efficiently.
