> **Duchess Veleto Lotheed** was a brilliant woman who served in her youth as a spy and infiltrator and then, in her later life, as a formidable presence on the [[Oppara|Opparan]] social scene. Veleto Lotheed was married to the immortal [[Magic/Conjuration|conjurer]] [[Panivar Lotheed|Duke Panivar Lotheed]] and, thanks to her well-renowned wit, guile, and ruthlessness, she was one of the few people Panivar considered his equal. His quest for [[Immortal|immortality]] unfortunately granted no reprieve for Veleto from death's cold embrace. Having spent a life researching immortality, Panivar thought himself beyond petty [[Mortal|mortal]] feelings but the death of his wife devastated him.
> After Veleto's death, Panivar tried desperately to resurrect her, despite knowing the futility of doing this with someone who died of old age. When this inevitably failed, he turned to stranger, more [[Arcane|arcane]] methods. Panivar experimented with crafting a new [[Soul|soul]] from a combination of planar dust and the memories of those who loved her most. In the end he succeeded, in a manner of speaking, in creating a [[Trompe l'oeil|trompe loeil]], a living painting. It is ultimately a sterile facsimile of his real wife. While the so-called 'Duchess Veleto Lotheed' retains her skill with a blade and her cunning, she is fundamentally lacking the spark of the original. Still, the new duchess is a capable guardian of the Lotheed family mansion, the [[Palace of Birdsong]].
