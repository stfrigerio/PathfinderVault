## Background as a Pathfinder

> Scepter was a celebrated [[Pathfinder]], the protege of the famed Pathfinder Kal Tarrow. Scepter's best known work includes [[Pathfinder ChroniclesVolume 56|Volume 56]] of the [[Pathfinder Chronicles]] in which he contributed maps and accounts of the [[Gozarin Necropolis]] in central [[Osirion]].
> Scepter, however, later abandoned the [[Pathfinder Society]] in favor of the life as a freelance [[Evoker|evoker]] assassin, pilfering several Pathfinder trade secrets and killing a number of former companions during his sudden exit. Some speculate he is responsible for the death of [[Kaldis Blacksquall]], who was found dead the morning after Scepter left; since then, he has employed [[Magic|magic]] to change his physical appearance, assuming a new identity to evade retribution.
