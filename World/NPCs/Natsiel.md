> **Natsiel** is a [[Half-fiend|half]]-[[Succubus|succubus]] minion of [[Mestama]] who delights in spreading pain and misery, particularly in [[Kintargo]].


## Relatives

> In 4785 AR, Natsiel came to Kintargo to seduce Hetawell Haace, who fell into despair when she abandoned him. A week later, she returned, revealing to him that she was a half-succubus and that she had [[Magic|magically]] quickened the gestation of their son. Natsiel left the baby [[Hetamon Haace|Hetamon]] for Hetawell to raise, believing that the scandal of having a [[Tiefling|tiefling]] child would be too much and he would eventually fall into sin and then to the [[Abyss]] upon death, followed by his traumatised son.


## Background

> When her son was ten years old, Natsiel returned to Kintargo, and was infuriated when he and his father were having a happy life together. She crippled Hetawell by almost completely draining his life force, knowing that he could not afford the medical bill.
> In [[4715 AR]], when [[Barzillai Thrune]] became Kintargo's mayor, Natsiel came there again with a [[Green hag|green hag]] coven and [[Magic/Enchantment|charmed]] [[Strea Vestori]]. With Strea's aid and advice, Natsiel moved into the ruins below the [[Silver Star]], delighted at the idea of corrupting a [[Sarenrae|Sarenite]] shrine. In the following days, she kept a close eye on Hetamon, eventually managing to capture him and feeding on his life. Before she could turn him over to Barzillai in return for money or hunting rights in Kintargo, he was rescued by a band of [[Adventurer|adventurers]].
