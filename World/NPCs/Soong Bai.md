> **Soong Bai** was a famous eccentric hermit who is best remembered as a gifted [[Acupuncturist|acupuncturist]] and for inadvertently introducing this [[Medicine|medicinal]] art to the [[Yixing]] Empire. In [[2802 AR]], Soong saved a Yixing explorer from a dire injury inflicted by a [[Diseases of Golarion|diseased]] [[Boar|boar]] using acupuncture. When word of this new, miraculous healing method reached the imperial court, a new province, [[Chu Ye]], was established in the area.


## Legacy

> Followers of Soong Bai most likely invented *[[Dianxue gloves|dianxue gloves]]*, which primarily help their wearer to heal in various ways. However, the gloves are also [[Magic|magically]] infused to help the wearer in unarmed combat.
