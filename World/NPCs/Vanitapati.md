> **Vanitapati** was an incredibly potent [[Vudra|Vudran]] [[Psychic|psychic]] who is most famous for defeating the [[Spawn of Rovagug]] known as [[Kothogaz|Kothogaz the Dance of Disharmony]]. Vanitapati finally defeated Kothogaz in [[345 AR]], after the various [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapadas]] of the Impossible Kingdoms had united to fight the abominable spawn but to no avail: Kothogaz destroyed one kingdom after another, all but unstoppable. To defeat the colossal abomination, Vanitapati channelled the [[Psychic magic|psychic energy]] of yogis, psychics, [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]], and even uncountable common people. With their combined psychic might, Vanitapati was able to manifest a mental avatar as tall as a mountain that was able to tear Kothogaz into 101 chunks of rancid flesh. The strain of this manifestation was enormous, costing over a million Vudrani lives and completely stripping Vanitapati of all her psychic abilities. Today, the site of this battle is memorialised by [[Devi|The Devi]], a colossal statue over two hundred feet tall that serves as both a site of holy pilgrimage and a powerful nexus for [[Psychic magic|psychic magic]].
