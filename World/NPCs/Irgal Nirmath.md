> **Irgal Nirmath** was a trapper living in the [[Fangwood 1]] in what was then the northern reaches of [[Molthune]]. Unhappy with the centralized control exerted by the southern capital of [[Canorate]], he joined the side of the rebels in the [[Freedom War]]. He became a commander and was able to organized the disparate forces, including the [[Chernasardo Rangers]], into a single, sizable army. Thanks to his leadership, the rebels were able to start winning victories and his legend spread. They renamed themselves [[Irgal's Axe|Irgals Axe]] and through cunning and guerrilla tactics were able to force the Molthuni forces to surrender and allow them to succeed.  On the very night of their victory, however, Irgal was slain by an assassin. In his honor, the fledgling nation took the name [[Nirmathas]].
