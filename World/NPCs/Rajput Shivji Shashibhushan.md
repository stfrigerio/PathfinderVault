> The **Vile Prince Rajput Shivji Shashibhushan** was a powerful [[Necromancy|necromancer]] who built his lair on the sacred ground of the [[Divine Garden]] region in eastern [[Vudra]]. In [[4465 AR]], the Vile Prince began creating his fortress, the [[Palace of Ivory and Bone]], using [[Elephant|elephant]] bones and ivory pillaged from the holy elephant graveyard of the [[Ajitesh Valley]]. Rajput also used the plundered remains to create [[Rajput ambari|rajput ambari]], strong [[Undead|undead]] labourers that helped him to build his unholy fortress. The Vile Prince Rajput Shivji Shashibhushan was defeated centuries ago but it is rumoured that in some form he still haunts the Palace of Ivory and Bone to this day.
