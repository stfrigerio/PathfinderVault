> **Master and Commander Claidius Barronmor** was the head of the [[Knights of Ozem]] toward the end of the 39th century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]]. In [[3889 AR]], in an effort to reclaim the glory of his knightly order, which had fallen since the days of the [[Shining Crusade]] 60 years earlier, he ordered seven knights to infiltrate the [[Geb's Rest|Gebbite]] capital of [[Mechitar]], in preparation for an eventual full-scale invasion of Geb. All of the knights, including his own grandson [[Amaretos Manslayer|Amaretos]], were killed in Mechitar, and animated as [[Graveknight|graveknights]] by the country's ghostly ruler, [[Geb (person)|Geb]]. Claidius' invasion ended up to be an utter failure, as the crusaders who made it to Geb were killed, and the others were forced to retreat. He later died in disgrace.
