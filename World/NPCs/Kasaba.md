> **Admiral Kasaba** is [[Taldor]]'s first female admiral, and is in charge of the entire [[Taldan Imperial Navy]]. Her career is impressive given that she started as a miserable galley [[Slavery|slave]] on a [[Zimar Corsairs|Zimar corsair]] [[Ship|ship]] in the [[Obari Ocean]]. She is [[Qadira|half-Qadiran]], but she gets angry if this is referenced. Kasaba is a fierce, strong woman, and the people of Cassomir admire her indomitable spirit.
