> **Asilia of Gyr** is the current commander of [[Starwatch Keep]], and therefore of the [[Starwatch]], the military unit charged in keeping order within the city of [[Absalom]]. Originally from the [[Fangwood 1]], she served beside [[Gyr of House Gixx|Lord Gyr of Gixx]] before he became [[Primarch]]. A true lover of all things nautical, Asilia spends most of her time on her warship, the *[[Hurricane Wings]]*, rather than in Starwatch Keep. She is fiercely loyal to the Primarch and is one of the cornerstones of his grip on power within this fractious city.
