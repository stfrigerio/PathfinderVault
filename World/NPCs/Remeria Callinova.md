> **Remeria Callinova** is the current head of the [[Varisian Council]], the [[Magnimar|Magnimarian]] government body tasked with protecting the rights of the city's indigenous [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisian]] population. An elderly woman, she has recently become more concerned about the plight of Magnimar's small [[Shoanti]] population, who have no official representation within the city's government. The task of getting the city's Shoanti greater respect and recognition has been an uphill battle, as many of them are exiles and malcontents, who left [[Varisia|Varisias]] established [[ShoantiTribes of the Shoanti|tribes]] under difficult circumstances.
