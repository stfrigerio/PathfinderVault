> **Hregana Marchelin** is the latest queen of [[Orynox Marchelin]], the ruler of the [[Fire giant|fire giant]] realm of [[Kragnaroth]] in the [[Mindspin Mountains]], east of [[Varisia]]. The great warrior Hregana traveled from distant lands to the south to seek Orynox's hand in marriage. The fierce and ruthless King Orynox has already killed no fewer than five of his own wives but he seems to be especially preoccupied by Hregana.
