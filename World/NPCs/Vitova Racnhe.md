> **Vitova Racnhe** is the self-proclaimed [[Hellknight ranks|Lictor]] of the [[Order of the Coil]], a vile [[Hellknights]] order that seeks to erase all traces of the native [[Mwangi]] peoples of [[Sargava]] from the face of [[Golarion]]. Secretly, Lictor Racnhe has a close emotional investment in these atrocities, as she blames the Mwangi for her sister's death at [[New Krane]].
