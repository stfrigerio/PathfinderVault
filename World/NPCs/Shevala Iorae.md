> **Shevala Iorae** is a [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisian]] [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] in the [[Pathfinder Society]] who lives and works in the Society's [[Grand Lodge]] in [[Absalom]]. She helped found the [[Pathfinder lodge|lodge]] in her native [[Magnimar]] in [[4706 AR]] and often travels there to visit. She is known for her stern demeanor and association with less-than-scrupulous mercenaries and vagabonds, the most famous of these being the renegade [[Pathfinder]] [[Eando Kline]]. 
> Although she began her studies in [[Varisia]] exploring the ancient ruins of fallen [[Thassilon]], she made her name within the Society by studying the many siege towers that litter the [[Cairnlands]] outside the wall of her adopted home. The [[Spire of Nex]], an immense siege tower located 10 miles to the north of the walls of Absalom, became her particular focus of interest. She studied it for many years, and in [[4703 AR]] was the first person to discover how to unlock it in over 1,000 years. To do this, Shevala employed a team of [[Mathematics|mathematicians]] to crack a complex cipher keyed to the Spire's "unopenable" door. Shevala's exploits was published in volume 36 of the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]*.
> Shevala also explored and mapped the two top levels of the dungeons of [[Red Redoubt of Karamoss]].
