> Yrax is an extremely old [[Dragon|dragon]], having lived for more than 700 years and through two of Triaxus's century-long winters. He managed to retain control of his fortress of Ivoryglass even as his power faded during Triaxus's long summers, and with the onset of his third winter amassed a large army of [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]] to invade the Skyfire Mandate. The focus of his assault was the fortress of Spurhorn in the Parapet Mountains, against which he has sent an army of [[Triaxian]] warriors and [[Frost drake|frost drakes]] overseen by the silver [[Dragonkin|dragonkin]] General Malesinder.
