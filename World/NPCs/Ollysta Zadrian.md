> **Ollysta Zadrian** began her career as a [[Pathfinder]] hoping to spread the faith of [[Sarenrae]] throughout the world as she adventured, but soon became disillusioned when she found the [[Pathfinder Society]] too restrictive. After retiring from the society, she began the [[Silver Crusade]], which operates out of the [[Temple of the Shining Star]] in [[Absalom|Absaloms]] [[Ascendant Court]], an organization of followers of[[Good|good]]]-aligned [[Deity|deities]] who hope to use the Pathfinder Society's resources to do good in the world.
> She died in [[4719 AR]] while protecting fellow Pathfinders in the [[Siege of Gallowspire]].
