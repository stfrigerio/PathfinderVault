> **Kosiavitch Criath** was a charismatic [[Iobarian human ethnicity|Iobarian]] [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]] who lived in the [[Iobaria|Iobarian]] city of [[Daruthrost]]. When Daruthrost was struck by [[Diseases of Golarion|plague]], Criath gathered a number of followers to butcher victims of the disease in an attempt to prevent its spread. When the plague victims barricaded themselves in the upper levels of the great bridge of Daruthrost, his followers carved isolated living quarters for themselves within the bridge's span itself. It is unknown what happened to Criath afterwards, but plague struck his followers a decade later, and despite their brutal attempts to prevent its spread, there were no recorded survivors of Daruthrost.
