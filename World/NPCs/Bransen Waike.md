## History

> Bransen Waike was elevated to this position in [[4690 AR]] by [[Sovella Artume|Queen Sovella Artume]].  A veteran of the [[Mendev|Mendevian]] Crusades, he was entrusted with this position until the Queen could give birth to her son Edryd. Turning his back on his oath as a [[Paladin|paladin]], Waike unsuccessfully tried to have Sovella assassinated, blamed the attempt on the nearby city of [[Daggermark]], and started ruling Artume like a thuggish kleptocracy.
