> **Echataxun** is a [[Nalfeshnee|nalfeshnee]] sent by [[Treerazer]] to destroy the [[Calistria|Calistrian]] temple of [[Imvrildara]]. The nalfeshnee was perpetually sealed in stone after being defeated in single combat by [[Alendeil]], a priest of Calistria, at some point after [[2497 AR]]. Echataxun's petrification was deemed to be a Calistrian miracle. The petrified form of Echataxun is now held in the Stone Library of the temple, and used to provide information to the Calistrians via the *harvest knowledge* [[Spell|spell]].
