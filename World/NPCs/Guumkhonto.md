> **Guumkhonto the Plaguespear** is the [[Eloko]] high priest of the [[Carrionwalkers|Carrionwalker tribe]] in the town of [[Elokolobha]], on the eastern border of the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. His tribe was exiled long ago from the upper spires of the town and forced to live in the carrion-filled crevasses below. The Carrionwalkers learned to survive and have since thrived in their horrid territory.
