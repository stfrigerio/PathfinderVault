> The [[Scrag|scrags]] of the [[Scrag Deep tribe]] are still led by descendants of their ancient warlord [[Tirchagac]]. Each of the tribe's warlords takes on the "war-name" of its ancestor. The current **Tirchagac** is a particularly loathsome brute and [[Helkgen]] townsfolk have paid the scrags enormous tribute in order to avoid bloody raids. Challengers to Tirchagac's authority who have been shown up in the tribe are Mhraggat and the "Mother of Carnage" Piyakak getting a growing number of supporters among the young members of the tribe.
