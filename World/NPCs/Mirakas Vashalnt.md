> **Mirakas Vashalnt** is a mysterious figure in the social circles of [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]] due to her role running the equally mysterious [[Bureau of Special Affairs]] from the [[Whiteshaw]] building. Though Mirakas and the Bureau of Special Affairs share the building with the [[Department of Constables and Investigators]] (who serve as Caliphas's police force), no one is sure what exactly she and her bureau do or are responsible for, apart from [[Aduard Ordranti III|Prince Aduard Ordranti]] and his adviser, [[Diauden]].
