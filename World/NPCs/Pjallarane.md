>  **Pjallarane** is a daughter of [[Baba Yaga]]. She was the fourth Queen of [[Irrisen]]. She reigned from [[3613 AR]] until [[3713 AR]], when she was apparently removed from [[Golarion]]. Her sister [[Aelena]] replaced her as Queen.
>  Pjallarane and her children resisted being deposed by Baba Yaga, but their rebellion was ruthlessly crushed in a single day of terror. This is commemorated in Irrisen each year on 1 Abadius (New Year's Day) in a holiday known as [[Pjallarane Day]].
>  Pjallarane is associated with [[Pjallarane's Stone]], a strange rock formation in [[Thronehold]] province. According to legend, Pjallarane fled Baba Yaga's wrath, only to be overtaken by her vengeful mother and turned to stone. This conflicts with the accepted history that Pjallarane departed Golarion with her mother, like all the other ex-Queens of Irrisen.
