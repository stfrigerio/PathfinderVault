> **Taldaris** founded the [[Principalities of Taldaris]], the seed of what is now known as [[Taldor]], by uniting the local city-states along the eastern coast of the [[Inner Sea]] between [[-1293 AR]] and [[-1281 AR]]. He was subsequently crowned Taldor's first emperor (or [[Grand Prince]] as they are officially named) and ruled until his death on 31 [[Kuthona]], [[-1144 AR]]. His [[Soul|soul]] lived on after judgment in [[Axis]] for over 1,000 years before his ultimate transformation into an [[Impariut|impariut]] [[Inevitable|inevitable]].



## Background


### Mythic childhood

> Taldan mythology tells of an infant Taldaris raised by wild [[Lion|lions]] on the [[Tandak Plains]], where even as a youth he is said to have performed extraordinary tasks, such as beheading a threatening [[Cockatrice|cockatrice]] with his bare hands. He was adopted by [[Oppara|Opparan]] soldiers, who taught Taldaris discipline, oratory, and skill at arms from these warriors, and he eventually rose to the rank of captain.
> His rapid rise won the praise of the childless grand prince of Oppara, who named Taldaris his heir upon his death. Some Taldan histories of Taldaris link his imperial coronation to his crowning as grand prince of Oppara, and cite the date as 13 [[Rova]], [[-1295 AR]].


### Founding of Taldor

> Using his tactical prowess, superior forces, and uncanny luck, Taldaris led his troops in a 12-year-long war of conquest beginning in [[-1293 AR]] that transformed his title in Oppara to a fledgling unified nation of city-states. He first attacked the larger cities along the Inner Sea coast that posed the greatest threat. Once he had secured their allegiance and resources, he turned his attention on the more distant settlements of the area. He then declared his new nation as the Principalities of Taldaris, ruling over an area that stretched along the coast from the southern [[Verduran Forest]] to the [[Jalrune River]]. During this period, Taldaris is also said to have faced and slain the [[Grogrisant|grogrisant]], a lion-like beast that had terrorized the city-states for centuries.
> The Principalities of Taldaris became [[Taldor]] in [[-1281 AR]], with Taldaris crowned as emperor.


### Reign and death

> During his exceptionally long reign (-1295 to [[-1144 AR]]), the people under Taldaris' rule saw themselves as an empire united against the barbarism of the rest of the world. Taldan myths claim that his long life was unaided by the *[[Sun orchid elixir|sun orchid elixir]]*, and that he died after personally defeating Verksaris the Kingeater, a [[Dragon|dragon]] that menaced [[Golsifar]]. The dragon's [[Venom|venom]] purportedly killed him three days after their battle, though not before Taldaris extracted [[Gold|gold]] from the dragon's gullet that legend holds was used to forge the *[[Primogen Crown]]*.


### Afterlife and transformation

> After his death, Taldaris was sent by [[Pharasma]] to [[Axis]]. As a [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioner]], he regularly communicated with his successors for advice and blessings while making himself at home in Axis and getting elected as part of the ruling council of the district of [[Sayashto]]. However, he had difficulty leaving his mortal life behind until [[Aroden]]'s ascension, after which the Taldans started to forget him; this freed his attentions and allowed him to solve the riddles inscribed on his petitioner body to earn entrance to the [[Adamantine Crucible]] and fully transform into an [[Impariut|impariut]] [[Inevitable|inevitable]].
> As an impariut, Taldaris regularly visits the [[Material Plane]] to nurture kingdoms, mentor monarchs, and execute tyrants. He has gradually given away his mementos of Taldor's earliest years in confidence that his legacy will live on.
