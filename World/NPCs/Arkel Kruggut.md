> **Arkel Kruggut** (also known as **Arvelle Kruggut**), is the middle-aged [[Kellid]] bartender of the seedy [[Fallen from Grace]] tavern in the small port town of [[Blackblood Cay]] on [[Shark Island]] in the [[Shackles]]. She is an utterly humorless person with a wicked scar that runs along her brow. She never speaks about her homeland, but foreign Kellid warriors, who wear cloaks marked with the blood-red symbol of a three-fingered hand-print, visit Arkel every few months.
