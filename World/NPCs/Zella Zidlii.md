> **Zella Zidlii** is a ruthlessly [[Evil|evil]], [[Varisian]] follower of [[Asmodeus]] who has wound up working as a redactor for the [[Temple of Asmodeus Kintargo|Temple of Asmodeus]] in [[Kintargo]]. Whilst she works for the temple, Zella is no priest, she is a [[Harrower]] who became obsessed with [[Asmodeus]] and [[Hell]] when she was studying at the [[Acadamae]] in distant [[Korvosa]]. She was so obsessed that she sold her siblings to a [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelaxian]] slaver in exchange for passage to [[Cheliax]] and a letter of recommendation to [[House Thrune]]. She has now served the Church of Asmodeus by providing [[Arcane|arcane]] [[Spell|spellcasting]] and, though she is not a [[Cleric|cleric]], she is every bit as devout as any member of the priesthood.
