> **Damian Blakros** (*né* **Kastner**) was a [[Hellknight ranks|maralictor]] of the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Scourge]]. Despite accounts that he acts in deference to the wishes of [[Cheliax|Chelish]] diplomat [[Zarta Dralneen]], the paracountess pulled political strings within the [[Pathfinder Society]] to obtain an invitation for Kastner to attend the [[Grand Convocation]] in [[Absalom]] in [[4712 AR]].
> After a brief courtship, he was wedded to [[Michellia Blakros]] at [[Pariol Island]] in 4712 AR and assumed [[Blakros family|her family name]], giving up his status among the Hellknights in the process. As part of his matrimonial obligations, he controversially offered his family's manor of Ostergarde as his dowry.
