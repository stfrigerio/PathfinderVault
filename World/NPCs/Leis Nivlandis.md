> **Master Leis Nivlandis** is the master of [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] most prestigious school for [[Wizard|wizards]], the [[Stone of the Seers]], a position which brings him much personal prestige. Not only is Leis Nivlandis the current master, but he was also its founder. Leis met the water spirit that inhabited the [[Seerspring Gardens]], and after its disappearance, decided to found a school that specialised in [[Magic/Divination|divination]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Magic/Abjuration|abjuration]] magics.
