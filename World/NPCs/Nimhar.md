> **Nimhar** was a mysterious woman, in [[Katapesh]] who walked out of the desert in [[2689 AR]] and began clearing the ruins of the [[Golden City]]. Others join her in her task. In [[2692 AR]] Nimhar took control of the new Golden City and renamed it to [[Sandstar]]. People flocked to the new city. A bandit named Jade-Eye slaughtered Nimhar in [[3250 AR]] and took control of the city. Nimhar's body is never found. Jade-Eye renamed the city [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]].
