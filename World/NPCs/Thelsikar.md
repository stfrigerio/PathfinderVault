> **Thelsikar** is a follower of [[Lamashtu]]. He received divine guidance about the adventurers from [[Sandpoint]] who disrupted his goddess's plans. Recently he has been seen with the [[Dragon|dragon]] [[Black Fang]] east of Sandpoint in the [[Ravenroost]] hills near an old tower called [[Raven's Watch|Ravens Watch]].


## Appearance

> Thelsikar obscures his humanity behind a long, black, hooded robe and a skull-shaped *mortuary mask*. He wields a *bonespur dagger* seemingly made from sharpened, [[Humanoid|humanoid]] arm bones.


## Philosophy

> Thelsikar is extremely loyal to his [[Demon|demonic]] mistress Lamashtu who has 'blessed' him with nightmares and visions for some while. Recently, however, one vision sparked in him a particular passion for power: his vision of draconic fury. Thelsikar is now under the impression that, through him, Lamashtu will gain power as he releases a plague of demonic [[Dragon|dragons]] into [[Golarion]]. His association with Black Fang is the beginning of the outworking of this plan.
