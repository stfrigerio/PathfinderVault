> **Ingimundr the Unruly** is the old-fashioned and argumentative ruler of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Broken Bay]]. He resides in the capital city of [[Bildt]] on the island of [[Aegos]], and openly criticizes other [[Ulfen]] for having given up raiding. Many independent [[Ship|ships]] captains and second sons still conduct raids out of Bildt, to which Ingimundr turns a blind eye after he takes a share of their spoils. Ingimundr has to walk a fine line between encouraging the old [[Ulfen]] ways of reaving and distancing himself from those who have choosen to raid the other Linnorm Kingdoms. Ingimundr and his kingdom's prestige continues to rise as more and more Ulfen across the Lands of the Linnorm Kings adopt the way of the seafaring raider.
