*For another meaning of "Kavapesta", please see [[Kavapesta]].*
> **Mother Kavapesta**, called **Sister Sorrow**, was a priestess of [[Pharasma]] in [[Ustalav]]. Known for her stoicism and sombre style of worship, she introduced a ceremonial style of worship known as [[Pharasmin Penitence]] in [[3833 AR]] that is still practised to this day.
> After her death in [[3879 AR]] her followers renamed [[Lake Divirmis]] to [[Lake Kavapesta]] in her honour and also founded the settlement of [[Kavapesta]]. The city has since become the center of the faith.
