> The caretaker of the [[Sandpoint Boneyard]], **Naffer Vosk**, is a deformed smuggler with a twisted spine and lurching gait who was taken in by [[Ezakien Tobyn]] after his ship wrecked north of the town in [[4697 AR]]. While tending the cemetery, Vosk found redemption from his roguish ways through the faith of [[Sarenrae]] and he is now one of the town's most pious citizens. In addition to keeping the grounds in pristine condition, Naffer also rings the cathedral's bell daily at dawn, noon, and dusk.
