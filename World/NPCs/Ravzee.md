> **Ravzee** serves as the boss of the [[Kintargo]] thieves' band known as the [[River Talons]]. Ravzee is a [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]] and therefore normally something of a rarity in Kintargo but the rest of his thieves' crew is made up entirely of tengus. The River Talons have never made the final leap to full on thieves' guild, instead remaining a mere band of trouble making thugs. Ravzee has a turbulent relationship with his brother [[Chuko]] who runs the [[War Cage]] down in [[Yolubilis Harbor]], since Chuko is renowned for his hatred of thieves, quite possibly as a result of his brother's choice of career.
