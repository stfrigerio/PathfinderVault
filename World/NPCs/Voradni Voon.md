> **Voradni Voon** was a [[Minotaur|minotaur]] warlord from [[Casmaron]]. His desire for [[Ascension|ascension]] and the *[[Starstone]]* drove him to lay the [[First Siege of Absalom|first historical siege]] on [[Absalom]] in [[23 AR]] using an army of [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]], [[Harpy|harpies]], and minotaurs, which he brought through a [[Teleportation|teleportation gate]] known as the [[Brazen Arch]] from [[Iblydos]]. He was repelled by the volunteer guards of Absalom (the progenitors of the [[First Guard]]) who were led by the [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]] himself. Aroden pushed back the besieging army to the eastern plateau on the [[Isle of Kortos]], where he convulsed it with a series of earthquakes that also destroyed the Brazen Arch and scattered Voon's forces.


## Legacy

> His defeat is still celebrated in Absalom in the annual event known as the Passion of the First Siege of Absalom.
