> **Gharen Muricar** is one of the four members of the [[Ravengro Council]], the ruling body of the town of [[Ravengro]] in the [[Canterwall]] county of the nation of [[Ustalav]]. An old man now, Gharen is popular in the town as the author of the *[[Wealday Parchment]]*, the closest thing the town has to a weekly newspaper published on the town's five [[Posting Poles]]. His interest in the news has further found a use as Gharen acts as the council's eyes and ears on the world outside Ravengro; he also acts as an amateur town historian. He is great friends with his fellow councilman [[Vashian Hearthmount]] and is known to have quite an eye for the ladies despite his growing age. He lives in a house on the north-west outskirts of the town.
