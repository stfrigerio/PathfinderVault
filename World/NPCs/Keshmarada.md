> **Keshmarada** leads the Scions of Revenge within the [[Imvrildarai]], an ancient order of militaristic [[Calistria|Calistrian]] priests in the southern [[Fierani Forest]] of [[Kyonin]].


## Background

> Keshmarada was an operative of the secretive *[[Shin'Rakorath|ShinRakorath]]* who fought [[Treerazer|Treerazers]] [[Demon|demons]] deep behind the [[Tanglebriar]]. Some time around [[4616 AR]], she became trapped in the [[Abyss]] for decades before finding her way back to the [[Material Plane]].
> Upon her return, she was rejected and hunted by the Shin'Rakorath as an abomination. She escaped and wandered Kyonin in exile for years before finding sanctuary in [[Imvrildara]]. While she found a compatible [[Philosophy|philosophy]] in Calistria's vengeful portfolio, she retained her rage against both the Shin'Rakorath and Treerazer, and attempts to manipulate the Imvrildarai into turning on Kyonin's regime by accusing it of being complicit in Treerazer's calamity.
> She succeeded the order's current [[Delerenai Ashwalker|High Priestess Delerenai Ashwalker]], the former head of the Scions of Deceit, in [[4714 AR]] after the previous [[Rekaereil Sandurei|High Priest Rekaereil Sandurei]] was assassinated by [[Cambion|cambions]].
