> **Bodriggan Wuthers** was a [[Taldor|Taldan]] [[Pathfinder]] who became a [[Zyphus zombie]] after being killed by the [[Zyphus|gods]] followers in [[Oppara]].


## Background

> Bodriggan Wuthers was an orphan dropped off at the door of the [[Pathfinder Lodge]] in the Taldan capital of Oppara. Although the Pathfinders took him to an orphanage, they kept a close eye on him throughout his childhood, encouraging his curiosity and love of exploration. Upon reaching his sixteenth birthday, Bodriggan left Oppara and traveled to [[Absalom]] to join the [[Pathfinder Society]]. There he trained for a number of years and after graduation became the assistant to [[Venture-Captain]] [[Eliza Petulengro]]. The two traveled throughout [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]]. By the time he was 18, he had recovered the *[[Garls Harp]]*, an ancient [[Azlant|Azlanti]] [[Artifact|artifact]], from the [[Screaming Jungle]], and cemented his history in the Society by being published in the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]*.
> Around [[4707 AR]], Wuthers came to the attention of [[Fel Bustrani]], a [[Cleric|cleric]] of Zyphus. Masquerading as a priest of [[Irori]], Bustrani told Wuthers of a hidden Azlanti artifact known as the *[[Zyphus Stone]]* buried beneath the [[House of the Immortal Son]], Oppara's famous [[Opera|opera house]]. Working together, the two gained access to the building and began digging beneath it to recover the *Zyphus Stone*. Upon reaching the [[Chamber of the Stone]] where the Azlanti had buried the artifact, Bustrani killed Wuthers and let the artifact transform his corpse into a [[Zyphus zombie]]. His [[Undead|undead]] remains were destroyed soon thereafter during the [[Zombie|zombie]] outbreak at the opera house that was contained by his fellow Pathfinders.
