> **Saebjorn Arm-Fang** was the founding [[Linnorm King]] of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], ruling the land between [[-624 AR]] and [[-608 AR]].


## Background

> Saebjorn defeated a [[Crag linnorm|crag linnorm]] in single combat in -624 AR at the mouth of the [[Rimeflow River]], and used the heroic nature of the act to declare himself ruler of the land. He also decreed that anyone who would rule the cold land in far-northwestern [[Avistan]] also had to kill a [[Linnorm|linnorm]] in single combat. The proclamation eventually became tradition and has been followed ever since. Saebjorn then founded the settlement of [[Kalsgard]] around a [[Mead|mead]] hall he and his warriors had been using. By [[-609 AR]], Saebjorn's realm encompassed all lands north of the Rimeflow, and from [[Broken Bay]] in the west to [[Glacier Lake]] (in what is now [[Irrisen]]) in the east, a territory so large that no Linnorm King has been able to match it since. His son eventually took over the rule of Kalsgard after defeating a linnorm of his own. In -608 AR, Saebjorn sought to expand his kingdom south of the Rimeflow into the [[Giant|giant-occupied]] lands of [[Cyrusian|Old Cyrusian]]. When his attacks against the giants living in the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] ruins failed, he traveled to the [[Grungir Forest]] to defeat the legendary linnorm [[Fafnheir]], hoping that by slaying it he could cow the giants into surrender. Saebjorn never returned from this expedition, however, and his kingdom soon disintegrated into a dozen squabbling fiefdoms.
