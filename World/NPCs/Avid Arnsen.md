> **Lord Avid of House Arnsen** is the current [[Teriarch]], or ruler, of the town of [[Diobel]].  Although he was appointed to the position by the [[Grand Council|Grand Council of Absalom]], he achieved this position through the political machinations of his former childhood friend, [[Lord Gyr]], the Primarch of [[Absalom]]. Lord Gyr thought this sufficient repayment for Avid's many years of faithful support. Sadly, Lord Avid did not feel the same way, and the two are now bitter rivals. This has, by extension, turned the port city of Diobel into a fervent breeding ground for the Primarch's enemies. Since Lord Gyr's disappearance, Arnsen has been plotting to have himself appointed as primarch in his absence.
