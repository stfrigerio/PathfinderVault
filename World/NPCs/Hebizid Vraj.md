> **Vizier Hebizid Vraj** is the chief advisor of [[Xerbystes II]], the [[Satrap|satrap]] of [[Qadira]]. Appointed to his position not by the satrap, but by the [[Padishah Emperor]] himself, Vraj maintains some independence from Xerbystes. The vizier is in charge of overseeing Qadira's external affairs, particularly when it comes to foreign relations, dealing with [[Pirate|pirates]], international trade, and most importantly, war. This last point is of particular importance, as Xerbystes wishes desperately to expand Qadira's borders through conquest, but is impotent to do so, as the nation's generals answer to the emperor in distant [[Kelesh]] as well.
