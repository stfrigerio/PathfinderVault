> **Caroliss Minerran** is the commander of the [[Iomedae|Iomedaean]] [[Knight|knights]] stationed at [[Castle Urion]], in the [[Felldales]] of [[Numeria]], tasked with providing protection to those traveling on the [[Sellen River]]. Under her command, the knights have come into possession of an advanced [[Technological|technological]] device once part of the systems used in the [[Starship|starship]] *[[Divinity]]* to plot and control [[Wormhole|wormhole]] travel. The [[Paladin|paladins]] quickly began studying the device, knowing that its abilities would be invaluable in tracking and detecting both [[Abyss|Abyssal]] rifts and [[Demon|demonic]] [[Teleport|teleporting]].
> However, the [[Technic League]] recently learned of this acquisition and, considering it theft of their technology, has planted spies in the castle to obtain enough information to find the order in breach of Numerian laws and convince the [[Black Sovereign]] to force the paladins to hand over the device. As such, Captain Minerran has been forced to go to extensive lengths to keep the device secret and in the order's possession. However, her actions—intended to preserve the greater good but going against the law—bring her dangerously close to infringing her paladin code.
