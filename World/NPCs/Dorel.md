> **Dorel** is one of the identities taken by a [[Doppelganger|doppelganger]] who holds at least two titles: High Killer (as part of the [[Vernai]], the secret ruling cabal of the [[Red Mantis]]) and **Mayor of Ilizmagorti** (as the ruler of the [[Ilizmagorti|only city]] on [[Mediogalti]]). In his favourite guise as the Mayor of Ilizmagorti, he appears as a bald [[Mwangi]] man, lives on Mayor's Island, and can be visited there by those seeking an audience. He never takes on the same shape twice while having body doubles stand in for other roles, a tactic which has saved his life numerous times. His ability to wander the city in disguise grants him a great deal of knowledge about what goes on.
