> The Mad Poet **Abdul Alhazred** is the author of the *[[Necronomicon]]*, a foul treatise of the [[Outer God|Outer Gods]], [[Great Old One|Great Old Ones]], and their cults.



## Background

> Abdul Alhazred was born more than 1,000 years ago on the [[Planet|planet]] [[Earth]], far from [[Golarion]]. During his exploration of the [[Empty Quarter]] of the [[Arabian Desert]] on Earth, he discovered [[Irem]], also called the City of Pillars, and the [[Nameless City]]. The truths he learned there slowly made him [[Insane|insane]], and drove him to pen the *Kitab Al-Azif* (the original name of the *Necronomicon*). Using his powers, he explored the [[Dreamlands]] where he met [[Nyarlathotep]], who allowed him to perceive the mad [[Deity|god]] [[Azathoth]]. This encounter split his psyche and created a dream duplicate which lives on in the Dreamlands long after the real Alhazred was killed by an invisible creature on the streets of Damascus.
> For more than a millennia, Alhazred's dream duplicate has lived alone in the Dreamlands, unable to leave and resurrecting himself in a barren region of the [[Demiplane|demiplane]] after every death. He spends his time meditating and contemplating secrets, only to destroy them so others cannot know them. Visitors that disturb Alhazred are usually murdered or led astray, except those with unusual knowledge.


## Possessions

> Abdul Alhazred still possesses the original copy of the *Kitab Al-Azif*, which he wrote in Arabic. It serves as his [[Spellbook|spellbook]], vanishes if separated from him, and always manifests with him when he dies and resurrects himself.
