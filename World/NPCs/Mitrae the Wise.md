> **Mitrae the Wise**, along with [[Loyeru Shieldbreaker]], was one of the two founders of the mystic practice now known as the [[Iridian Fold]]. In [[3789 AR]], two men known only as [[World/NPCs/Teacher]] wondered out of the [[Grass Sea]] and into the city of [[Ular Kel]]. Chained together, this pair moved and spoke in perfect unison that revealed a deep connection at some fundamental level. Together, they sought out an audience with the reigning [[Water Lord Ular Kel|Water Lords]] who ruled the city. Despite being completely unarmed, Teacher managed to overcome every guard the Water Lords could throw at them. Eventually a pair of lovers who were also sons of the ruling Water Lords, Mitrae and Loyeru , descended from one of the [[Water Houses]]. They were so impressed by what they saw that they immediately become disciples of Teacher. For a decade until [[3799 AR]], Mitrae and Loyeru studied beneath Teacher, blending their [[Soul|souls]] together and becoming *[[Szerik|szerik]]* until one day Teacher simply walked back into the Grass Sea to never be seen again. Mitrae and Loyeru took over leadership of the Iridian Fold.
