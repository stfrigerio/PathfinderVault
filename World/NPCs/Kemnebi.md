> The [[Vetala|vetala]]/[[Vetalarana|vetalarana]] [[Vampire|vampire]] **Kemnebi** is the Chancellor of the [[Blood Lord|Blood Lords]], the council of [[Necromancer|necromancers]] who handle the practical running of the government of [[Geb's Rest]]. Like all the Blood Lords, he trained at the [[Ebon Mausoleum]] and has sworn eternal loyalty to the ruler of Geb, the ghostly archmage also called [[Geb (person)|Geb]].
> Rumours suggest Kemnebi's enlightened sensibility was stolen from the wisdom of a lowly [[Irori|Iroran]] [[Monk|monk]]. He is known for order, which is seen in his detailed necromantic studies and his iron grip on the Blood Lords.
