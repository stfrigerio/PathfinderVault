> The **Song Pharaoh** was one of the earliest [[Osirion|Osirian]] pharaohs of the [[Age of Destiny]]. She is known to have overthrown her predecessor, the [[Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues]] in [[-3047 AR]] and brought an end to his homeland's alliance with a race of evil and destructive [[Genie|genie]]-kin known as [[Div|div]]. She was killed, and her throne was usurped in [[-2999 AR]] by [[Jetrieti I]].


## History

The Song Pharaoh also founded the city of [[Shiman-Sekh]] that same year, using the [[Golden Oasis Osirion|Golden Oasis]] as its source of water.
