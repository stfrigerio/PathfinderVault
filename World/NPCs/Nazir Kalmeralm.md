> The former "Prince of the Markets", **Nazir Kalmeralm**, used to effectively run the chaotic [[Bazaar of Sails]] district of [[Magnimar]], a feat no one else could manage. His disappearance in [[4685 AR]] thrust his then young daughter [[Sabriyya Kalmeralm|Sabriyya]] into the spotlight.  In the intervening years she has taken on the title of "Princess of the Markets", a role she has excelled in.


## Disappearance

> The truth behind Kalmeralm's disappearance is that he came into possession of a [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] artifact known as the [[Shard of Pride]] in 4685 AR. The item's [[Curses of Golarion|curse]] caused him to become obsessed with tracking down the other parts of the *[[Sihedron]]*, and in the process he discovered an entrance to the Crow, a massive free-standing piling of the [[Irespan]]. Looking for the next shard inside, Kalmeralm was killed by one of the Crow's denizens known as a [[Hungry fog|hungry fog]]. His body lay there undiscovered for almost 30 years, until it was discovered by another group seeking the shard in [[4712 AR]].
