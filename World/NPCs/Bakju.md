> **Bakju** is a [[Wizard|wizard]] of the nation of [[Zi Ha]] who seeks to resolve the conflict between the [[Gutshadmyal|Children of the Hot Hell]] and the [[Gugrangmyal|Children of the Cold Hell]], a conflict he is primarily responsible for. Bakju is a [[Samsaran|samsaran]], and as such has reincarnated many, many times; one of his previous incarnations was obsessed with [[Xulgath|troglodytes]] after finding the ruins of an ancient xulgath civilization that predated the current troglodytes' fall into barbarism. Determined to raise the troglodytes from the intellectual and spiritual abyss into which they had fallen, Bakju decided upon splitting each troglodyte's spiritual essence into two halves; the hot ki persona that embodied their passions and emotion and the cold ki persona that embodied rationality and intellect. Bakju believed that in doing this he would force the troglodytes into resolving the differences between these fundamental aspects of themselves which would force enlightenment and understanding upon the brutish creatures. Bakju's plan backfired spectacularly. Instead of reaching spiritual enlightenment, each troglodyte became dominated by one half of their personality and replaced the missing portion with raw [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] energy. This was many lifetimes ago and the Bakju of today understands the prideful mistake he made. He also understands that he cannot achieve the true enlightenment he desires until he undoes his previous incarnation's mistake.
