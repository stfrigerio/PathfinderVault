> **Elanna Lebeda** is a member of [[Brevoy|Brevoys]] noble [[House Lebeda]], and lives in [[New Stetven]]. She allegedly tried to persuade [[Noleski Surtova|King Noleski Surtova]] to marry her, which made her an enemy of the king's sister, [[Natala Surtova]]. Elanna's mother, [[Sarrona Lebeda|Sarrona]], led the house as regent until her younger brother, [[Lander Lebeda|Lander]], came of age.


## Recent History

> A prospective alliance between [[House Surtova]] and House Lebeda that would have symbolically joined the Brevic regions of Rostland (Elanna) and Issia (King Noleski Surtova) and brought much needed stability to fractured Brevoy, fell apart in [[4718 AR]] when Natala Surtova accused [[Lander Lebeda|Lord Lander Lebeda]] of treason. Lord Lander disappeared soon thereafter, leaving the would-be bride to return home in humiliation. Since Lord Lander had been accused of harboring revolutionary sentiments numerous times during his youth, most of the Brevic nobility believed Natala's accusations. The notable exception were members of [[House Orlovsky]], who claimed that the facts supporting the purported treason were contradictory and unclear, and countered that this was most likely Surtovan propaganda. This has caused a significant fracture between the houses of Surtova and Orlovsky, one that threatens to escalate into armed confrontation.
