> **Lord Geraksis** is a powerful [[Shaitan|shaitan]] who was captured by [[Menedes XX|Pharaoh Menedes XX]] and imprisoned on the [[Prison Barge of Ap-Tula]]. Lord Geraksis had boasted that no prison could hold him because of his friendship with the spirits of the earth. His prison is a floating fortress, hundreds of feet long with thick cedar walls. It has survived more than 3,000 years, by hiding deep in the [[Sphinx Delta]], avoiding conflicts, and never touching land. The prison is guarded by a secretive order that allows no visitors on the barge. Lord Geraksis is still presumed to be on-board and over the millennia the prison barge has been home to other dangerous prisoners too. The prisoners that are currently held within are known only to the barge crew and perhaps to the [[Khemet III|Ruby Prince]].
