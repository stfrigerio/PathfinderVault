> **Queen Boliga Bharsolm** is remembered for leading the three-year [[Battle of Grasyhot]] against the 30 [[Hill giant|hill giant]] tribes of [[Urgo Axbiter]] in [[Numeria]], starting in [[1288 AR]] and ending with the deaths of both Axbiter and Queen Boliga in [[1291 AR]].


## History

> After Urgo Axbiter led the united hill giant tribes from Sarkoris in an invasion of Numeria, Queen Boliga rallied an army of [[Kellid]][[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]]] against them. The three-year conflict that ensued would become known as the Battle of Grasyhot. Axbiter was eventually slain, and his followers buried him in an earthen tomb. Queen Boliga died in the following battles, and to demonstrate their dominance over the region her followers built a larger tomb above Axbiter's.


## Associates

> One of Queen Boliga's rivals was [[Aaramor person|Aaramor]], founder of the [[Blades of Aaramor]]. The warlord eventually became a consort of Queen Boliga, and 14 years after her death, Aaramor established a [[Aaramor|namesake citadel]] northwest of Grasyhot.
