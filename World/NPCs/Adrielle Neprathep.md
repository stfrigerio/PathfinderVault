> **Lady Adrielle Neprathep of House Fyrlenn** is a vital and fiery woman. While she was the chief [[Engineering|engineer]] of the large crane, known as the [[Beast crane|Beast]], she drove her crew like the perfect machine she insisted the Beast remained. She guaranteed the safety of every cargo while it was in the Beast's winch. Adrielle saw herself as a baroness of the docks.
