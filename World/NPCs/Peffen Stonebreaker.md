> [[Dwarf]] **Peffen Stonebreaker** was the previous owner of the [[Drowned Dwarf]], a famous tavern in [[Drenchport]] on the island of [[Tempest Cay]] in the [[Shackles]]. He sold the tavern in [[4710 AR]] to his young cousins [[Dagrun Lelkhammer|Dagrun]] and [[Narrika Lelkhammer]]. It is said that the price for the tavern, plus the recipe for its famous black kelp [[Drowned Dwarf's beer|beer]], was comprised of many full chests of bounty.
