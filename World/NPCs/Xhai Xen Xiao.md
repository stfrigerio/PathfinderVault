> **Xhai Xen Xiao** was a peerless architect, most renowned for founding the city of [[Goka]] in [[313 AR]]. Xhai was known to be a devout follower of [[Abadar]] but clashed with his superiors within the [[Yixing]] empire, resulting in self-imposed exile. After escaping Yixing, he founded the city of Goka, the so called "City of Wonders", in the only geographic gap in the [[Wall of Heaven]] mountain range.
> It is known that many of those Xhai Xen Xiao left behind in Yixing did not wish him well. The advisors of [[Yin|Empress Yin]] wanted him arrested for having the audacity to build the City of Wonders beyond Yixing's borders. In [[326 AR]], the empress visited Goka and, luckily for Xhai, fell in love with the city, thus sparing him from imprisonment. Unfortunately, a mere three years later in [[329 AR]], Xhai fell to his death from one of the towers of the recently built [[Seven Dragon Bridge]]. Rumour had it yellow-clad killers, possibly the Yixing precursors of the modern [[Butterfly Blades]], were responsible for Xhai's fall, although this was never proven.
