> **Seldinin Choaz** was one of the five co-founders of the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Godclaw]].


## Background

> Seldinin Choaz was formerly a [[Paladin|paladin]] of [[Aroden]] and member of the [[Order of the Pyre]]. In [[4622 AR]], twenty years after his [[Deity|gods]] death, Choaz asked for permission to join the first [[Mendevian Crusades|Mendevian Crusade]] launched by the church of Aroden. His superiors allowed only Choaz to go, but he was authorised to recruit allies.
> For nearly 20 years, Choaz fought the [[Demon|demons]] infesting the ruins of [[Sarkoris]]. He gathered a motley band of companions: Miron Vagaul, a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] follower of [[Torag]]; Cilquen Odalevvi, an [[Irori|Iroran]] scholar; Addis Bavosso, an [[Abadar|Abadaran]] priest from [[Brevoy]]; Tevtavallis, an [[Asmodeus|Asmodean]] [[Cleric|cleric]]; and Renrallie Dinyar-Stareye, a Sarkorian [[Summoner|god caller]] and his future wife. Under Choaz's leadership, they adopted the Hellknight discipline and engaged in frequent interfaith dialogues. Choaz converted to the faith of [[Iomedae]], and, following the polytheistic Sarkorian tradition, Renrallie adopted all deities worshipped by the group into her faith. This was the beginning of the Order of the Godclaw.
> In [[4637 AR]], several years after his wife disappeared, Choaz came back to Cheliax with the nascent Order of the Godclaw. In [[4639 AR]], as the Hellknights stripped the titles of many Hellknights endorsed by the Chelish monarchy but lacking ties to existing orders, the Order of the Godclaw managed to convince the Hellknights' leadership of their devotion through reports of their victories against the demons in the [[Worldwound]], and was allowed to build its headquarters of [[Citadel Dinyar]].


## Relatives

> One of Choaz and Renrallie's living descendants is [[Regan Vashan]], who currently holds the rank of [[Hellknight ranks|armiger]] in the Order of the Godclaw.
