> **Mera Bantikere** serves as one the [[Kings and Queens of Vyre|Queens of Vyre]], the rulers of the [[Vyre|City of Masks]] who hide their identities carefully from their subjects. As Queen of Blades, Mera is responsible for the militia that protects the city against its enemies, while also serving as its *de facto* police. In this task, she is assisted by a group of loyal guards known as the [[Masks of Blades]]. Mera Bantikere, unlike some of her fellow Kings and Queens of Vyre, is not under the control of the cult of [[Norgorber]] that is secretly so pervasive throughout the city.
