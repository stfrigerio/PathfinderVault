> **Olordaera** is a [[Veiled master|veiled master]] who has walked the streets of [[Katapesh city|Katapesh City]] under a number of disguises. It currently wears two: Pactbroker [[Hashim ibn Sayyid]], whom it murdered a few weeks after his appointment; and **Voxuvika**, fictional child of the great wyrm [[Red dragon|red dragon]] Urkarax.



## Relatives

> Urkarax, sire of Voxuvika, did exist six millennia ago but vanished without a trace long before Olordaera's arrival, and currently exists only as an [[Illusion|illusion]]. It intends for those that investigate Voxuvika's identity to learn of Urkarax, and few are willing to continue after learning that Voxuvika is the child of a great wyrm red dragon.


## Associates

> Through mundane coercion and manipulation, Olordaera has managed to turn the [[Pactmasters|Pactmaster]] Jinvar to its side. Jinvar believes that Hashim is secretly Urkarax's servant and is giving [[Arcane magic|arcane]] secrets to him through a mutually beneficial agreement. With Olordaera's [[Magic|magic]], he has covertly begun a coup against the other Pactmasters and believes that finishing the *mesh repeater* under Katapesh will cement his undisputed role, allowing it to connect to *mesh repeaters* elsewhere. The other Pactmasters suspect that something is amiss but are unsure what that might exactly be.
> Since its arrival in Katapesh, Olordaera infiltrated and eliminated a cell of the [[Night Heralds]] and learnt secrets of the [[Dominion of the Black]]. It recognises the threat posed by the Dominion to [[Golarion]], and is quickly searching for a *countdown clock* to analyse and assess when the Dominion will arrive. Its [[Flumph|flumph]] ally Lorcdalie shares its goal against the Dominion of the Black but is unaware of its true nature.
> Olordaera is opposed by [[Shimon-Je]], an abolitionist reviled across Katapesh, who learnt the truth of Hashim's death and discovered Olordaera's identity. It has hired the bounty hunter Qiloc to hunt Shimon-Je down, and has controlled the information enough to convince [[Wynsal Starborn]] that Shimon-Je is a fugitive.
> With the [[Steel Falcons|Gray Corsairs]] engaged in fighting [[Slavery|slavery]] on its doorstep, Olordaera has officially requested Wynsal Starborn's help. Since these requests seem to be ignored, Olordaera has started (secretly and deniably) sending [[Weapon|weapons]] to [[Abrogail Thrune II]].
> Olordaera has requested a [[Firearm|firearm]] trade with Anong Arunak, High King of [[Dongun Hold]], after learning that [[Nex (person)|Nex]] might be coming back soon.
> Olordaera was responsible for introducing [[Kassi Aziril]] to kandlerae, a rare alga that led her to many [[Medicine|medical]] achievements, and has since continued to observe her and support her spread of [[Atheism|atheism]]. By helping her to develop non-[[Divine magic|divine healing]], Olordaera hopes to erode the very concept of religion.
> The Mhalssthru has warned Olordaera that it is in danger of breaking the last dictum of the [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]] (to overreach is to threaten the eternal), and that they will have to liquidate Olordaera if its plan fails.


## Possessions

> Olordaera possesses a *[[Charm of aluum control|charm of aluum control]]*, which grants it command over the [[Aluum|aluums]] scattered across Katapesh.
