> **Urtleytlar** is a [[Scylla|scylla]] and one of the lesser [[Spawn of Rovagug]].



## Appearance

> Urtleytlar's alternate form is a strangely beautiful [[Cyclops|cyclops]], perhaps because of a kinship she feels with the ancient empire of [[Ghol-Gan]] that used to rule her current home. This alternate form has tricked many explorers of Ghol-Gan, easing them into complacency before Urtleytlar consumes them.


## History

> After having escaped from the [[Dead Vault]] into [[Orv]], Urtleytlar swam the [[Sightless Sea]] for centuries, raiding [[Drow|drow]] coastal settlements in [[Sekamina]] before making it up the [[Braid]], raiding the [[Inverted Sea|Inverted Seas]] [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]] and emerging into the broken continent of [[Azlant]].
> Urtleytlar spent her first millennia on the surface terrorising the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] eastern coast. After [[Aroden|Arodens]] death, Urtleytlar felt the ensuing surge of [[Chaos|chaos]] and the call of [[Rovagug]] to the east, to the [[Inner Sea region]]. She saw the [[Eye of Abendego]] as a manifestation of the Rough Beast's destructive power, delights in it, and preaches Rovagug's words of destruction through the ruin she sows.


## Servants

> Urtleytlar has gathered numerous [[Evil|evil]] aquatic [[Humanoid|humanoids]] and sailors, who extend her reach to the [[Sodden Lands]] and [[Shackles]]. Some say she guides foolish sailors hoping to sail into the storm, providing them temporary safety in exchange for a taste of their [[Soul|souls]].
> A handful of Urtleytlar's [[Boggard|boggard]] [[Slaves|slaves]] offer slaves to her as sacrifices. She makes choice selections among them, leaving the scraps to the boggards. She enjoys their adoration, even though the boggards are not necessary for her plans of conquest.
> Urtleytlar also counts in her service hundreds of [[Skum|skum]] in the sunken ruins of [[Lirgen]]. They deal with the boggards and [[Human|humans]] in the Sodden Lands, provide Urtleytlar with slaves and food, and she strengthens their reach by aiding them in their destructive endeavours.
> Urtleytlar uses Megrexti, her [[Charybdis|charybdis]] counterpart, as a living [[Weapon|weapon]], sending it into the middle of fleets and delighting in the ensuing mayhem.
