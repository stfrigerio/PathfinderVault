> **Mr. Tembs** is one of the most notorious inhabitants of [[Vodavani Lodge|Havenguard Lunatic Asylum]] in the city of [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]].

More fascinating to [[Beaurigmand Trice|Dr Beaurigmand Trice]], head doctor of Havenguard Lunatic Asylum, is the fact that Mr. Tembs seems to possess at least three distinct and uniquely murderous personalities.
