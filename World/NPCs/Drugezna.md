> **Drugezna** is the young and charismatic chieftain of the [[Wyrmtooth Tribe]] of [[Taiga giant|taiga giants]]. She has led the tribe in their quest to seek revenge against the [[White dragon|white dragon]] [[Sjohvor]], who killed a half-dozen of her clan's elders during an elder's conclave centuries ago. Drugezna has learnt of a clan of [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbaric]] [[Tsolniva]] [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] that has aligned with the white dragon, and plans to erase them from the [[Ice Steppes]].
