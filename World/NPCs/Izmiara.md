> **Izmiara, the Insatiable Queen**, has ruled the [[Moonscar]] and its [[Succubus|succubus]] inhabitants for the 12,000 years since the blight's accidental creation by the ancient [[Azlant|Azlanti]], and has spent that time working to ensure the apotheosis of her patron, the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Nocticula]], into true [[God|godhood]].


## History

> Izmiara has ruled the [[Demon|demonic]] jungles of the Moonscar since their creation thousands of years in the past, but seeks to expand her dominion, and that of Nocticula, to cover all of [[Golarion]]. For that purpose, she sends her servants and agents to the surface of the world to kidnap victims to use as breeding stock or to subvert into sleeper agents to be seeded back into Golarion's societies. Izmiara and her followers have been able to place agents in multiple important positions throughout Golarion's societies, including [[Vudra|Vudrani]] royalty, the ranks of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] [[House of Thrune]], and the leadership of [[Mwangi]] tribes, to be activated when the succubi see fit through use of *[[Mindbind figurine|mindbind figurines]]* linked to each sleeper agent. Other pawns, subverted and activated in the past, have included the [[Taldor|Taldan]] general [[Erestos Marburran]], the [[Abadar|Abadaran]] archbanker Miliana Vistrara, and a [[Runelords|runelord of wrath]].
> Izmiara's efforts, however, are hampered by the immense distance between Golarion and its [[Moon Golarion|moon]]. While some succubi are able to tame [[Shantak|shantaks]] to shorten the trip between the two celestial bodies, others are restricted to their own flight and power for this trip and thus require two years of travel to reach Golarion from their lunar base.


## Recent events

> Izmiara's operations were accelerated when an ancient and long-buried Azlanti space station was unearthed by the eruption of a [[Volcano|volcano]] in the southern [[Mindspin Mountains]] known as the [[Growling Skald]], which had been dormant since before [[Earthfall]]. This ruin included the *Somal Gate*, a [[Portal|portal]] to the surface of the Moon, which, although long inactive due to lack of power, was reactivated by the geothermal energy of the newly active volcano. This development has given Izmiara and her servants direct, nearly instantaneous access to Golarion's surface, allowing them to greatly increase the pace and speed of their harvests of [[Mortal|mortal]] victims.
