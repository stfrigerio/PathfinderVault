> From his court in [[Elidir]], **Hedvend VI** rules [[Isger]] as steward. Following the [[Goblinblood Wars]], he stationed the remains of the Isgeri military along the [[Conerica Straits]]. Banditry runs rampant, but as long as trade flows from [[Cheliax]] to [[Druma]], the steward is not overly concerned.
> In truth, it is well known that he is beholden to [[Cheliax]], like his fathers before him. He makes regular trips to [[Egorian]], obediently answering the summons of [[House Thrune]].
