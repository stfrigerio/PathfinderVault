> **Xilganni Parastric** was a [[Drow|drow]] who specialised in [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]] and originally lived near [[Zirnakaynin]], most probably in the [[Moaning Vault]]. Unfortunately, Xilganni was captured by one of her [[Orc|orc]] [[Slavery|slaves]] called [[Mother Chot]]. Mother Chot dragged Xilganni Parastric from her home in the [[Darklands]], emerging on the surface world near the eastern [[Kodar Mountains]] where she allied with the [[Mangled Limb tribe]]. After securing her position within the tribe, Mother Chot turned to torturing the secrets of fleshwarping from her former mistress. Using Xilganni's secrets, Mother Chot established her [[Laboratory|laboratory]]-fortress of [[Dretha's Cradle|Drethas Cradle]], where she uses fleshwarping to create new and horrible warbeasts: semi-living warmachines and, perversely, [[Oronci|oronci]] made from her fellow orcs. Mother Chot has not forgotten her former mistress, however, and bits of Xilganni now make up the unique [[Flesh golem|flesh golem]] that the ancient [[Alchemist|alchemist]] uses to carry her wherever she goes.
