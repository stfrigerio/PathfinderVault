> **Falgood Boles**, captain of the [[Ship|brig]] *[[Bitter Wind]]*, founded the small port of [[Bogsbridge]] in the [[Motaku Isle]] in the [[Shackles]] after he had a vision of [[Besmara]]. He believed Besmara had tasked him to build a port in this marshy wetland, completely unsuitable for any reasonable development. The devout [[Pirate|pirate]] developed the settlement using his personal wealth, despite the boggy location and the fact that no large ship could use this harbor. He paid carpenters and stonemasons and built a pier, a warehouse, and a two-story inn which he named [[Besmara's Favor|Besmaras Favor]]. Boles lived there alone with his wife for 2 years. The marsh was gradually silting the harbor when Falgood Boles discovered a unique breed of snail in the surrounding marshes that produced a rare purple dye. The discovery made Falgood Boles a fortune and since then the town has grown. The town still continues to harvest the lucrative snails, transporting them via a sandy road to [[Lilywhite]] where the dye is shipped far and wide. Besmara's Favor thrives and is currently tended by Bole's cheerful granddaughter, [[Tendry Boles]], who is also the mayor of the town.
