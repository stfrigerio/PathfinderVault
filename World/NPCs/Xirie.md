> **Xirie** was the first [[Runelord|runelord]] of sloth and ruler of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] realm of [[Haruka]]. Her reign spanned from [[-6480 AR]] to [[-6150 AR]], when she was slain by [[Nocticula]] through the patsy [[Angothane]]. One of the most powerful followers of [[Colyphyr]], Xirie's death distracted her patron, allowing Nocticula to assassinate Colyphyr, and set in motion a schism that led to the deaths of Angothane himself and two other runelords at the hands of [[Xanderghul]].
