> **Malefactor Tryfilion** is the ruler of the [[Urdefhan|urdefhan]] city of [[Niovengia]], by virtue of his dedication to [[Trelmarixian]], the Horseman of Famine. Tryfilion's position is cemented by his possession of a spiked gauntlet called the *Misery Gage*, an [[Artifact|artifact]] gifted to him by Trelmarixian that once belonged to the favoured servitor of the Horseman's predecessor, Lyutheria, the Parasite Queen. Some urdefhans believe that Tryfilion is poised to lead their entire race.
