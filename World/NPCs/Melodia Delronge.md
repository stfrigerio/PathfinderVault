> **Archbaroness Melodia Delronge** is the head of the [[Kintargo|Kintargan]] aristocratic [[House Delronge]], one of the noble houses that makes up the [[Court of Coin]]. Melodia Delronge's political loyalties lie much more with the ruling powers of [[House Thrune]] than the rebellious city of Kintargo. Her interests include [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]] breeding and hunting, while her House makes its money from trade.
