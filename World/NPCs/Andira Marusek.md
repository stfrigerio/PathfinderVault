> **Supreme Elect Andira Marusek** has been the elected leader of [[Andoran]] and its [[People's Council|Peoples Council]] since [[4716 AR]]. Before entering politics, she was a general and commander of the [[Steel Falcons]], the branch of the Andoren [[Eagle Knights]] tasked in fighting [[Slavery|slavery]] and tyranny throughout the [[Inner Sea region]].


## Background

> Andira was born to a wealthy family in [[Augustana]], and grew up without needs or wants. As a gift for her fifteenth birthday, her parents paid for a voyage to [[Niswan]]. During her return journey, her [[Ship|ship]] was ambushed by slaver galleys, and she was forced to serve as a rower for a few months until a fleet of [[Gray Corsairs]] freed her. One of the Gray Corsairs was named Andira Galimnos; Andira Marusek believed that they shared the same first name for a reason, and became determined to join the Eagle Knights to help others.
> When she returned to Augustana, Andira's parents were horrified by the thought of their daughter setting off to fight slavery, but were eventually convinced after a few months. Andira presented herself at the [[Golden Aerie]] and started learning [[Philosophy|philosophy]], diplomacy, negotiation, and politics with zeal, eventually becoming one of the youngest members of the Eagle Knights' [[Twilight Talons]]. During this time, she worked with the [[Bellflower Network]] in disguise, met with [[Martum Fallows|Martum]] and [[Magdelena Fallows]], and witnessed many horrific abuses of slaves (especially [[Halfling|halflings]]), all of which only furthered her disgust for [[Cheliax]].
> Despite her successful career, Andira soon left the Twilight Talons and joined the Steel Falcons, so she could better serve as an inspirational figure much like Andira Galimnos before her. In her new position, Andira travelled widely, publicly pushed for abolition of slavery, and boldly raided slaver [[Galleon|galleons]] across the Inner Sea region. She soon became General of the Steel Falcons, serving under [[Reginald Cormoth|General Reginal Cormoth]], the commander of the Eagle Knights.


### Political career

> In [[4716 AR]], after [[Codwin]] stepped down following three terms as Supreme Elect, Marusek won election to the office as his successor, and was sworn in on the eve of her 30th birthday.
> Despite overtures from [[Grand Prince|Grand Princess]] [[Eutropia Stavian]], Andira finds that the relationship between Andoran and [[Taldor]] is still strained, as Eutropia's father [[Stavian III]] still considered Andoran as Taldan territory. She is on good terms with [[Telandia Edasseril|Queen Telandia Edasseril]] of [[Kyonin]] and encourages her reforms, and the two have collaborated over the integration of [[Elf|elves]] and others in [[Greengold]]. She has built a clandestine alliance with [[Camilia Drannoch]], the new leader of [[Galt]], who wishes to destroy the *[[Nethys/Artifacts/Final Blade|final blades]]* and end the worst excesses of the [[Red Revolution]]. Andira despises Cheliax for its [[Diabolism|diabolism]], tyrannical rule, and embrace of [[Slavery|slavery]], and [[Abrogail Thrune II]] returns the feelings.
> Andira particularly prefers to unleash the Gray Corsairs on [[Katapesh|Katapeshi]] slave ships, to the point that [[Olordaera|Pactbroker Hashim ibn Sayyid]] has seemingly given up on even token admonishments of Andoran for sacking these ships. These Gray Corsairs often rest in [[Absalom]], since [[Wynsal Starborn]] banned slavery in the city, something which is seen as the sign of an implicit alliance between Andoran and Absalom. Andira prefers a peaceful approach with [[Qadira]], hoping that [[Deena al-Parishat]] can peacefully change her people's opinion. The [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] in Katapesh despise Andira and fear her future crackdowns.
