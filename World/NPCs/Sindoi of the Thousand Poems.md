> **Sindoi of the Thousand Poems**, poet, [[Nomarch]] of the [[Chamber of Ecclesials]], and Envoy of [[Jalmeray]], is an elderly [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]] [[Human|man]] who has led the [[Ascendant Court|Ascendant Courts]] district council for eight decades. An accomplished [[Philosopher|philosopher]] and [[Art|artist]], he professes worship of all [[Deity|gods]] and none, and has never voted on a single issue of the council. He offers advice only when asked directly, and tends to prompt advice-seekers for what they believe the best solution to their problems are. Nevertheless, his poignant comments have the power to sway dozens of votes. His stance on religion has also made him quite unpopular with the district's various religious leaders.
