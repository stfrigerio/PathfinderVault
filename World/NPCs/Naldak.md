>  **Naldak** is King Gutheran's youngest son. Around [[1600 AR]], he fled with a group of [[dwarves]] from [[Jormurdun]], and founded the dwarven town of [[Naldak's Point]]. His father entrusted him with a piece of the *[[Sky Key]]* to Jormurdun, which has been passed on to Naldak's descendants since his death.
