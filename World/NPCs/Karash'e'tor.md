> **Karash'e'tor the Black** was a [[Demon|demon]] who was slain by [[Ilnea|St Ilnea]] in a rock-ringed vale along the [[Menador Mountains]], in [[Cheliax]]. The injuries he inflicted killed Ilnea, however, though the woman's body vanished into the earth and became the site of a miraculous spring now known as [[St Ilnea's Fountain|St Ilneas Fountain]].
