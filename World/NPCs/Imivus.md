> **Paracount Imivus** was a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] [[Osirionologist]] who wrote the *Aucturn Lexicon* in [[4657 AR]], and was one of the pre-eminent authorities of the [[Aucturn Enigma]], the connection between the [[Planet|planet]] [[Aucturn]] and the [[Four Pharaohs of Ascension]] of [[Osirion|Ancient Osirion]]. The original copy of the *Aucturn Lexicon* is kept under lock and key in the restricted section of the [[Grand Athenaeum]] in [[Egorian]]. Imivus is credited for discovering the strange reoccurrence of the numbers 11 and 56 in regards to Aucturn, and for figuring out how to [[Summon|summon]] the burial pyramid of the Four Pharaohs of Ascension from the [[Demiplane|demiplane]] of [[Ramlock's Hallow|Ramlocks Hallow]]. Imivus is thought to have died while exploring this demiplane.
