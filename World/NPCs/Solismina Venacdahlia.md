> The Countess of [[Ardeal]], **Solismina Venacdahlia, n√©e Croscamille,** sees herself and her family as the truest embodiment of the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] tradition and at ninety years of age is stubbornly set in her beliefs. Solismina has not dealt well with the [[Valislav Ordranti|Eunuch Prince]] moving the capital of Ustalav away from her home city of [[Ardis]] to distant [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]] despite this happening over thirty years ago in [[4674 AR]]. Solismina clings to the heritage of Ardeal almost as tenaciously as she clings to life much to the chagrin of her ambitious daughters [[Lasara Venacdahlia|Lasara]], [[Radania Venacdahlia|Radania]], [[Opaline Venacdahlia|Opaline]] and [[Floriama Venacdahlia|Floriama]]. Her husband was [[Olomon Venacdahlia|Count Olomon Venacdahlia]].
