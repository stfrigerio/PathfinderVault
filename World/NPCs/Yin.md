> **Empress Yin** was a ruler of ancient [[Yixing|Imperial Yixing]] and she was most famous for visiting the recently founded city of [[Goka]] in [[326 AR]]. Her advisors engineered the visit in an attempt to persuade her to annex it but, instead, Yin fell in love with the city and granted it status as an independent city in perpetuity.
