> **Ladonica** is a legendary [[Hydra|hydra]] that lives in the well-watered woodlands of the [[River Kingdoms]]. The beast is enchanted with powerful [[Fey|fey]] energies after it accidentally stumbled upon a gateway to the [[First World]] in the heart of [[Wilewood]] in [[Sevenarches]]. Those who seek out Ladonica, either come back empty handed or are never heard from again.
