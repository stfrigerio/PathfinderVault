> **Halgra of the Blackened Blades** is the current [[Chief Defender]] of the small town of [[Trunau]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. She has held this position since [[4693 AR]]. She is a Trunau native who left the town when she was young to become an [[Adventurer|adventurer]], fighting from the [[Skittermounds]] to the [[Broken Shore]] and beyond. She returned to Trunau at the age of 42 with her many children, all from different fathers, to settle in and to spend the rest of her life defending her home town. She is a mountain of a woman and quick with her trademark lamp-blackened swords. Together with her sharp judgement and sense of politics, her many attributes make her the most capable leader of Trunau.
> [[Half-orc]] [[Oloch]], a [[Warpriest|warpriest]] of [[Gorum]], is one of Halgra's sons.
