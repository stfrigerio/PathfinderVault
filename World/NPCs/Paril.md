> **Archbanker Lady Paril** is the high priestess of the [[Grand Bank of Abadar Meratt|Grand Bank of Abadar]] in [[Lotheedar]], a town in the northern [[Tandak Prefecture]] of [[Taldor]]. Archbanker Lady Paril acts as a counterpoint to the influence of [[Gul Gusairne|Sir Gul Gusairne]], another prominent worshipper of [[Abadar]] who serves as the head of the Meratt County Secret Police. There are whispers that many would prefer Lady Paril running the town rather than Gul who also serves as the seneschal for deeply unpopular House Lotheed.
