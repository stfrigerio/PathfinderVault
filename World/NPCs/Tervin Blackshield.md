> **Baron Tervin Blackshield** is the nominal autocratic ruler of the town of [[Thornkeep]], located in the western [[Echo Wood]] of the [[River Kingdoms]]. Though he lives in the town's central keep with his wife and two young children, and collects taxes on business done there, his power in the town is rivaled by that of several other factions, and outsized by that of the [[Three Daggers]].
