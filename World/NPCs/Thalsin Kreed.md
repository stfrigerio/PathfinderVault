> **Thalsin Kreed** was the father of [[Thuldrin Kreed]] and lived in [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]]. He taught his son how to break people's spirits. Some say that Thalsin was the person who actually killed the last descendant of the [[Samkil family]], the young [[Jebrika Samkil|Jebrika]], in [[4679 AR]].
> A statue of Thalsin Kreed, as one of the greatest leaders in the town's history, is located in the [[Lumber Consortium Headquarters]] and is always freshly polished by Thuldrin's cowed servants.
