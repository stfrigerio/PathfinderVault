> **Grand Princess Eutropia Stavian** is the current ruler of the nation of [[Taldor]] and the daughter of its precious ruler [[Stavian III]], having inherited the throne following a civil war.



## Background

![[Stavian_III_and_his_family.jpg|right+hmed]] 

A young Grand Prince Stavian III with Eutropia and her younger brother.
> A strong-willed woman, Princess Eutropia intends to inherit the throne upon the death of her father. Such an act would be against the law of Taldor, however, as the nation follows agnatic primogeniture, and thus only male heirs are able to take the crown. Despite this, Eutropia has grown disgusted with the stagnation of Taldor and intends to force the nation into the modern world, even if that requires taking power by force. Many fear that this could result in a civil war that the nation could not afford, but Eutropia disagrees, and has been building support among the [[Taldor#Senatorial class|Senate]]. She has also been rallying the youth of Taldor to hold demonstrations and demand that the [[Primogen Crown]] appoint her as the official heir. Her father has become deeply disturbed by his daughter's actions, but trusts that Taldor will continue honoring its traditions at the time of his death. In [[4718 AR]], Eutropia successfully ascended to the throne of Taldor after an initial civil war.


## Family

> Other than her father, Princess Eutropia has a brother, [[Carrius II]], who died in an [[Horse|horse-riding]] accident, but was later resurrected.
> Her mother, Etroffe, died shortly after the birth of her younger brother. The princess was too young to remember much of her.


## Mount

> Princess Eutropia bred her horse, **Myrsensia**, with a stud from the legendary [[Al-Zabriti]] line. Although this was a diplomatic victory, she has had to keep the event a secret, as it would shock the Grand Prince's cabinet should it be revealed.
