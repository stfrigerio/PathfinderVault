> **Jarl Gnargorak**, the self-proclaimed king of all [[Frost giant|frost giants]], rules from [[Bos-Phargrumm]], an ice castle perched high among the peaks of the [[Tusk Mountains]] northwest of the [[Ginji Mesa]]. It is said that he took the title after he slew a [[Silver dragon|silver dragon]] alone and then mounted the dragon's horns on his staff and used its hide for the grip of his legendary sword's hilt. A harem of [[Cloud giant|cloud giants]] serve as his personal guard and advisors when he stays in Bos-Phargrumm. Jarl Gnargorak commands legions of frost giant warriors and he leads incursions against the [[Kellid]] tribes of the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]]. His forces are also enemies of the [[Icerender tribe]] of white-scaled [[Kobold|kobolds]] resident in the Tusk Mountains.
> Three of Gnargorak's most trusted vassal jarls are [[Karthugra]], who rides a white dragon into battle; [[Fronav]], a female [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]] who is known to wield a *Staff of the magi*; and [[Thimroth]] who leads a group of giant [[Polar bear|polar bears]].
