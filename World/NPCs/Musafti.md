> **Musafti the Burning** is one of the three Sky Masters who has been ruling [[Yjae]] since the fall of the [[Shory Empire]] alongside [[Shebe]] and [[Lokoa]]. A brash, fierce warrior, he often fights against the Shory's enemies, the Yellow Harridan and the Avalanche King, and is the only Sky Master who thinks that victory over them is possible. He always appears concealed in blue flames and carries a [[Shield|shield]] said to have been crafted by [[Jatembe]]. Unlike Lokoa and Shebe, Musafti is not an [[Aeromancer|aeromancer]] and defers to his peers in the matter of flying Yjae. His romantic advances have been refused by Shebe for millennia, so he usually supports her rival Lokoa out of spite.
