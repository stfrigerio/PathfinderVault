> **Pharaoh Jetrieti VI** ascended to the throne of [[Osirion]] in [[-2866 AR]] after the violent death of his father, [[Jetrieti V]]. His father was murdered by the undead [[Mummy|mummified]] corpses of his predecessors whose graves and bodies he had desecrated. Because of Jetrieti V's vivid example, Jetrieti VI's reign was characterized by far less greed and hubris.
