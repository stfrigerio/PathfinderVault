> The **High-Priest Not To Be Described** is a hideous figure worshipped by many inhabitants of the Plateau of [[Leng]]. He receives their sacrifices before a shadowy well in the [[Prehistoric Monastery]], and plays strange melodies upon his pipes. His face and bloated, lumpish body is always covered in a robe and veil made of yellow [[Silk|silk]].
