> **Gelrue Palane** was a [[Pathfinder]] who emerged alive from the dread dungeons of [[Eel's Skull|Eels Skull]], on [[Nalt's Island|Nalts Island]] in the [[Shackles]]. He was one of only two [[Adventurer|adventurers]] known to have survived from the expedition. No attempts, however, could restore either to full health or sanity. Palane's surviving companion eventually set himself on fire and Gelrue Palane set off for [[Besmara's Throne|Besmaras Throne]]. Poor Gelrue can be found in [[Mother Tagrette's Inn|Mother Tagrettes Inn]] in [[Queen Bes]].
