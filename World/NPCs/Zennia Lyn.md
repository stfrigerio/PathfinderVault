> **Zennia Lyn** is a [[Pathfinder]] who currently dwells on the [[Plane of Air|Elemental Plane of Air]], researching its mysteries. Zennia has devoted herself to studying [[Spheres|The Spheres]], mysterious spheres of steel and bronze that dot the entire plane. Zennia however does not try to translate the unreadable script that cover their surface, instead she observes and documents their stately movements in the belief that they reveal profound secrets about the [[Great Beyond|Multiverse]]. These studies have already yielded impressive results and Zennia believes she is on the cusp of a monumental discovery, unfortunately this has attracted unwanted attention. The [[Djinni|djinni]], the inhabitants of the Plane of Air, have a strong taboo surrounding the Spheres and Zennia's work has aroused their ire and now they seek to disrupt her work.
