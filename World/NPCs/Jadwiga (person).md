> **Queen Jadwiga** was a daughter of the Witch Queen [[Baba Yaga]] and the first ruler of the land of [[Irrisen]]. She took the throne during the [[Winter War]] in [[3313 AR]], after conquering the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Raemerrund]] in far northwestern [[Avistan]]. During her 100 year-long reign, Queen Jadwiga established most of the country of Irrisen as it still exists today, 1,400 years later. Queen Jadwiga was removed from office, along with the first generation of her children, by [[Baba Yaga]] in [[3413 AR]]. She did not die, but was taken from [[Golarion]] to supposedly travel with her mother to parts unknown, and was replaced by her sister [[Morgannan]].
> Descendants of Baba Yaga are known as [[Jadwiga]], after the first queen.
