> Count **Bartelby Lotheed** is the eldest son of deceased Count Mercater Lotheed and administrator of the County of Meratt in [[Taldor|Taldan]]. He also serves as tribune for the town of [[Lotheedar]] and landgrave of the Hyden Marches. He remains the sole unmarried male of his family.
> Bartelby is described as tall, thin, and handsome combined with a sharp mind. He has a great interest in the arcane arts. As its steward, he spends most of his time in the [[Palace of Birdsong]] and delegates much of his responsibilities to others particularly his seneschal, Sir [[Gul Gusairne]].


## Family

> Bartelby dearly loves his family with the sole exception of his half-sister, [[Martella Lotheed]]. As she was born from an affair with a Qadiran emissary, he considers the girl’s birth an insult to his long-suffering mother and a stain on a great family legacy. His disdain was only exacerbated due to his disdain for those lacking arcane ability and he had her exiled from their home after the untimely death of their father. He also has other full-blooded siblings including a sister, Cateline, who lives elsewhere.
> He also has a great uncle, Duke [[Panivar Lotheed]] with whom he has little interaction. Bartelby believes that his uncle played a part in the suspicious death of his father and that the mage is more than he appears. Despite these concerns, Bartelby is wise enough to keep his thoughts to himself rather than risk retribution from his distant relative..
