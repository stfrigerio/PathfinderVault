*For another meaning of "Alban", please see [[Alban]].*
> **General Alban** is the governor of the city of [[Kalabuto]] in [[Sargava]]. He is a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] colonial. Alban previously served as the Praetor of [[Anthusis|Eleder]], but some sort of scandal caused the [[Utilinus|Grand Custodian]] to reassign him as far away as possible. He is openly scornful of the natives. [[Fort Kalabuto]] is Alban's home and headquarters.
> Forces from [[Mzali]] have sacked Kalabuto three times in recent years. Because of this, General Alban sends regular spying missions to Mzali to keep track of military preparations.
