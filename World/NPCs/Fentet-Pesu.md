> **High Theurgist Fentet-Pesu** was the last [[Osirion|Osirian]] governor of [[Thuvia]]. He was assassinated in [[Ruins of El-Amara|el-Amara]] in [[-841 AR]]. [[Yafeha I|Pharaoh Yafeha I]] failed to replace the assassinated governor, effectively relinquishing control of the province. Sometime after his assassination at the hands of his lover, Fentet-Pesu rose as skeletal [[Undead|undead]] and became trapped in the [[Lost Fortress of Mekshir]] in western Osirion. He possessed a scepter which contained a trigger that manipulated the [[Khamsin|khamsin]] storms responsible for burying the fortress. In his madness in plotting revenge against Yafeha I, he inadvertently triggered the storms that isolated him from the rest of the world for so long.
