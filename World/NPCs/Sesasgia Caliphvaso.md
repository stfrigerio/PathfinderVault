> **Countess Sesasgia Caliphvaso** was the woman responsible for the refounding of the city of [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]] after the end of the [[Shining Crusade]] and the defeat of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]]. She was said to have a harsh countenance, and this may be seen on a statue of her that graces [[Restoration Park]] in the heart of Caliphas, the city she helped rebuild.
