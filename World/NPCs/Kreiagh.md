> **Winglord Kreiagh**, the Breath of the Mountain, is the leader of the [[Giant owl|giant owls]] of the [[House of Sky]] in the [[Five Kings Range]]. He and his followers are allied with the [[Elves|elves]] of [[Kyonin]] to hunt their mutual enemies: [[Treerazer]] and his [[Demon|demonic]] minions. Although the owls frequently disagree with each other in their long, hooting council meetings, they take every utterance of Kreiagh's to heart.
