> **Lamya Nilawi** is a member of the [[Marrow Reavers]] adventuring group. In the past she was also a member of the now defunct Gilded Tusks mercenary group; and she was expelled from the Severed Paw mercenaries of [[Fort Longjaw]]. Nilawi's grandfather was a [[Jackalwere|jackalwere]] and this monstrous link has led her into the worship of [[Lamashtu]].
