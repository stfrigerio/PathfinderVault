> **Rajah Hemanth** is a ruler of one of the many [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapadas]] that make up the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]]. Hemanth's kingdom lies within the [[Golden Basin]] region of Vudra and within a smaller area known as [[Sacred Soil]]. This area is one of the most fertile in all Vudra and its wheat fields, orchards, and rice paddies make it known as "the Breadbasket of Vudra".
