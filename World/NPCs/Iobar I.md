> **Iobar**, son of [[Kjell]], was the first king of a united [[Iobaria]], as well as the nation's namesake. The heir to the throne of [[Orlov]], he tricked the nine koffars of [[Njalgard]] into trial by combat, and besting them, usurped their rule and proclaimed a new nation that reached from the [[Icewall]] north of [[Mendev]] to the [[Castrovin Sea]].
> Iobar I would meet his end at the [[Battle of Kridorn]] in [[937 AR]], when he was slain trying to drive off the [[Pirate|pirates]] who plagued Iobaria's Castrovin coast. His son [[Hrugil]] would take up his fight, and drive the pirates from Iobaria.
