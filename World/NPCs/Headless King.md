*For another meaning of "Headless King", please see [[Ydersius]].*
> The **Headless King** is the original [[Fey|fey]] [[Dullahan|dullahan]] who resides in the [[First World]], and the original template for the [[Undead|undead]] dullahans on the [[Material Plane]]. He rides the Syrington Downs at night, and local residents rarely leave their home after dark, lest they fall prey to the Headless King and become baying hounds.
