> **Aldair Eámon** is the red-headed leader of the Scions faction of the [[Brothers of the Seal]] order in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]]. A natural showmen he willingly preaches the Scions' cause to anyone who will listen. Aldair argues that the seal is not something to be protected but is a test simply waiting for a [[Monk|monk]] strong enough to decide to harness whatever its secret is for himself. While he is called betrayer by many, he argues that none can remember what it is they are supposed to be protecting, nor from whom, nor why they protect it. They do not even know who appointed them to protect the seal. Aldair Eámon shows no fear of anything and is insatiably curious about the secrets of the seal that he once swore to protect, he is eager for battle and happily wears down his erstwhile brothers with a war of attrition.
