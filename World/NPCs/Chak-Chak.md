> **Chak-Chak** is a servile [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]] that hangs around [[Chadric of Laekastel|Chadric of Laekastels]] place, eating Chadric's food and quietly pocketing a [[Coin|coin]] once in a while. Chadric, who is the leader of the business run in [[Yelligo Wharf]] on the island of [[Dahak's Tooth|Dahaks Tooth]], keeps the tengu close by, superstitiously believing him to be the bringer of good luck.
