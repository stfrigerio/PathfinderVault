> **Lady Darchana of House Madinani** is the archdean of the [[Arcanamirium]], the most prestigious [[Magic|magical]] university in the city of [[Absalom]]. A [[Wizard|wizard]] of great power, she also holds one of the lesser seats on the [[Government of AbsalomGrand Council|Grand Council of Absalom]], and the title of [[Spell lord|second spell lord]].
> She believes wizards and [[Arcanist|arcanists]] have an imperative to share magical research with each other for the advancement of magical studies.
> Due to her [[Taldan]] loyalties, Darchana is involved in a number of political machinations. In an effort to undermine [[Goodman Hugen]] as Absalom's Harbormaster, she has encouraged students of the Arcanamirium to research magical alternatives to maritime trade. A permanent [[Teleport|teleport]] circle in one of her buildings has shown great promise, as she has begun importing expensive goods that bypass Hugen and Absalom's trade tariffs. In addition, she has taken advantage of Scion Lady Xanippe of [[House Tevineg|House Tevinegs]] romantic interest and turned her against Scion Lady Neferpatra of [[House Ahnkamen]], whom she claims is keeping them apart.
> By disrupting power, she hopes to destroy all the high seats of the Grand Council, and anoint [[Eutropia Stavian|Princess Eutropia Stavian]] as Queen of Absalom, reclaiming the city for [[Taldor]].
