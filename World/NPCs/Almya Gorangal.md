> A generally disagreeable [[Cheliax|Chelish]] [[Pathfinder]] of [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisian]] descent, **Almya Gorangal** is currently located in southern [[Varisia]]. Almya uses the [[Heidmarch Manor]] [[Pathfinder lodge|lodge]] in the [[Naos]] region of [[Magnimar]] as her base of operations. From here, Almya frequently ventures into the [[Mushfens]] south of Magnimar, looking for [[Thassilon]] ruins from the sunken kingdom of [[Eurythnia]], dredging artefacts from the sodden lands where they now lay. The unpleasant nature of this work certainly does not help Almya's already disagreeable personality.
