> **Argus Berekland** was an explorer who discovered placer gold at the base of the [[Gold Falls]] of [[Foam River]]  in the area of [[Darkmoon Vale]] in [[Andoran]], in [[4437 AR]]. Argus and a small group of friends built a sluice on the ruins of a wide bridge that collapsed in one of the massive earthquakes during the [[Rending]] as well as the heavily defended [[Gold Falls Inn]] on the ruins of a small [[Dwarf|dwarven]] fortress which controlled the wide bridge. The fort was abandoned when the bridge collapsed. The Berekland family still operates the Gold Falls Inn and the sluice above the falls.
