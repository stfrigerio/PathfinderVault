> **Xulchuwath** is the ferocious, short-tempered creator of the [[Vault of the Onyx Citadel]]. Brilliant even by [[Vault Builders|Vault Builder]] standards, it developed the vault's artificial [[Ley line|ley lines]] and built the Stone Roads to allow its people to travel the cosmos. It has long since left its creation behind, but its interest was drawn back when the *[[Onyx Key]]* was discovered millennia ago, and when the vault was invaded by [[Azaersi]], Xulchuwath started a slow journey back to cleanse its creation of vermin.
