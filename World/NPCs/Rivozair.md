> **Rivozair** is a [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] who has menaced the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Kintargo]] off and on for decades. She is most famous for losing the last battle against the city's [[Silver Ravens]] before [[House Thrune]] reclaimed the city in [[4640 AR]].


## Background

> Rivozair rose to prominence during the Chelish Civil War, where she took advantage of the nation's political turmoil to attack the city of Kintargo. She was driven off by the Silver Ravens, and was forced to retreat to a remote island west of the [[Dismal Nitch]] to recover from the injuries she received in the clash. Although she continued to attack passing [[Ship|shipping]] and nearby fishing villages, she did not return to Kintargo.
> Many years later, Rivozair was contacted by [[Barzillai Thrune]], who offered her the chance to avenge herself on Kintargo on the condition of becoming devil-bound. Finding this an acceptable price for striking back at the city, Rivozair agreed and became bound to a [[Horned devil|horned devil]]. She returned to Kintargo shortly after the [[Night of Ashes]], as Barzillai's violent reprisal against the faiths of [[Milani]] and [[Sarenrae]] in Kintargo became known, using a *dimension door* [[Spell|spell]] to enter a secret chamber beneath the [[Kintargo Opera House]]. She periodically emerges using the same method in order to hunt in Kintargo's hinterlands, but Barzillai has prevented her from having a more obvious presence in the city.
