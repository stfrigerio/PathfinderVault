> **High King Borogrim the Hale** of [[Highhelm Militia]] rules from [[Stonehall]] on King's Motte hill. He helped the city grow into a main trade centre, recognized throughout [[Avistan]].
> King Borogrim rules as ruler of the dwarven nation of [[Highhelm Militia]], one of the six dwarves who rule the [[Five Kings Mountains]], though other city leaders consult with him regularly on major issues. He convenes an official meeting with the [[Gathering Council]] every 200 years (though the meetings have been known to drag on for months).
> The king has made Highhelm an ideal place for merchants by enforcing a low tax rate on imported goods.
