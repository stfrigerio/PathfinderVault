> **Tyruwat** the Lost One is an insane follower of [[Zon-Kuthon]]. He is the owner of the deadly artifact known as the [[Song of Extinction]], and he used it to devour the souls of the people of [[Dokaren]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]], granting himself a greatly extended lifetime as a result.
> He currently lives in a crypt beneath the grand temple of Dokaren, served by packs of howlers and a tribe of wild elves.
