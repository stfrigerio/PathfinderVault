> According to [[Jistka Imperium|Jistkan]] hagiography, **Ejanos** was the older brother of [[Arustun]]. The two brothers rediscovered the [[Azlant|Azlanti]] treasures in the [[Cave of Tiandra]] in approximately [[-4160 AR]]. Ejanos wanted to burn the strange scrolls as fuel but Arustun, knowing that these relics were important contested his brother and inadvertently killed him. With Ejanos' death, Arustun suddenly gained the ability to understand the writings and quickly absorbed these sparse treasures of Azlanti lore while in the cave.
