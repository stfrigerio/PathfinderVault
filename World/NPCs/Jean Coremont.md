> **Jean Coremont** (sometimes spelt **Jean Coromont**) is [[Taldor|Taldors]] most famous corsair. His exploits have earned him the nickname the "Lion of Taldor". He has sunk more [[Cheliax|Chelish]], [[Andoran|Andoren]], and [[Qadira|Qadiran]] merchant [[Ship|ships]] than any other corsair in service to the empire. The base of his small fleet is the city of [[Cassomir]]. Jean Coremont's secret is that he is a [[Lion Blades|Lion Blade]], and was trained as a youth by the mysterious [[Shadow Schools]] in [[Oppara]].
> Jean Coremont's current flagship is the *Happenstance*; [[Sebastian Tambour]] is the first mate on the ship.
