> **Marrian Carameizta** is one of the two owners, along with her brother [[Paulo Carameizta]], of the prestigious [[Palace of Voices]] which she inherited from her parents. While she adores the lure of the stage, and the prestige and influence it affords her, Marrian detests her co-owner, Paulo. They have opposite views about how the Palace of Voices should be run, as well as nursing numerous sibling grudges, and old petty rivalries. This feud has gotten so bad that the Palace of Voices now has to be effectively run by the conductor [[Aldentor Rudono]].
