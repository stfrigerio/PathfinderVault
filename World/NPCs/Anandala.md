> **Anandala** is the current Grand Mistress of the [[Monastery of Unblinking Flame]] in [[Jalmeray]]. She is said to have been exiled from her home in [[Vudra]] for dishonouring her family, but refuses to talk about this subject. After arriving in Jalmeray, she was accepted into the Monastery of Unblinking Flame due to her skills and martial arts talents, and quickly became its leader. Despite her apparent young age, she has held this position for decades and has no apparent plan to abdicate soon.
