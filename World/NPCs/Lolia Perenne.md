> **Lolia Perenne** is the Magistrate of Regulation for the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]].  A former [[Cleric|priest]] of [[Abadar]], her office oversees the orderly and lawful conduct of trade within the city.  She and her staff spend most of their time searching for imbalanced scales and weights, shaved coins, and other means by which merchants and customers cheat each other.
