> **Andel Gesseran** is a [[Pathfinder]] who actively seeks to find a group of Pathfinders who would like his expertise in ancient cultures such as [[Thassilon]], [[Azlant]], or the [[Jistka Imperium]]. Educated in [[Kintargo]], the well-traveled scribe is also a researcher, author, explorer and polyglot member of the [[Pathfinder Society]]. He has a great passion for knowledge and a keen mind.  Gesseran is currently in [[Magnimar]], [[Varisia]], researching the fantastic ancient empire of [[Thassilon]], hoping to see the sites and ruins himself in the near future.
> In [[4714 AR]], Andel Gesseran was among the [[Ratfolk|ratfolk]] of the [[Dirt Sea]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]] studying their culture. He was especially interested in their myth of the Hollow Rat that lives deep in the earth.
> At some point in his adventuring career, Gesseran also visited [[Numeria]] to investigate [[Crowhollow]] looking for the mysterious [[Mountain Crow tribe]].


## Appearance

> Andel cuts the figure of a classic Pathfinder: a lean young man striding from city streets to wilderness, walking stick in hand, well-worn map out, and a pack stuffed with still more [[Scroll|scrolls]].
