> **Deveera Gadsel** is an artist in the town of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] in [[Andoran]]. Her workshop, the [[Woodwil]], serves also as a gathering place for a number of semi-artistic locals in town. [[Ayda Vorshin]] of the [[High Market]] sees the growing popularity of Deveera's crafts as cutting into her profits of her own import business. Deveera is trying to organize a guild to provide mutual protection from Vorshin. The [[Lumber Consortium]] is paid a share of Deveera's profits as an "administrative fee".
