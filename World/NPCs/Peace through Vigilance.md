> **Peace through Vigilance** is a unique [[Celestial creature|celestial]] [[Gold dragon|gold dragon]] in the service of the [[God|goddess]] [[Iomedae]].


## Background

> Still quite young, very talkative, and perpetually restless, the young [[Dragon|dragon]] hardly lets anyone who [[Calling|calls]] him get a word in edgewise and is likely to take control of situations that he believes play to his strengths. He refers to his patron goddess as "Mother Iomedae", which has created the rumor that he is the offspring of Iomedae and the dragon god [[Apsu]]; others consider him to be an embodiment of a mutual defensive pact between Iomedae and Apsu. Peace through Vigilance is especially fond of [[Gem|gems]], and will likely be friendly toward anyone who offers them to him in exchange for service.
