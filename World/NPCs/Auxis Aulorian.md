> **Count Auxis Aulorian** is the head of the [[Kintargo|Kintargan]] aristocratic [[House Aulorian]], one of the noble houses that makes up the [[Court of Coin]]. Auxis Aulorian's political loyalties lie slightly more with the ruling powers of [[House Thrune]] than his rebellious home city of Kintargo; this is, however, a recent development and Auxis's rebellious son [[Marquel Aulorian]] views it as borderline treachery. Auxis's interests include [[Magic|magic]], while his House makes its money from trading in [[Silver|silver]] and [[Salt|salt]].
