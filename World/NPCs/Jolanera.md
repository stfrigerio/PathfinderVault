> **Jolanera** is a [[Nightwing|nightwing]] who lurks deep beneath the [[Isle of Terror]] and seeks knowledge about the [[Plane|planes]] so she can engulf [[Golarion]] in the [[Well of Sorrows]]. Formerly a servant of [[Tar-Baphon]], she is now working for his [[Black dragon|black dragon]] rival [[Karamorros]].


## Associates

> During Tar-Baphon's long imprisonment, Jolanera has continued to follow the terms of the agreement she struck with him, such as not coming to the [[City of Golden Death]] and [[Fort Landing]]), so that, once he is free, she might convince the Whispering Tyrant that she still serves him. Karamorros is pleased by this ruse, as she hopes to trick Tar-Baphon into trusting Jolanera until she can avenge her children. However, Jolanera keeps secret an alternative plan to betray Karamorros to Tar-Baphon just in case it is more beneficial to her. Jolanera even hides Karamorros' existence from her own servants, lest the knowledge leak out to Tar-Baphon's minions who might then attack her.
> Jolanera has determined that she needs powerful living creatures as sacrifices in her research, and seeks to find them among trespassers. Those with advanced knowledge of [[Magic/Conjuration|conjuration]] might be forced to work as researchers instead.


## Background

> Jolanera first came to the Isle of Terror from the [[Negative Energy Plane]], via the Wizard-King's Pit, some time after Tar-Baphon was defeated by [[Aroden]] but before he came back as a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]]. When Tar-Baphon returned, he convinced Jolanera that, in exchange for her service, he would teach her the principles of the [[Magic|magic]] that he used to tap into the Wizard-King's Pit. Unfortunately for Jolanera, he was imprisoned in [[Gallowspire]] before he could teach her. Subsequently, Jolanera explored the Wizard-King's Pit with her own minions, and found that Tar-Baphon had been hiding things from her, so she decided to investigate on her own terms.
> Eventually, she discovered that a being even more powerful than herself had clawed its way through the Wizard-King's Pit: the [[Ravener|ravener]] Karamorros. Karamorros deduced Jolanera's bargain with Tar-Baphon and offered her a similar deal, reasoning that Tar-Baphon was too weak and foolish to hold up his end of the bargain. Jolanera saw the point and agreed to assist Karamorros to further her own schemes. Despite her patience, she has become frustrated by how little progress Karamorros has made toward either of their goals in recent centuries.
