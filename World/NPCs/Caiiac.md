> **Caiiac** is an [[Adhukait|adhukait]] [[Asura|asura]] who dwells near the Voxfang spire in [[Caina]], the eighth level of [[Hell]]. This blue-crowned fiend routinely crawls up the spire to torture an insane soul that knows blasphemous secrets of the worship of [[Shelyn]], seeking ever more details about the location of a heretical treasure at the seat of the "Titan's Mind".
