> **Iridelia Charthagnion** is the wife of [[Kettermaul Charthagnion]], mayor of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Corentyn]]. Kettermaul and Iridelia's marriage was a marriage of convenience for political reasons and they sleep in separate rooms, often with separate lovers. The nobles fight for their attention nonetheless.
