> **Admiral Enfaria Weltrax**, who retired from the [[Chelish Navy]] after a prestigious career, rules the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] town of [[Halmyris]] as its lord-mayor and warden with an efficient but cold hand. 
> Despite her success, she seeks a transfer from Halmyris or release from her duties as she has little taste for the bureaucracy they entail. Dissenters also want Admiral Weltrax out, though she dismisses the more violent rumors that suggest her assassination.
