> **Sheriff Casal Tarne** is currently the head of the city guard in [[Gralton]]. Casal is [[Halidan Tarne]]'s cousin and worked for years as his unofficial advisor but eventually the two nearly came to blows. Lord General Halidan Tarne dreams of invading [[Galt]] and has been assembling an army in Gralton for years. Casal disagrees with Halidan's raids and small scale skirmishes. He believes that the army should wait to invade Galt until it becomes stronger and better organized. Now Casal is quietly waiting for Halidan to die in one of his foolish battles, at which point Casal will take over the army.
