> **Ruby Prince Khemet III**, the **Forthbringer**, is the current ruler of the nation of [[Osirion]].



## Appearance

> The prince is not quite middle-aged, with brown eyes in a still-boyish face; some speculate his youthful appearance is the consequence of drinking the *[[Sun orchid elixir|sun orchid elixir]]*. He cultivates the weak, malleable image his apparent youth inspires.


## Relatives

> Khemet III is the son of [[Khemet II]], also known as the Crocodile King, who ruled Osirion from [[4649 AR]] to [[4678 AR]]. Khemet III took the throne after his father died in a [[Magic/Conjuration|summoning]] accident.


## Background

> In [[4707 AR]], Khemet III instituted a radical new policy for the nation, when he began to open Osirion's many ancient tombs to explorers from throughout the [[Inner Sea region]]. He understood that foreign [[Adventurer|adventurers]] who traveled there would most likely sell any artifacts they found to local markets in order to make an immediate profit, which in turn would provide a valuable boost to the Osirian economy. In [[4714 AR]], after the disastrous return of Pharaoh [[Hakotep I]], Khemet reverted this policy, but only succeeded to drive the tomb-robbing business underground.


## Advisors

> Nazmi, a [[Celestial|celestial]] [[Gynosphinx|gynosphinx]] servant of [[Abadar]], advises the prince, who allows the [[Council of Sun and Sky]] to manage most of the mundane government functions while he manages the byzantine elemental and planar pacts that underlie Osirion's independence.
> The prince bears two unusual wondrous items as the rightful heir of the [[Khemet I|Dynasty of the Forthbringers]]: the *[[Crook of the Ancient Serpent]]* as his rod of office, and the *[[Ruby circlet]]* beneath his pharaonic headpiece, which allows him to communicate with his invisible [[Fire elemental|fire elemental]] advisor [[Janhelia]]. Visitors to court often pay to have an *[[Endure elements|endure elements]]* spell cast upon them, in case they find themselves in Janhelia's vicinity.
> He is protected by the fanatically loyal [[Risen Guard]], who are also responsible for the safety of his family. At this time, his heirs are his twin younger siblings [[Ojan]] and [[Jasilia]].


## Politics

> A powerful summoner, the Ruby Prince has negotiated agreements with [[Genie|genies]] of air, water, and fire, as well as the [[Angel|angelic]] and [[Fiendish|fiendish]] servants of several gods. Some observers fear that Khemet III is too embroiled in the politics of the [[Elemental|elementals]] of the desert, and mutter darkly that such entanglements always end badly for mortals.
> The Osirian Army has been growing steadily during his reign, but the reason for this military build-up is not known.
> In [[4679 AR]], Khemet III instituted the Laws of Equitable Use in [[Osirion]], putting strict restrictions on [[Slavery|slavery]], and chartered the [[Council of Liberated Slaves]], putting an end to the slave rebellions that threatened to bring down his father's government.
