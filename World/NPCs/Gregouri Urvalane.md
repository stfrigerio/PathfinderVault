> **Gregouri Urvalane** is the husband of [[Baelara|Baroness Baelara]], ruler of the small, peasant town [[Atvan]] on [[Glacier Lake]] in the [[Irrisen]] province of [[Bleakmarch]]. He is a notorious womanizer and the couple spend a great deal of time arguing, which is what got them banished from [[Whitethrone]] to this remote settlement. The young women of Atvan who attract Gregouri's amorous attentions became targets of the baroness' extravagant rage.
