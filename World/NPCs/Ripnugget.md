> **Warchief Ripnugget** was the leader of the [[Thistletop goblins]] of [[Varisia]]. He preferred to fight from the back of his pet [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Lizard|giant lizard]] **Stickfoot**, and used a [[Mechanics/Spells/Spells/Level 1/Magic Weapon|magical]] [[Goblin|goblin]] [[Dogslicer|dogslicer]] in melee. He led the local goblin tribes on a raid on the Varisian town of [[Sandpoint]], and was killed when a party of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] launched a revenge attack on his [[Thistletop]] lair.
> Due to the latent [[Abyss|Abyssal]] energies left behind by his ally [[Nualia Tobyn]], Ripnugget's [[Soul|soul]] did not rest, eventually rising as a [[Graveknight|graveknight]]. After a few years of rage, during which he killed any goblins that dared approach his lair, Ripnugget cooled down, seized control of a few [[Ghoul|ghouls]] and started using them to infect goblins, slowly building an army of ghoul goblins with which he plans to march on Sandpoint again once they are numerous enough.
