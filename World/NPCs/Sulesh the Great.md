> **Sulesh the Great** was a [[Kelesh|Keleshite]] [[Genie binder|genie binder]] whose works are still idolized and studied religiously to this day. Even long after his death, Sulesh remains both the best-known and most-hated genie binder in [[Kelesh]] history.
> Sulesh was known to have created many [[Genie seal|genie seals]] over his lifetime, among them the [[Artifact|artifact]] known as the *[[True Seal of Sulesh]]*. Though he tried to replicate the power and potency of this seal, he was never able to succeed.
> The *[[Bottle of the Bound]]* was a powerful artifact made by Sulesh the Great. It was the prison of an ancient [[Efreeti|efreeti]] bound by Sulesh's hand who was released by [[Osirion|Osirions]] [[Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues]]. The efreeti aided the pharaoh in binding the [[Daemonic harbinger|daemonic harbinger]] [[Zelishkar]] and the 666 [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]] rampaging through the [[Labyrinth of Shiman-Sekh]] into the efreeti's former prison.
