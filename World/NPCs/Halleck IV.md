> **Emperor Halleck IV** was ruler of the [[Cheliax|Chelaxian Empire]] at the end of the 44th, and the early part of the 45th century AR.  He is best known for ordering [[Jakthion Korvosa|Field Marshal Korvosa]] to found what would turn out to be the last Chelish colony of the [[Everwar]]: the city of [[Korvosa]] in [[Varisia]].  


## Founding of Korvosa

> In [[4404 AR]] Emperor Halleck IV signed a charter, commanding Field Marshal Jakthion Korvosa to lead a small group of soldiers and hearty colonists to found a settlement in what were then the unexplored wilds of Varisia.  The Field Marshal's main political rival, the Admiral Mercatio Kiameleu, would not be outdone, and petitioned for a similar charter.  Due to the Admiral's influence, the Emperor eventually granted his wishes later that year.
> On the 3rd day of [[Calendar|Sarenrith]] [[4406 AR]], Halleck IV signed the charter for the newly christened [[Fort Korvosa]], establishing the basic legal framework that continues to serve the city to this day.  The day is still celebrated as a holiday by the inhabitants of Korvosa, who have named it the Day of Destiny Festival.
> After Kiameleu returned back to Cheliax in disgrace in [[4408 AR]] after losing most of his expedition due to poor command, the Admiral petitioned to have his failures blamed on one of his captains, [[Keyra Palin]].  Both Korvosa and the commander of Fort Korvosa, [[Waydon Endrin]], petitioned heavily against this court-martial.  They succeeded and the Emperor demoted Kiameleu instead, passing his command to his first mate, Veldraine.


## Private Life

> Emperor Halleck was known to have been a personal friend of the Immortal Lord of Korvosa, [[Volshyenek Ornelos]], when he still resided in Cheliax.  Upon the Emperor's death in [[4437 AR]], his crown passed to his son, who named himself [[Fane II]].
