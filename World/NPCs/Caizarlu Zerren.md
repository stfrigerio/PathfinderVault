> **Caizarlu Zerren** is a silent investor in [[Habe's Sanatorium|Saintly Haven of Respite]] who resides in its basement. He was a former member of the [[Magnimar|Magnimarian]] Scarzni gang known as the [[Gallowed]] during his youth. His dabbling in [[Necromancy|necromancy]] resulted in a ousting from the gang, but not before he stole an quantity of jewels and [[Gem|gemstones]] from them.
> Finding himself transient for months, he eventually learned of a [[Varisian]] doctor [[Erin Habe]] who wished to build a Sanatorium, but lacked the funds to do so. Caizarlu invested his stolen fortune in the Sanatorium so he could continue his necromantic experiments in secret, with the Sanatorium providing him with a continuing supply of bodies.
