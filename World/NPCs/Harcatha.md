> **Harcatha** is a daughter of [[Baba Yaga]]. She was the sixth Queen of [[Irrisen]]. She reigned from [[3813 AR]] until [[3913 AR]], when she was removed from [[Golarion]] and her sister [[Sascha person|Sascha]] was placed on the throne.
> Harcatha's family felt they were being wrongly treated by the new Queen Sascha and her family, and in [[3937 AR]] they rose up in what came to be known as the [[Harcatha Rebellion]].
