> Born in the town of [[Ardis]], **Soividia Ustav** was the [[Varisian]] hero who united the fractious Varisian settlements on the northern shore of [[Lake Encarthan]], displacing the native [[Kellid]] population, and founding the nation of [[Ustalav]] in [[2361 AR]].


## History

> After defeating the Kellid shaman-king Voagx of the Stormheart clan, Ustav is said to have wrapped an important menhir central to the Kellid's religion in chains and dragged it from its holy place to Crusader's Square, the central square in Ustalav's new capital of Ardis, where he could see it from his palace. Today that stone is known as the Blindstone.
He is known to have also personally led the forces that drove the dreaded [[Death's Head tribe|Deaths Head tribe]] of [[Orc|orcs]] from the [[Hungry Mountains]], forcing them to relocate to the [[Hold of Belkzen]] to the west. After creating the nation, Ustav divided control of the various counties between his subordinates and allies, a system that would last for over 500 years.


## Descendants

> His descendants ruled Ustalav for over 500 years, bringing about what many consider to be the nation's golden age.  Ustav's royal line came to an end during the reign of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]]. After the [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] was defeated in [[38' AR]], a royal line with extremely tenuous ties to Ustav was re-established, but could not reclaim the nation's former glory.
