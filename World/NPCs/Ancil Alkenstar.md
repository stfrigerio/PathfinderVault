> **Ancil Alkenstar** was an ambitious inhabitant of [[Quantium]], in [[Nex]]. He had an early interest in [[Magic|magic]], but later replaced it with a passion for [[Technology|technology]].
> He was accused of crimes against Nex and, in [[4588 AR]], he fled into the [[Mana Wastes]] in order to avoid arrest. He found his way to the ruins of [[Dongun Hold]], and eventually established a new nation there—the Grand Duchy of [[Alkenstar]], whose capital was named [[Alkenstar City]]. This became a haven for those fleeing magical enemies.
> Alkenstar also made contact with the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] of Dongun Hold, and gained access to their greatest invention—[[Firearms|firearms]].
