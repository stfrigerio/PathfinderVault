> **Aethusa** is the most prominent emergent leader of a faction of [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] in [[New Thassilon]] who call themselves [[Runelords|runelords]] and seek to emulate what the ancient runelords of [[Thassilon]] did. She claims to be the reincarnation of two of Thassilon's runelords: the [[Aethusa runelord of greed|sixth runelord of greed]] and the [[Aethusa runelord of gluttony|third runelord of gluttony]], both named Aethusa, and styles herself as the "Thrice-born Queen".
