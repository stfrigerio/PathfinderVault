> **Eliza Petulengro** is a [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] who hails from war-torn [[Galt]]. She  returned to her homeland to reclaim the damaged [[Woodsedge Lodge]] on behalf of the [[Pathfinder Society]]. Although her presence was tolerated, she expressed disdain for public executions, and employed several disgraced nobles as her personal servants. This annoyed many, especially the more fanatical revolutionaries.
> Eliza is a talented [[Diviner|diviner]] with a vast memory for text, names, and faces. She has a habit of calling initiates by name even after meeting them only once.  Her duties in the [[Grand Lodge]] in [[Absalom]] involved managing the Society's army of librarians and administrators.
> Eliza is a member of the Pathfinder Society's ruling [[Decemvirate]]. Her membership was unknown to most Pathfinders except [[Shemis]] and a few others, until she shed her mask in [[4719 AR]] after the unmasking of [[Vahlo Huovar]]. After becoming the public face of the Decemvirate, she stepped back from her position as the venture-captain of the Woodsedge Lodge, recruiting [[Armeline Jirneau]] to take her place.
