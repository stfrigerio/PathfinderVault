> **Ryk** is the current 'owner', in the loosest sense of the word, of [[Odde 26 Daughter Herbs|Odde  Daughter Herbs]]: an old store that has changed hands numerous times and typifies the [[Old Kintargo]] district's loose attitude towards ownership. Perhaps as a result of his [[Tiefling|tiefling]] heritage and the prejudices they face even in liberal [[Kintargo]], dark rumours about the strange yet delicious meats that Ryk sells have begun to circulate.
