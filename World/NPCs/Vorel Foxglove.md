> **Vorel Foxglove** was a [[Necromancer|necromancer]] and a member of the upper class [[House Foxglove|Foxglove family]], raised in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]]. He moved from there in [[4624 AR]], building a new home, [[Foxglove Manor]], on a lonely stretch of the [[Lost Coast]]. Secretly a member of the homicidal [[Skinsaw Cult]] that masqueraded as a social club for rich merchants known as the Brothers of the Seven, Vorel financed the construction of his home with copious loans from the Brothers. In exchange, Vorel declared that Foxglove Manor would become the property of the cult in 100 years.
> Vorel lived with his wife Kasanda, their children, and a small staff of servants in Foxglove Manor for 20 years. In [[4644 AR]], Vorel was interrupted by his wife in the final stages of the necromantic rituals needed from him to become a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]]. The [[Magic|magical]] backlash consumed his body within seconds, killing Vorel and creating the [[Disease|disease]] [[Vorel's phage|Vorels phage]] in the process. The disease also killed Kasanda, their children, and all the servants of Foxglove manor, but did not spread further. Vorel's soul fused with the house, in effect becoming his phylactery. Foxglove Manor became known as being haunted and was nicknamed "Misgivings" and lay abandoned for decades. His evil spirit and the horrible disease he had accidentally created continued to plague the Foxglove family for generations, eventually causing the deaths of his great-nephew [[Traver Foxglove|Traver]], and his son [[Aldern Foxglove|Aldern]]. Vorel's spirit was finally exorcised from the house in [[4707 AR]] by a group of adventurers investigating a series of local murders committed by Aldern.
