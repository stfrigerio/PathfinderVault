**Lord Hobart Deverin** is the aging leader of [[House Deverin]] in the city of [[Magnimar]]. His willingness to mingle with the city's common folk has earned him the derogatory nickname of "the Simple Lord", but he bears that title with pride. Lord Deverin has been fighting a recurring fever for the past year, and many folk believe he is not long for this world.
> Hobart's niece, [[Kendra Deverin]], has found success as the mayor of nearby [[Sandpoint]], a fact of which he is proud.
