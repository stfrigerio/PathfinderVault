> **Paulo Carameizta** is one of the two owners, along with his sister [[Marrian Carameizta]], of the prestigious [[Palace of Voices]], which he inherited from his parents. While he adores the lure of the stage and the prestige and influence it affords him, Paulo detests his co-owner, Marrian. They have opposite views about how the Palace of Voices should be run, as well as nursing numerous sibling grudges, and old petty rivalries. This feud has gotten so bad that the Palace of Voices now has to be effectively run by the conductor [[Aldentor Rudono]].
