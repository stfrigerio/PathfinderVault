> **Xaivanshee Rasivrein** is a [[Drow|drow]] [[Cleric|cleric]] from the city of [[Zirnakaynin]] in the [[Darklands]]. She has removed herself from the machinations of her city and house, [[House Rasivrein]]. She desires to transform into a [[Vampire|vampire]] without being bitten by one - she will not serve another willingly.
> Xaivanshee is pleased with the current state of anarchy in Zirnakaynin, which has allowed her to work towards her goals with a minimum of interference. She now pursues the final step for her vampiric transformation, which was communicated to her in a vision from [[Zura]].
> Xaivanshee currently enjoys the favor of both Zura and Zura's [[Succubus|succubus]] servant [[Liluresha]]; both have imbued her with additional powers.
