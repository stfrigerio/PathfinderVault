> **Tessa Fairwind** is one of the most popular members of the [[Pirate Council]] of the [[Shackles]]. Power-hungry and greedy, she commands one of the largest fleets in the Shackles. She is well known for taking on dangerously reckless raids that seem doomed to failure, yet somehow always snatching victory against all odds. Although widely expected to be the next [[Hurricane King]], she has no wish to take up the title, preferring the freedom of the sea and the thrill of plundering.
> She rules [[Quent]], second largest of the Shackles' ports, and is captain of the [[Ship|sloop]] *[[Luck of the Draw]]*.


## Background

> Tessa was born at sea, to a [[Human|human]] merchant sailor and an [[Elf|elven]] sacred prostitute of the [[Pleasure Salon of Calistria]] in [[Absalom]].
> Tessa's childhood was spent on numerous [[Ship|ships]] and in various ports on the [[Inner Sea]], and she grew up with sea shanties and fabulous tales of adventures. Her career in piracy began when she burgled a smuggler's hidden stash with a [[Yacht|yacht]] stolen in [[Cassomir]]. She captained her first ship at the age of 15, audaciously raiding a [[Thuvia|Thuvian]] pleasure [[Barge|barge]] on the [[Junira]] river. Three years later, to avoid bounty hunters seeking the price on her head, Tessa left the Inner Sea for the [[Arcadian Ocean]]. On the way, she raided [[Cheliax|Chelish]] liners near [[Khari]] and [[Rahadoum|Rahadoumi]] ships and villages before arriving in the Shackles.
> Finding the Shackles to her liking, Tessa began making her name, putting her into conflict with local [[Pirate|pirates]]. Her skulduggery and treachery eventually made her a powerful [[Free Captain]] with a large fleet and the important port city of [[Quent]] under her control.
> In [[4712 AR]], after the [[Hurricane King]] [[Kerdak Bonefist]] was overthrown during an invasion of the [[Chelish Navy]], Tessa Fairwind was chosen to be his replacement.
