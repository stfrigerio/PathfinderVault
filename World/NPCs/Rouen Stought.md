> **Lictor Rouen Stought** leads the [[Order of the Pyre]], [[Hellknights]].
> Born in [[Isger]], Stought lost family to [[Lamashtu|Lamashtan]] cultists. Her parents petitioned for assistance but the local government and church of [[Asmodeus]] attempted to exploit her family, forcing Stought and her family to seek vengeance themselves. Ultimately successful in this endeavor, Stought has ever since been a staunch [[Atheism|atheist]].
