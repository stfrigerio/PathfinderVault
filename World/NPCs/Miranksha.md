> **Miranksha** is a particularly bloodthirsty and patient [[Adhukait|adhukait]] [[Asura|asura]] currently entertaining herself by terrorising pilgrims to the Flowering Jasmine Monastery in [[Jalmeray]]. She finds joy in corrupting faithful individuals, particularly worshippers of[[Good|good]]] [[Deity|deities]].


## Appearance

> Miranksha's rust-coloured bodies are covered in strange holes and many horns.


## Background

> Aeons ago, a cult of [[Diomazul]] was involved in a civil dispute with a nearby cult. When they asked their patron for assistance, Diomazul responded in a disproportionate manner: by slaughtering the other cult to the last, resulting in Miranksha's creation. For millennia, she has assaulted [[Irori|Iroran]] temples and [[Kelesh|Keleshite]] caravans and killed everyone in sight.
> Around [[4415 AR]], Miranksha disappeared and began to meditate on how to become an [[Asura rana|asura rana]]. From her contemplation, she reached the conclusion that she needed to strengthen the connection to an existing rana, and began to draw the attention of [[Vritra]], whose influence has made Miranksha more potent than most of her kind.
> In [[4714 AR]], Miranksha attacked the Flowering Jasmine Monastery, attracted by its reputation and remoteness. All [[Monk|monks]] were slaughtered except their leader Shanaduri, whom she imprisons among the corpses and seeks to corrupt, but Shanaduri's fortitude is wearing Miranksha's patience thin. Meanwhile, she entertains herself by tormenting and killing pilgrims and desecrating the temple, exhuming all corpses, despoiling mantras, making trophies from her kills, and writing an ode in honour of an asura rana. Due to the monastery's remote location, Miranksha's atrocities have been mostly unnoticed.
> When the [[Sarenrae|Sarenite]] priest Xeriban came to the temple, Miranksha began to consider him as her accomplice were he to prove easier to break than Shanaduri.
