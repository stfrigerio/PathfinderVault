> The self-assured [[Pathfinder]] **Arnois Belzig** is [[Eando Kline]]'s rival.  It is he who raced down the [[Sellen River|Sellen]] to report the find of a sleeping serpent city in the [[Darklands]].  He "bested" the hero when he submitted his version of the events and discoveries that Kline wanted to hide from the general public, and other Pathfinders.  After a hearing with the [[Decemvirate]], the Pathfinder leaders decided that Belzig's report would be published, gaining him the notoriety he felt he deserved.


## Appearance

> Belzig is well dressed under even the worst circumstances.  His straight black hair is worn loose to his shoulders.  He maintains a great composure, to the point of being severe.  Kline described his rival in his journal as an "oily haired fop."
