>  **Sigurx** is a troll who has recently separated from a local [[Hobgoblin]] tribe after realizing he was being exploited. The final straw were severe injuries received at the hand of a fire-wielding [[Rules/Classes/Druid]]. Despite just wanting to live in peace, he has been hunted by adventurers hired by the people of [[Purt]] and wanted posters can be found for him in [[Fort Ramgate]].
