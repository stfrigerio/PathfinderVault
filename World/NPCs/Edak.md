**Edak** was a warrior adventurer of no great intelligence yet, nevertheless, formed a friendship with his adventuring companion, the wizard [[Arcil]], who experimented on him with magical ruses to increase Edak's effectiveness in combat. He had a mass of dishevelled hair and wore no armour; he was tall but acted in an ungainly fashion. He was an expert bowman. As well as Arcil, Edak adventured with [[Elyana Sadrastis]], [[Stelan]] and [[Vallyn]]. During a fight with [[Wight|wights]] sent by the [[Gray Gardeners]] of [[Galt]], Edak met his death in a horrible magical accident when Arcil caught him in a powerful fire spell which burnt him to death.
