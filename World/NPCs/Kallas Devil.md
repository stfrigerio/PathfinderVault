> The **Kallas Devil** is a monster dwelling in a partially flooded cave below the bottom of the [[Kallas Lake]] in the [[River Kingdoms]], who terrorises the banks of the [[Sellen River]] from [[Tymon]] to Creeperwood. For the folk of [[Riverton]], the Kallas Devil is an inspiration for both terror and festivals.


## Appearance

> The Kallas Devil looks like a grotesque, skinless [[Humanoid|humanoid]] riding a grotesque, skinless [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]], known as the **Skinned Steed**. Lake water and blood drip off both bodies. Since the Kallas Devil outwardly resembles a [[Nuckelavee|nuckelavee]] with the torso of a [[Sea hag|sea hag]], she is often mistaken as a nuckelavee. In truth, she is a sinew hag, a species of [[Hag|hag]] who flay their victims and wear their skins as clothing, and can fuse their bodies with flayed [[Animal|animals]]. The Kallas Devil can also take the form of a humanoid woman, and can only be distinguished through a faint smell of rotting flesh.


## Associates

> The Kallas Devil is the last remaining member of the Sisters of the River, a coven of powerful sinew hags who claimed various rivers in the River Kingdoms. Despite being in the same coven, the four were too selfish to tolerate each other, and only met once per season to commit acts that required the entire coven. Early in the 4500s, they decided to cooperate, creating an army of flayed animals to attack the petty kingdoms in the River Kingdoms, claim the entire region, and create a locus that would lead to their [[Ascension|ascension]]. However, the River Kingdoms quickly noticed the lack of animals and struck down three of the Sisters of the River. Only one of them escaped and fled to Kallas Lake. Since normally hag covens only include three members, the armies of the River Kingdoms mistakenly believed that their job was accomplished.
> During her time hiding under Kallas Lake, the last surviving sister slowly lost the power she had as part of her coven. She still feels the presence of her sisters and believes that their [[Soul|souls]] might remain trapped in the River Kingdoms. Some villages offer criminals as sacrifices to the Kallas Devil, and although she readily receives these sacrifices, she shows no favour to its supplicants.
