> **Syrranelzon** is a [[White dragon|white dragon]] who lives within an iceberg located near the South Pole of [[Golarion]]. His lair is decorated by more than a hundred creatures frozen by his breath, which he feeds upon in lean times.


## Adlet guards

> A dozen [[Adlet|adlets]], intimidated by Syrranelzon, ferociously guard his lair from intruders. They know that they will be eaten if they fail in their duty, and they wish for Syrranelzon's death, so that they can return to their normal lives.
