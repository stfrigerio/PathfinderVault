 The flying pyramid of Hakotep I
> Pharaoh **Hakotep I** was the ruler of [[OsirionHistory|Ancient Osirion]] who built the [[Slave Trenches of Hakotep]] in the deserts of southwestern [[Osirion]], but is otherwise unknown.



## History


### Ascension & early reign

> Hakotep was the son of [[Djederet I|Pharaoh Djederet I]] and ascended to the throne of Osirion in [[-1653 AR]] upon the death of his father. The young pharaoh was devoted to the dark god [[Set]], but he was intelligent and confident. During his popular reign, Osirion prospered until he chose a dark-eyed beauty of noble blood named [[Neferuset]] as his first royal wife. His advisers spoke against the match because Neferuset, by the age of 16, had already earned a sinister reputation as an [[Oracle|oracle]] of the [[Dark Tapestry]]. Hakotep didn't listen to them and wed Neferuset, vowing to take no other wives during his reign. 


### Conflict with the Shory

> The last decades of Hakotep's reign were tainted by his obsession with the neighboring nation of the [[Shory]] and the increasingly unstable Neferuset's mad obsession for the dark space between the [[Star|stars]] and the strange beings that lived there. Hakotep was convinced that the Shory empire would invade Osirion and ordered the construction of [[Khepsutanem]], now known as the Slave Trenches of Hakotep. It was a powerful weapon that could draw the the Shory's flying cities down from the sky. However, the wars between Osirion and the Shory were ineffectual and cost a great number of Osirian warriors. The only gain was the development of Hakotep's great flying pyramid, a tomb for himself and his queen, and 16 smaller pyramids for his most trusted generals. Pharaoh Hakotep I named himself the Sky Pharaoh ([[Menedes I|Pharaoh Menedes I]], was also known as the Sky Pharaoh).


### Illness & death

> Before the completion of Khepsutanem, Hakotep was afflicted with a recurrent [[Disease|disease]] of astonishing virulence and died in [[-1611 AR]]. His beloved wife took her own life by drinking [[Serpent|serpent]] [[Venom|venom]] and was laid to rest in the massive pyramid which was launched into the skies. With no surviving children, Hakotep was succeeded by his nephew [[Djederet II]] who put great effort to undoing much of his predecessor's legacy.
