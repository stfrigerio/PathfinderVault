> [[Venture-Captain]] **Muesello** is an old but talented mage-machinist working in the [[Pathfinder Society|Pathfinder Societys]] [[Oppara Lodge]]. He crafts extraordinary *[[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Wayfinder|wayfinders]]* for the members of the Society.
> Despite the lodge's connections with both Empress [[Eutropia]] (before her rise to power) and lady [[Gloriana Morilla]], the Pathfinder Society isn't well liked by many Taldan institutions. As a result, Muesello often has struggled to access other academic archives and has been forced to cut political deals for library access on occasion.
