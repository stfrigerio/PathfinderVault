> **Hosetter** was a [[Half-elf|half-elf]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] whose publication, *[[Imperial Betrayal]]*, helped ignite the [[Red Revolution]] of [[Galt]] and the [[People's Revolt|Peoples Revolt]] of [[Andoran]]. After the overthrow of the [[Cheliax|Chelish-backed]] Galtan government in [[4667 AR]], Hosetter, along with fellow philosopher [[Darl Jubannich]], founded an interim government known as the [[Revolutionary Council]], which immediately commissioned the creation of the *[[Nethys/Artifacts/Final Blade|final blades]]*, magical guillotines that could capture the [[Soul|souls]] of the executed. Hosetter himself was ironically executed in his home town of [[Edme]] with one of these *final blades* (named *[[Razor Jenni]]*) several years later after being ousted from the council; his soul still resides within the guillotine.
