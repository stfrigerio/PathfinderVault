> **Kaladurnae** was the first [[Runelord|runelord]] of greed and ruler of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] realm of [[Shalast]]. His reign spanned from [[-6480 AR]] to [[-6448 AR]].


## Accomplishments

> In [[-6478 AR]], Kaladurnae discovered [[Kaer Maga]] as little more than a strange hexagonal structure in modern-day [[Varisia]]. By [[-6470 AR]], Kaer Maga had become the runelord's prison colony.
> Kaladurnae chose the face of [[Mhar Massif]] as the site for [[Xin-Shalast]]. The runelord also invented the official church of Shalast, for which the House of Divine Consumption was the center of its [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and esoteric veneration of greed.


## Relationships

> Kaladurnae had forged a fragile agreement to share literacy and [[Arcane|arcane]] [[Wizard|wizardry]] with [[Kasthezvi|kasthezvis]] in exchange for lore about ancient Kaer Maga. The greed-cursed survivors of these trained kasthezvis are known as [[Runespeaker|runespeakers]].
