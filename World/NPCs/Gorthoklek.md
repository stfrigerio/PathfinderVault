> **General Gorthoklek** is a powerful [[Pit fiend|pit fiend]] who serves [[House Thrune]] in [[Egorian]]. He appeared sometime after the ascension of [[Abrogail Thrune II]] to the throne.
> According to rumor, Abrogail II altered the infernal contract, originally signed by her [[Abrogail I|great-grandmother]], thus calling General Gorthoklek to the [[Material Plane|mortal plane]]. The [[Devil|devil]] serves as an adviser to the queen and an emissary to [[Asmodeus]].
> Those who have been in the court when he is present report that, while in court, Gorthoklek cloaks himself in [[Human|human]] guise, although the aura of [[Evil|evil]] and power emanating him is both overwhelming and unmistakable. Apparently, Abrogail II is herself immune to this power giving rise to theories that she controls the pit fiend; although she takes careful heed of his advice, it is clear that she is the one who controls the direction of Chelish policy. Indeed, it is whispered that the devil reins in her worst impulses.
> Recently, General Gorthoklek fathered a [[Half-fiend|half-fiend]] bastard, named Razorclaw, after a dalliance with a [[Gargoyle|gargoyle]] matriarch. The offspring proved an embarrassment for the pit fiend due to its murderous tendencies, resulting in Gorthoklek sending minions to slay the monster. Although Razorclaw managed to evade the assassination attempt, he was forced to flee into the [[Darklands]].
> The pit fiend shares its name with [[Fort Gorthoklek]], a [[Chelish Navy|Chelish naval]] base in [[Hinji]].
