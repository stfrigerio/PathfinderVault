> **Mierson Berekland** is a friendly middle-aged retired [[Pathfinder]], who owns the [[Gold Falls Inn]] on the northern shore of [[Foam River]] right next to the [[Gold Falls]], in the area of [[Darkmoon Vale]] in [[Andoran]]. Mierson is a descendant of [[Argus Berekland]], the explorer who discovered placer gold at the base of the falls in [[4437 AR]]. Argus built the heavily defended Gold Falls Inn on top of the ruins of a small [[Dwarf|dwarven]] fortress which controlled the wide bridge across the river at the top of the falls. The fort was abandoned and fell into ruin when the bridge collapsed in one of the massive earthquakes during the [[Rending]]. The Berekland family still operates the sluice above the falls built by his ancestor Argus Berekland.
