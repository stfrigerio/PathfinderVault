> **Mandraivus** was a heroic warrior from the realm of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] who is best known for defeating the evil [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] [[Kazavon]] in the 41st century AR.



## Rise of Kazavon

> After Kazavon, in disguise as a [[Human|human]] general, drove the [[Orc|orcs]] out of [[Ustalav]] in [[4043 AR]], he set up his own realm in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. There he constructed the fortress of [[Scarwall]] and began his own reign of terror. Countless armies were sent against the former general but none could defeat him.


## Attack on Scarwall

> Finally in [[4063 AR]], Mandraivus of Lastwall brought together a small cabal of like-minded heroes (including members of the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] [[Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye]]) to defeat a threat that entire armies had failed to bring down. They included Kuiragh a [[Kellid human ethnicity|Kellid]][[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarian]]] prince from the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], a [[Paladin|paladin]] of [[Abadar]] named Roianda, [[Coja Eyes-Aflame]], a [[Shoanti]] shaman from the [[ShoantiSklar-Quah|Sklar-Quah]] tribe, an [[Elf|elven]] [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]] from [[Kyonin]] named Laizuriel, a [[Qadira|Qadiran]] scholar-priest of [[Irori]] named Vahahn, Kolwyddon, a [[Taldor|Taldan]] [[Wizard|wizard]], and a [[Rahadoum|Rahadoumi]] dervish named Kallad. Together they infiltrated the castle with the help of Kazavon's chamberlain, Kleestad. They confronted Kazavon in his throne room and it was only then that they discovered that the heroic Ustalavic general was actually a blue dragon sent by the god [[Zon-Kuthon]]. With the help of the holy sword *[[Nethys/Artifacts/Serithtial]]*, Mandraivus and his allies were able to defeat Kazavon and his minions. Despite their best efforts, the cabal was not able to completely destroy the dragon's body, and Mandraivus decided that each of his allies would take charge of one of the body parts. Mandraivus himself stayed behind with a small group of soldiers to guard Scarwall and make sure evil did not return there.


## Mandraivus' death

> Sadly it was not long before the orcs of the region heard of Kazavon's defeat and stormed the castle. The small group could not organize an effective defense, and despite many orc deaths, they were eventually slain to the last man. Mandraivus was the last to fall against the horde and his spirit became trapped within the castle. After centuries of torment inflicted by the evil spirits dwelling within Scarwall, Mandraivus' spirit went insane and reformed as an undead [[Dread wraith|dread wraith]]. It was eventually destroyed by a group of heroes questing for the sword Serithtial in [[4708 AR]].
