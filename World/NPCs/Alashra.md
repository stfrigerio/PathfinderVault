> **Alashra** is the consort of [[Nathrek the Pale]], and is, in fact, the power behind the throne of the [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]] tribe based at [[Lamashtu's Flower|Lamashtus Flower]] in southern [[Osirion]]. Alashra is a powerful [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Lamashtu]], quite possibly one of her most powerful followers in all of Osirion. Alashra is directly responsible for the success of her gnoll tribe, using her shape-shifting ability to infiltrate nearby [[Eto]]. In Eto, Alashra poses as the merchant queen **Shai-Nefer** and uses her powerful position to lead members of caravans to their deaths in desert ambushes outside of the city.
> Alashra has a daughter from her relationship with Nathrek: [[Najak]], the gnoll leader of the [[Marrow Reavers]] adventuring group.
