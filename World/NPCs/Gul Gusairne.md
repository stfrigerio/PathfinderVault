> **Sir Gul Gusairne** has served as the seneschal for two generations of House Lotheed and also acts as effective head of the Meratt County Secret Police. Sir Gul was the bastard son of a minor cousin of the Lotheed family and an [[Elf|elven]] merchant. He was given absolutely minimal financial support from the family before being shipped off to [[Lotheedar]] for a religious education. A mixture of the harsh treatment by House Lotheed and the lawful stricture of the [[Abadar|Abadaran]] faith has forged a person who allows himself no room for failure and believes even the slightest luxury belongs only to those above him on the social ladder. Despite the harsh treatment he endured at the hands of the Lotheed family, he is unfailingly loyal to them, though he is joyless and pedantic. Sir Gul is loathed by the dispossessed inhabitants of the nearby [[Beggarwood]].
