> **Seldeg Bhedlis** is the most powerful member of the Council Libertine, a group of [[Knights of Ozem]] who infiltrated [[Geb's Rest]] in the late 39th century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]] but were captured, corrupted by [[Geb (person)|Geb]] himself, turned into [[Graveknight|graveknights]] and twisted into stealing the body of [[Arazni]] in order to transform her into a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]]. They now serve Arazni in her search for the *[[Bloodstones of Arazni]]*, her greatest weakness.



## Background

> Bhedlis grew up in a strictly repressive home and looked up to the crusaders of his family and surroundings. He rose quickly through the ranks of the Knights of Ozem and was one of the six knights hand-picked by [[Claidius Barronmor|Master and Commander Claidius Barronmor]] to infiltrate [[Mechitar]] in [[3889 AR]] as the order turned its sights on the [[Undead|undead]] nation.
> Geb was a nation of indulgence, and Bhedlis succumbed to its pleasures while working undercover. He was seduced by a [[Vampire|vampire]] named Ysmett, a secret thrall to the [[Blood Lord]] Hyrune Loxenna, who soon captured Bhedlis and used his guilt from his transgressions and fears of being judged unworthy by [[Aroden]] and [[Pharasma]] to convince him to accept undeath, a transformation that his five companions also soon underwent.
> Geb quickly put Bhedlis and the other corrupted Knights of Ozem, now known as the Council Libertine, to the task of stealing Arazni's body from [[Vigil]], in order for Geb to raise her as a lich now known as the Harlot Queen.
> In [[4719 AR]], when Arazni fled Geb, Bhedlis was tasked to stay behind and keep the news of her disappearance quiet while the other members of the Council Libertine pursue her.


## Appearance

> Bhedlis still wears the charred [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] of the Knights of Ozem, which was fused to his body when Geb incinerated him with [[Magic|magic]]. When presenting to his troops, he wears a black cloak that hides most of it from view.


## Relatives

> Bhedlis was the son of a crusader.


## Associates

> While he remains close with the remaining members of the Council Libertine, Bhedlis views them with growing caution. Although popularly known as Arazni's generals, concubines, and champions, their true purpose is to watch over her on Geb's behalf. Arazni has been mentally conditioned to be unable to raise a hand against any of them.


## Service to Geb

> Bhedlis serves as a spymaster for Geb and operates near [[Yled]]. His primary task is to recover the *Bloodstones of Arazni*, relics made from Arazni's organs that are said to keep Arazni vulnerable while they remain outside of her possession.
