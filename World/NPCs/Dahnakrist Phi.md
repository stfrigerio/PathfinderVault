> **Dahnakrist Phi** serves as the First Speaker of [[Osirion|Osirions]] [[Council of the Sun and Sky]]. Himself a former [[Slavery|slave]], he has incredibly high standing among the common people of [[Sothis]] and the nation as a whole.  The same cannot be said of other political powers, however, and his frequent criticisms of the judiciary has placed him on many a list of enemies.
> His outspokenness may soon cost him his office, and perhaps his life.
