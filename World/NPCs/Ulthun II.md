> Unlike many of the hereditary monarchs that rule other lands, **Watcher-Lord Ulthun II** was chosen for his qualities. He was considered the absolute exemplar of all the [[Crusader|crusader]] virtues [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] values most highly. While his age may seem a disadvantage to his role as [[Watcher-Lord]], his lack of experience is counter-balanced by advisers from groups like the [[Precentors Martial]]. Ulthun's good qualities are numerous: he is pure of heart, faithful to his [[Deity|goddess]], and skilled at arms. He has also displayed a talent for leadership with a quick mind, sound judgement, and a willingness to listen to others. All these qualities, combined with rulership of an entire country, has made Ulthun one of the most eligible bachelors in all [[Avistan]].



## Appearance

> Ulthun is a handsome man, and his features have only improved with age.


## Relatives

> Ulthun is the grandson of refugees who fled the shadowy tyranny of [[Nidal]] in search of a plentiful, peaceful life. Although a romantic man, he has politely refused all suitors seeking his attention.


## Background

> As a child, Ulthun helped other children stand up to bullies on the streets of [[Vigil]], and later went on many tours of service in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. He was appointed Watcher-Lord in [[4709 AR]] at the age of 19, the youngest leader Lastwall has ever seen; by that time, he already established a reputation of piety and courage. His leadership has further solidified his reputation, as he improved foreign relations, vigorously defended the Belkzen frontier, and selflessly dedicated himself to the glory of his nation and goddess.
> In [[4719 AR]], Ulthun saw destruction on a scale he could never have imagined as the city of Vigil was destroyed and thousands of civilians were killed by the *Radiant Fire*. Discovering that [[Tar-Baphon]], the ancient enemy of the [[Knights of Ozem]], had just escaped from his prison of [[Gallowspire]] and was responsible for the calamity, and that [[Arazni]], his order's shame, was also somehow involved, he led the surviving Knights of Ozem on a death march upon [[Renchurch]] to deliver justice to both [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|liches]]. He was dissuaded from wasting his men's lives in an unwinnable battle by a group of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] working with Arazni, and with the aid of the [[Goblin|goblin]] [[Crookedtoes|Crookedtoes tribe]] of the [[Fangwood 1]], he managed to cut off the [[Undead|undead]] army pursuing him and evacuate to [[Absalom]].
> Ulthun has made considerable waves in Absalom where he struggles to gain support from the rich and powerful for his cause in reclaiming his lost homeland. He has also supported the rebuilding of Absalom’s long‑destroyed [[Precipice Quarter]] so that it may serve as a sanctuary for refugees.
