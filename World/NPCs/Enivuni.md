> **Enivuni** was the leader of the [[Fungus queen|fungus queens]] and the cult of [[Cyth-V'sug|Cyth-Vsug]] in the [[Demon|demon-controlled]] realm of the [[Worldwound]]. Enivuni was one of the first of her kind, created from one of the weakest [[Succubus|succubi]] who dared attack the [[Witch|witch]] Soris Delyn. The high priestess wished to eventually convert all the demons of the Worldwound into her minions. Since the closing of the Worldwound at the end of the [[Fifth Mendevian Crusade]] in [[4718 AR]], her current fate remains unknown.
