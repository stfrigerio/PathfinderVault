> **Titus Scarnetti** is the head of the noble [[House Scarnetti|Scarnetti family]] in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of [[Sandpoint]]. He controls all of Sandpoint's mills and lumber yards, and is therefore one of the most powerful people on the [[Lost Coast]]. Nobleman Scarnetti is quite conservative and traditional in his thinking, which often puts him at odds with the other people in town. This disconnect has cost him the race for mayor every time he has run against the more likeable [[Kendra Deverin]], and there is no love lost between the two. Lately, there have been rumors that Titus has links to certain nefarious individuals in the Sandpoint area—including members of the [[Sczarni|Sczarni criminal gangs]]—which have greatly reduced his standing in town.


## Relatives

> Titus is the only surviving son of Alamon Scarnetti, who assaulted the local [[Varisian|Varisians]] more than 40 years ago but was not punished for this crime. Titus is married to Delarah and has three children: a daughter named Elisse, and two sons named Charn and Lianel. His aunt Enid and her son Adimar originally lived in [[Riddleport]], but have since been forced to flee to Titus' residence in Sandpoint to avoid reprisal.
