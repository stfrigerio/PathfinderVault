> **Baron Grallus** was the ruler of the remote [[Cheliax|Chelish]] colony of [[Sargava]] at the time of the death of [[Aroden]]. He was born in [[4577 AR]] to Baroness Elexa of [[House Davian]], and in the subsequent civil war in Cheliax he backed their bid for the throne, funding them using the colony's treasury.
> Unfortunately for him, [[House Thrune]] defeated House Davian and gained control of Cheliax. In [[4643 AR]] House Thrune felt sufficiently established to be able to send a Chelish fleet to punish Sargava for supporting its rival.
> Baron Grallus turned to the [[Shackles Pirates]] for aid. In return for the rest of the Sargavan treasury, they engaged the Chelish fleet and sunk them in [[Desperation Bay]]. The Baron agreed to pay them an ongoing stipend for protection from Cheliax, which still continues.
> The Baron died in [[4662 AR]], and was succeeded by Baron [[Utilinus]].
> The opulent [[Grallus Ball]] was once a feature of the social scene in [[Anthusis|Eleder]], until the worsening financial situation put paid to such extravagances.
