> **Jediah Kheln** is a [[Ghoul|ghoul]] living in [[Paupers' Graves|Paupers Graves]], a graveyard about three miles east of [[Sandpoint]].


## History

> Kheln is originally from [[Magnimar]], but fled town for Sandpoint after losing all his wealth to treacherous family members and being involved in a theft gone bad. He slept in alleyways while trying to avoid the notice of investigators from Magnimar. While in these desperate straights, he was approached by a mysterious stranger with a proposition to steal a silver medallion from a secret compartment in a statue in Pauper's Graves. Kheln did as the stranger indicated, but was betrayed, as the stranger was [[Kanker]], a ghoul priest of [[Kabriri]]. The medallion conferred protection over the graveyard, but was rendered powerless by the theft.
> Kheln was infected with [[Ghoul fever|ghoul fever]], died several days later in Sandpoint, and rose as a ghoul. He has made Paupers' Graves his home for the past several years. He has infected others, turning them into ghouls and worked with Kanker to alchemically transform [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|dogs]] into [[Ghoul hound|ghoul hounds]].
