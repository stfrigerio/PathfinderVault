> **Venster Arabasti** was the bastard child of [[Domina Arabasti|Queen Domina]] of [[Korvosa]]. Because of his otherworldly parentage, Venster was hidden away by his family on the fourth floor of [[Castle Korvosa]], where he lived as a recluse. His only contacts with anyone, were his occasional card games and [[Harrow|harrow]] readings he shared with his half-brother [[Eodred Arabasti II|Eodred]]. Despite these pleasantries, Venster was very jealous of his half-brother, and it took little for his brother's wife, [[Ileosa Arabasti|Ileosa]], to seduce Venster and then convince him to murder the King. He [[Poison|poisoned]] the playing cards he and his brother used during their visits, a poison which the King would eventually succumb to in [[4708 AR]].
> After she had no further use for him, Queen Ileosa killed Venster by walling him into a room in the castle's dungeons and letting him die of thirst. Due to the trauma surrounding his death and his powerful guilt associated with the killing of his half-brother, Venster's spirit could not rest, and he returned to haunt Castle Korvosa. He was eventually able to find peace due to the actions of a small group who brought the reign of terror of Queen Ileosa to an end.
