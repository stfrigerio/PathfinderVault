> **Terokar** is an ancient [[Cyclops|cyclops]] [[Necromancer|necromancer]] who dwells deep beneath the towering [[Fog Peaks]] in eastern [[Galt]]. He was exiled from his tribe because of his foul [[Necromancy|necromantic]] rituals. Eventually he took his own life in a ritual to become a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]]. He then sought vengeance on his old tribe, and wiped out his people using his vile arcana and [[Undead|undead]] cyclops soldiers. Now, Terokar is planning a campaign that spans the southeastern reaches of the Fog Peaks and into [[Taldor]] in order to establish an empire resembling that of his long-dead ancestors.
