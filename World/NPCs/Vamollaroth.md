> **Vamollaroth** is known to the [[Elf|elves]] of [[Kyonin]] as the **Rancorous Wrath**, and is a follower of the [[Nascent demon lord|nascent demon lord]] [[Treerazer]]. A [[Hezrou|hezrou]] of gargantuan proportions, Vamollaroth is perhaps the largest [[Demon|demon]] in all the [[Tanglebriar]] (including Treerazer). Vamollaroth spends most of the time submerged in the anthracite-black waters of the tarn surrounding the fortress of the [[Witchbole]]. He emerges several times a year upon his master's command to lay waste to anything in his path. He is capable of vomiting forth an incredible amount of foul pollutants and [[Toxin|toxins]] that increases the reach and corruption of the Tanglebriar by several hundred feet.


## Summoning Vamollaroth

> Although it is theoretically possible to [[Magic/Conjuration|summon]] Vamollaroth using a *[[Greater planar ally|greater planar ally]]* or *[[Greater planar binding|greater planar binding]]* [[Spell|spell]], it is incredibly difficult. It is rumored that the hezrou would require an astounding amount of [[Poison|poisonous]] elixirs to perform a task for the caster.
