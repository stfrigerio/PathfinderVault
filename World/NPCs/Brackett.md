> **Venture-Captain Brackett** is the founder and current leader of the [[Pathfinder Society|Pathfinder Societys]] [[Almas Lodge|lodge]] in the [[Andoran|Andoren]] capital of [[Almas]].


## Description

> Brackett is middle-aged and has a distinctive hawk nose. Like many venture-captains, he appears brash and outgoing, and is known for his skill with a blade. Ever the gregarious and gracious host, Brackett holds bimonthly gatherings for [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] and his many "friends" in Almas. These epic events help to maintain his popularity with the community at large. Brackett is a careful planner; he is the architect who completely redesigned the interior of the cathedral to create spaces for broad Pathfinder Society uses, including large meetings, accommodations, a grand library second only to the [[Grand Lodge|Grand Lodges]], a [[Laboratory|laboratory]], and an underground reliquary. He uses the cathedral bells to send messages to his agents.


## History

> Brackett established the lodge when he purchased and converted a largely abandoned cathedral to [[Aroden]] in Almas' [[East Hill]] neighborhood. He became its first (and so far only) [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]], and lives in the largest of the cathedral's many fine rooms. Brackett was nearly killed in [[4711 AR]], when the traitorous [[People's Council|Councilwoman]] [[Dorianna Ouidda]] seized the lodge with the help of her [[Shadow Lodge]] allies. He and the other hostages (who included the [[Amenopheus|Sapphire Sage Amenopheus]]) were eventually freed thanks to the timely intervention of other Pathfinder agents.
