> The **Brothers Treyes** were two brothers—**Liron Treyes** and **Cadamon Treyes**—who are most famous for making an investigation into the ancient [[Kellid]] mound called [[Kalexcourt]] in [[Vieland]], [[Ustalav]]. The brothers' investigation found many items there, and they founded the [[University of Lepidstadt]] to contain these artefacts. To this day the Treyes Museum of Antiquities is a major part of the university. The Brothers were also the first to investigate the [[Spiral Cromlech]] in [[Lepidstadt]].
> In addition to their exploration, the Brothers Treyes were also authors and wrote, for instance, [[List of written works|A Treasury of Varisian Tales]] and *Liron Treyes' Journal*.
