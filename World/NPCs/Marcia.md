> **Baroness Marcia** is the [[Jadwiga]] ruler of the peasant town [[Trezira]] on the [[Frozen Road River]] in the eastern part of [[Irrisen|Irrisens]] [[Bleakmarch]] province. She is not very oppressive to the peasants provided they fulfill the terms of their charter, and do not endanger the town's lucrative "ice cleaving" monopoly.
