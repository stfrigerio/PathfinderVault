> **Ordrik Talhrik** was [[Garbold Talhrik|King Garbold Talhriks]] cousin and closest advisor but also a [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Droskar]]. He was controlling his cousin with [[Drugs|addictive substances]] and making him cede more and more power to the priests of Droskar. Ordrik murdered his cousin and seized the throne of the [[Five Kings Mountains]] kingdom in [[4369 AR]] and attempted to create a theocracy. The resulting [[Forge War]] raged for 13 years. Generals loyal to the true crown fought to keep their kingdom but they failed and, in [[4382 AR]], Ordrik declared himself theocrat and all [[Dwarves|dwarves]] had to work in Droskar's name. For nearly 100 years the dwarves of the Five Kings Mountains lost every sense of [[Art|art]] and beauty and their craftsmanship became merely adequate. Many dwarves fled to the other dwarven kingdoms, as well as settlements in [[Druma]] and the [[Mindspin Mountains]]. In the end, priests could not maintain their hold on the other dwarves and Ordrik's theocracy crumbled in [[4466 AR]].
> During the Forge War the legendary *[[Axe of the Dwarvish Lords]]* was claimed by Theocrat Ordrik. Knowing the threat to his rising regime that the axe represented, Theocrat Ordrik hid it away deep beneath [[Droskar's Crag|Droskars Crag]].
