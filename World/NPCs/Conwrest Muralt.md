> **Count Conwrest Muralt** is somewhat of a anomaly amongst [[Ustalav|Ustalavs]] nobility as he is a noble in title only. He was adopted by the former count of [[Odranto]], [[Manfray Muralt|Count Manfray Muralt]], and since he was Manfray's only male child adopted or otherwise, Conwrest eventually inherited the throne. Shortly after gaining power and possibly to further legitimise his rule, Conwrest married his sister by adoption, Lyrabella. His rule has been tumultuous for the people of Odranto, with Count Conwrest often making contradictory proclamations and suffering from incredibly swift mood swings.
