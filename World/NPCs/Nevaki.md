> **Nevaki** is an ancient [[Harpy|harpy]] crone. She once lived in the [[Zho Mountains]] in [[Qadira]], but was exiled from there a long time ago. She now lives in the [[Darklands]] region known as the [[Endless Gulf]], where she rules over a large colony of [[Dire corby|dire corbies]].
> She has several daughters from dire corby sires: these deformed creatures have no wings, but retain their mother's dangerous song ability.
> Nevaki hates the [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]], and dreams of the day she will launch her followers against them. However, her slothful nature means that day is a long way off.
