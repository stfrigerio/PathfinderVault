> **Rogard Hammerfell** is the current leader of the [[Duskwarden|Duskwardens]], a group of vigilant guards who patrol the miles of tunnels beneath the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]], and lead travelers along the [[Halflight Path]] into and out of the city.
> Rogard is a canny veteran of many underground battles, and is selfless in the protection of his wardens. He expects the Duskwardens to live up to his own high standards, but is not afraid to get his hands dirty. Such virtue and expertise has seen an increase in the membership of the Duskwardens under his tenure.
