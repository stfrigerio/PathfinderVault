> **Eurad Dberryl** was one of the dwarven Generals, loyal to king [[Garbold Talhrik]], who fought [[Ordrik Talhrik]] when he murdered Garbold and seized the throne of the [[Five Kings Mountains]] kingdom in [[4369 AR]]. The legendary [[Axe of the Dwarvish Lords]], which had been lost during the chaos of the [[Five Kings Wars]], was found in the hands of Eurad but was claimed by Theocrat Ordrik's followers during the [[Forge War]]. The Generals failed to stop Ordrik which declared himself theocrat in [[4382 AR]].
