> **Uvaglor** is a [[Vrock|vrock]], the spawn of [[Lamashtu]] and [[Pazuzu]], who possesses a third eye capable of seeing the future.


## Background

> Uvaglor was born during the [[Age of Creation]] shortly after his parents first met and went to [[Golarion]] to mate. He spent an unnaturally short time in his mother's womb, created the [[Rasp]] as he was born, and was abandoned by his parents when they returned to the [[Abyss]]. Lamashtu and Pazuzu soon became arch-enemies, and both of their cults deny Uvaglor's existence out of terrible shame.
> In the [[Age of Anguish]], Uvaglor emerged from the [[Pit Sandpoint hinterlands|Pit]] to [[Slavery|enslave]] the local [[Varisian|Varisians]], who had just recovered from [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] slavery and [[Earthfall]]. The Varisians asked Lamashtu for help, but her minions only aided them for a short while before betraying them as well. Eventually, both Uvaglor and Lamashtu's servants were defeated by Sazzleru, a priestess of [[Ashava]]. Uvaglor was banished to a prison in the [[Maelstrom]], and Sazzleru left behind a ward to contain the Abyssal infection in the Pit that could only be undone by powerful non-[[Evil|evil]] [[Mortal|mortals]].


## Current plans

> Eventually, Uvaglor escaped from his prison and returned to the Abyss to gather power. He then turned his attention toward his birthplace and appointed several agents, led by the [[Red Bishop]], to the [[Lost Coast]]. The Red Bishop seeks to attract heroes to the area and asks them for their help in destroying Sazzleru's ward so that the Pit can be connected to Uvaglor's realm in the Abyss, unleashing him upon Golarion.
