> **Scivia Zyrendox**, an old [[Drow|drow]] ally of [[Magma dragon|magma dragon]] [[Moschabbatt]] from his days in [[Sekamina]], was once his lover and now his closest advisor. She is one of the few living creatures who know definitely that the dragon holds the *[[Axe of the Dwarvish Lords]]*. She spends most of her time studying metallurgy and geology. Outside the door of her library is the petrified corpse of [[Bravitsor Broac]].
