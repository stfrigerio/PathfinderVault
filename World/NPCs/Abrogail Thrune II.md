*This article covers the monarch of [[Cheliax]]. For the satirical play, see [[Abrogail II]].*
> **Her Infernal Majestrix, Queen Abrogail II of the Thrice-Damned House of Thrune** is the sixth ruler to wear the crown of the [[Diabolism|diabolical]] nation since her great-grandmother [[Abrogail Thrune I]] took control of the warring noble houses in [[4640 AR]]. As a young monarch, she receives advice from her [[Pit fiend|pit fiend]] courtier, [[Gorthoklek]], who also served her great-grandmother. [[Asmodeus]] himself provided an [[Erinys|erinys]] named [[Lrilatha|Contessa Lrilatha]] to serve as the young queen's instructor.

 
 Her Infernal Majestrix, Queen Abrogail II, with [[Lrilatha|Contessa Lrilatha]] and [[Gorthoklek|General Gorthoklek]], her most trusted advisers.
> Beautiful and ruthless (in addition to being a powerful [[Sorcerer|sorceress]]), Abrogail makes a strong leader for Cheliax. According to rumour, Abrogail is an immature, demanding, and spoilt ruler, but she has nevertheless proven herself to be a vicious fighter on the political scene. Ironically, whispers say that her fiendish advisers rein in her darker impulses. What is certain is that her quick wit and daring schemes can only help Cheliax regain some of its lost imperial glory in the years to come.
