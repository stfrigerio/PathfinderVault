> **Grand Prince Adavarine II** was the emperor of [[Taldor]] who signed the [[Treaty of the Wildwood]] in [[3841 AR]], which ceded control of the [[Verduran Province]] to the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of the [[Wildwood Lodge]] in exchange for their control of the forest's more dangerous and unusual denizens.
> Part of the reason for the Emperor's agreement was that the increasingly violent fey raids made harvesting Blackwood trees from the forest increasingly dangerous. This timber was vital to strengthen Taldor's navy after several substantial losses were suffered from the nation's war with the Pirate Queens of Zevady
