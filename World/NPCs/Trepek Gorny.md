> **Trepek Gorny** is the leader of the most respected and successful "ice cleaving" company of small [[Irrisen]] town [[Trezira]], called the [[White Stewards]]. Trepek is a laconic man who lost his twin sons in [[4713 AR]] in a ice cleaving run 20 miles west of [[Chillblight]]. The other six companies that are involved in the ice cleaving business are trying to exploit Trepek's mourning, spreading rumors that Trepek's sympathies lie with the town of [[Atvan]], which has long coveted Trezira's lucrative monopoly.
