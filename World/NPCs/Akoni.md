>  **Akoni** is a male [[Dryad]] who lives in [[Tickwood]] near [[Sandpoint]]. He controls [[Akoni's Grove]], where he presides over the other [[Fey]] that live in the forest.


## Relations with civilization

>  Akoni's main engagement with the town came when his love Ovana Scarnetti died. This led to him brokering a loose deal with Grustmier, a [[Redcap]] who is looking to take over the grove. A party led by [[Shalelu Andosana]] and including [[Harsk]], Daviren Hosk, [[Lanalee Magravi]], and Trenk Luzlor went to see what had riled the fey. They stumbled into the grove and were chased off. The redcaps then attacked Ovana's funeral to collect her body, fighting Harsk and [[Lini]]. These heroes eventually bought Ovana's body back to the grove and Akoni.


## Relations with other fey

>  Akoni is the leader of the fey in Tickwood. He has [[sprites]] and [[grigs]] in his court. A family of redcaps are trying to take over the court, and are actively poisoning the redwood tree Akoni is bound to.
