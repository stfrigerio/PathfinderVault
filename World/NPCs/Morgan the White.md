> **Morgan the White** was a pirate from [[Cheliax]] who dreamt of "retiring" to a small patch of land somewhere, bringing along a number of like-minded individuals, and extorting passing water-traffic.
> The plan required a region without a powerful navy, and Morgan eventually realised that the [[River Kingdoms]] were an ideal location. He called upon all of his pirate allies and contacts to join him and established a Protectorate on the banks of the [[Sellen River]]. Hundreds of other pirates came to join him, and his protection racket on the river became known as the [[Pirate Pact]].
> Morgan attended the [[Outlaw Council]] and promised to abide by the [[River Freedoms]]. As a result, his new Protectorate became an accepted part of the River Kingdoms.
> Morgan styled himself the White Marquis, and his realm was known as the Protectorate of the White Marquis. He was killed in [[4702 AR]] by one of his erstwhile allies, who took control of the Protectorate and dubbed himself the [[Crimson Marquis]].
> There have been a number of violent regime changes in the brief number of years since Morgan's death, but the current inheritor of Morgan's dream is [[Urdal Bazzak]]. He has taken the title of Black Marquis, so the region is currently known as the [[Protectorate of the Black Marquis]].
