> The **Emissary from Beyond** is a [[Vespergaunt|vespergaunt]] who serves the [[Dominion of the Black]]. When [[Gelviel Zorriah]] used the *[[Orrery of distant worlds|orrery of distant worlds]]* to make contact with distant beings, the Emissary sent him visions impersonating [[Desna]] to inspire Gelviel to create a [[Spaceship|spaceship]], which Gelviel named the *[[Lirgen's Glory|Lirgens Glory]]*.
> In [[4656 AR]], [[4600 AR|56 years]] after the *Lirgen's Glory* left [[Golarion]], the Emissary intercepted the spaceship, revealed itself as the source of Gelviel's visions, and hijacked the ship by corrupting the crew's [[Dream crystal|dream crystals]]. Its goal: to return to Golarion and prepare it for the Dominion.
