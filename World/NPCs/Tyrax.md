*For another meaning of "Tyrax", please see [[Tyraxalan]].*
> **Tyrax "Blood Bones"** was a notorious pirate king who established a stronghold on [[Mosquito Island]], just north-east of [[Mediogalti]]. Legend has it that his treasure was buried somewhere on Mosquito Island. The island is now claimed by the [[Red Mantis|Red Mantis assassins]], and anyone searching for the treasure would have to evade their regular patrols who kill intruders on sight.
