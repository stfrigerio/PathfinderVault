> The slaver **Captain Ilmatis Okeno** declared herself the first lord of the port of [[Okeno]] in [[3496 AR]]. Okeno originally began as a convenient spot for [[Pirate|pirates]] to stop by to collect water and provisions without relying on the ports of the mainland nations. Captain Okeno encouraged other pirates to trade slavers there creating a convenient center for their business. The empires of [[Taldor]] and [[Cheliax]] required large number of slaves and Okeno provided a consistent supply. Captain Okeno ruled the port city for over a decade but she was killed when she tried to unite the slavers under her flag. For 300 years after her death, Okeno continued to serve as a pirate port without centralized leadership, despite various attempts to unify the pirates under a single banner.
