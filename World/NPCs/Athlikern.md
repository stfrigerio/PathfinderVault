> **Athlikern** serves as the high priest of the [[House of the Infinite Strata]] in the [[Djinni|djinni]] city of [[Armun Kelisk]]. Athlikern is a devotee of the [[Deity|god]] [[Gozreh]] and the House of the Infinite Strata is the largest, most impressive temple devoted to Gozreh in the entire city. It is notable that, as one of the most prominent religious figure in Armun Kelisk, capital of the [[Djinni Empire]], Athlikern himself is not a djinni but a [[Sylph|sylph]].
