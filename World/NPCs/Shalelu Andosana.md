> **Shalelu Andosana** (pronounced sha-LEE-luu) is an [[Elf|elven]] warrior who makes her home in the wilds of central and western [[Varisia]].


## Background

> Shalelu was born in a small village called [[Crying Leaf]], and lost her father when she was very young to the attack of a [[Bugbear|bugbear]] [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|assassin]]. Her mother, Seanthia, remained unmarried for nearly a hundred years until she took a [[Human|human]] mercenary, Jakardos, as a second husband. This choice scandalized the community at Crying Leaf, but Shalelu treated him as a father. After Seanthia was killed when a [[Green dragon|green dragon]] attacked their hometown, however, Jakardos left both Crying Leaf and Shalelu out of heartbreak and did not return. This left Shalelu questioning the nature of her mother's and stepfather's relationship, and wondering if Jakardos had been taking advantage of Seanthia. This abandonment left a deep impression on Shalelu, who entered a period of depression and she eventually left Crying Lead to adopt a solitary lifestyle as a [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|ranger]] and bounty hunter.
> Shalelu eventually settled in the wilds around [[Sandpoint]], which was at the time only beginning to establish itself. Shalelu took the village under her wing and protected it from [[Goblin|goblins]], bugbears, [[Ghoul|ghouls]], and worse. She did not settle in Sandpoint itself, however, occasionally passing through the town for supplies but rarely staying long. She developed a strong enmity with the [[Goblinoid|goblinoids]] of the local hinterlands, and spent several years fighting against the local goblin tribes. She developed a particularly personal enmity with the bugbear [[Bruthazmus]], whom she fought on several occasions.
> While watching over Sandpoint, Shalelu developed a close friendship with [[Ameiko Kaijitsu]], coming to see her as a younger sister and seeing a reflection of her own history in the tragedies that befell Ameiko. On those occasions where she stays in Sandpoint overnight, she typically spends the night in Ameiko's tavern, the [[Rusty Dragon]].
> During this period, Shalelu was able to resolve some of the issues haunting her since infancy. She managed to track down Jakardos, who had settled in central Varisia, reconciling with him and coming to terms with the death of her mother. Later on, having returned to Crying Leaf to help the local elves with dealing with increased [[Drow|drow]] activity in the [[Mierani Forest]], she was able to help kill the green dragon that slew her mother.
> In recent years, Sandpoint's growing militia has begun to lessen the need of Shalelu's guardianship over the town, something that Shalelu found pleasing and a sign of the town beginning to mature. Relieved of her pressures from her family history and her responsibilities over Sandpoint, Shalelu is beginning to experience a deep wanderlust and the need to make a long journey away from her usual haunts.


## Relationships

> Shalelu informs on threats around [[Magnimar]] to [[Sheila Heidmarch|Sheila]] and [[Canayven Heidmarch]] and helps lead expeditions out of their [[Heidmarch Manor|Pathfinder lodge]]. In exchange, she receives goods that she otherwise is unable to acquire on her own.
