> **Aligois Thels** was a brilliant veteran of the navy of [[Cheliax]] and one of the first two dozen [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]] in the group organized by [[Daidian Ruel]]. When Ruel disappeared in [[Calistril]], [[4589 AR]], Thels became the new leader of the group. His vision was that the Hellknights would eventually replace the military of Cheliax which was dominated by the nobility. He added the ranks and organization found in current Hellknight orders, basing them upon the ancient legions of [[Jistka Imperium|Jistka]]. In [[4609 AR]] he reorganized the Hellknights once again and created five new orders which were each capable of independent action. He retained control of the [[Order of the Scourge]] and served as its Lictor until his death in [[4629 AR]] of natural causes.
