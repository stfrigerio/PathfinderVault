> **Dominicus Rell**, officially, is a close advisor of the [[Grand Prince]] of [[Taldor]], but also heads the [[Lion Blades]] hidden [[Shadow Schools]]. An imposing man of [[Azlant|Azlanti]] ancestry, the cold stare of his multi-colored eyes has been known to freeze people in their tracks. He also trains the [[Ulfen Guard]] in Shadow School techniques. Dominicus Rell spends his time between the [[Imperial Palace]], the halls of the bureaucracy, and the Shadow Schools. He seems to believe that the most important thing for the good of the empire is to keep the Grand Prince in power and so his personal efforts seem to go towards strengthening [[Stavian III|Stavian IIIs]] position. Of course, this goes in parallel with an ever increasing dependence of the Grand Prince on Rell himself.
> Initially, Rell considered Princess [[Eutropia]] naive and in danger of creating instability in Taldor but has since become one of her most loyal advisors upon her ascension to the throne. Rumours within the Lion's Blades suggest a growing divide in agent loyalty however, favouring a senior agent named Laurisa Tromaine over Rell.
> Rell is often found in the [[Kitharodian Academy]] training recruits or enhancing the collections of the secret Library of the Lion located there.
> The *[[Cubes of Nex|abjuration cube of Nex]]* is currently in the possession of Dominicus Rell. Rell's personal resistance to [[Scrying|scrying]] was strong. The [[Council of Three and Nine]] managed to locate the *cube* and identify its owner only after twelve years of searching. The Council believes that Rell uses the *cube* for assassinating powerful [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]], dispelling their defenses as he goes in for the kill.
