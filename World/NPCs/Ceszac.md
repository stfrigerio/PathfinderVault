> The [[Frost giant|frost giant]] **Jarl Ceszac** marched alongside [[Baba Yaga]] during the [[Winter War]], commanding a legion of frost giants and young [[White dragon|white dragons]]. When the war ended, Ceszac was dissatisfied with his rewards and complained loudly that he should be the first among Baba Yaga's allies. She grew weary of his complaints and presented him the mighty fortress of [[Frost Giant's Fist|Frost Giants Fist]] as a gift. The fortress even contained a throne built of solid gold in its royal hall. The jarl still complained and the Witch-Mother frustratedly [[Curses of Golarion|cursed]] the [[Giant|giant]] saying he would live forever in his new keep. The jarl is trapped in the keep since then, guarding his hoard and venting his undying rage on any who try to steal his gold.
