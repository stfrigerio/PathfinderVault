> **Arantaros** is an [[Undead|undead]] [[Ravener|ravener]] who dwells in the [[Barrier Wall]] in northern [[Garund]] terrorizing those who live locally. In life, Arantaros was a [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] with a scholarly bent. He delved into esoteric studies of [[Necromancy|necromancy]] and [[Alchemy|alchemy]]. Impressed by his studies, the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Haagenti]] gave Arantaros the "gift" of undead immortality, so that he would be able to continue his work.
