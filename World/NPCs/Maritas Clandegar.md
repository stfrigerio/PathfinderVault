> **Maritas Clandegar** is the [[Hellknight ranks|Lictor]] of the [[Order of the Glyph]], an unofficial [[Hellknights]] order created by [[House Thrune]] to protect the real history of [[Cheliax]] that has been 'reinterpreted' by the Thrunes. He resides in a *mage's magnificent mansion* accessible via a [[Portal|portal]] from his throne room in the Archive of Redacted Histories. A stern, introverted man, he enjoys studying the books in the archive, and learning secrets that few know. Although his order is nominally allied with House Thrune, they follow their own code and would never agree to destroy the documents under their charge under any circumstances. Lictor Clandegar suspects that one day House Thrune will regret creating the Order of the Glyph.
