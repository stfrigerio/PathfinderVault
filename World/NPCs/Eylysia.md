> **Eylysia** is a founding member of the [[Pathfinder Society]], and witnessed the first century of its development — while also seeking to rein in its most dangerous practices, and later its systemic corruption — before being accused of assassinating a member of its leadership, the [[Decemvirate]], and going into hiding.



## Appearance

> Eylysia is a [[Gnome|gnome]] woman with feathered, pale teal hair, long pointed eyebrows that extend far past the sides of her face, tanned skin, and blue tattoo-like markings.


## Associates

> Eylysia was a known associate of the nine founding Pathfinders, alongside [[Durvin Gest]], [[Gregaro Voth]], [[Inali Buvgram]], [[Kerinha Napsunar]], [[Noyta Gleddirow]], [[Selmius Foster]], [[Adolphus]], and [[Toriah al-Myran]]. Foster long held suspicions of Eylysia, particularly that her published output had been nearly one-third of his despite undertaking a similar number of expeditions, and he and his assistant Adolphus recorded various observations of her in their journals.
> She was also an acquaintance or friend of:

> - Arkath the Stonemason
> - Avera, an [[Elf|elven]] [[Rogue|rogue]]
> - Fimbrik, a [[Gnome|gnome]] [[Illusionist|illusionist]] of the [[Arcanamirium]]
> - Idina Gray, a [[Half-elf|half-elven]] [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarian]]

## Background


### Founding the Pathfinder Society

> Eylysia was one of the nine known [[Adventurer|adventurers]] present at the [[Pig's Paunch|Pigs Paunch]] in [[Absalom]] on 23 [[Desnus]], [[4307 AR]], when discussions of their work led to the formation of a group that, by the end of a drunken pub crawl across the city ending at the [[Wounded Wisp]] tavern, would call itself the Pathfinder Society.
> In the decade following that night, Eylysia repeatedly traversed the [[Inner Sea]] to witness and record events of historical importance for publication in affiliation with the Society.
> In [[4321 AR]], she joined [[Gregaro Voth]] and [[Noyta Gleddirow]] as members of the Society's first [[Decemvirate]].
> During her tenure, she debated the Society's tendency to publish potentially harmful information as part of its mission to report its findings. Unable to bring herself to destroy such information, she hid the secrets in many places, particularly in hidden troves across [[Absalom]].


### Dispute and disappearance

> A violent internal coup in [[4411 AR]] led to the Decemvirate retiring and its successors adopting masks for anonymity. Despite the secrecy, Eylysia was familiar enough with the Society's membership to identify some of the new members of the Decemvirate as having appalling records of malfeasance and deceit, attempted to confront three of them with evidence, and instead fought and killed one of them before fleeing.
> The accused Decemvirate reframed the incident as an assassination attempt, the truth of which was not contested until [[Kreighton Shaine]] came into possession of her notes of the incident. Before those revelations, the Decemvirate took a bounty out for her capture, and she subsequently disappeared into hiding, where she remained for more than five centuries.


### Discovery and re-emergence

> In [[4719 AR]], she was located by the Society in hiding on [[Red Mantis]]-controlled [[Mediogalti]]. During the intervening centuries, she covertly worked with [[Grandmaster Torch]] to deduce the identities of all of the Decemvirate's members.
> Her return confirmed some persistent mysteries about the Society, such as revealing the treachery of [[Vahlo Huovar]] and confirming the roles of the [[Wounded Wisp]] and [[Pig's Paunch|Pigs Paunch]] taverns in the Society's founding, and also helped the Society form new factions that refocused its mission on [[Archaeology|archaeology]] and exploration.


### Hidden findings

> Eylysia was rumored to have discovered or explored numerous locations that went without reporting, or had hidden notes from others' findings to prevent their publication. She encoded some of her hidden findings in a cypher, and obscured them by writing them in an obscure [[Azlant|Azlanti]] dialect. Some of the recovered findings include:

> - Caches of documents hidden in several locations across Absalom.
> - [[Gojan the Sharp]]'s findings from [[Sulfur Gulch]], in the [[Sellen Hills]] of [[Numeria]].
> - An unnamed colleague's collected stories of Kolvi, an aspirational [[Linnorm King|linnorm king]] from Frostbreach in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], who was accused of being an [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] [[Witch|witch]] and executed.
> - A "speaking artifact", likely of [[Shoanti]] origin, witnessed by [[Montlarion Jeggare]].
> - *Autumn's Cowl*, a headpiece supposedly discovered in [[Arthfell Forest]] by Zaul Blystone.
> - An ambiguous "old noble's tale" connected to the Rising Spire in [[Highhelm Militia]].
