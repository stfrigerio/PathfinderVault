> **Lictor Resarc Ountor** serves as leader of the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Godclaw]].
> Ountor has long cleaved to teachings of the [[Godclaw]] but was once a servant of [[Abadar]] alone. Militant beyond most Abadarans, Ountor fervently believes his order has the blessing of five [[Deity|deities]]. In more recent years, Ountor has become enamored by the idea that there may be a sixth finger to the Godclaw, the deity [[Zon-Kuthon]], and it is rumoured he has taken secret steps to incorporate the dark god's teachings into the Order.
> In [[4715 AR]], the Order of the Godclaw discovered [[Iomedae]]'s [[Sword|sword]], *[[Heart's Edge|Hearts Edge]]*, leading to Ountor proudly proclaiming this discovery as a symbol of the Order's righteousness. The official church of Iomedae took umbrage to such a declaration and requested that the sacred relic be handed over, to which Ountor brusquely refused. This sparked the conflict which resulted in [[Citadel Dinyar]] being attacked and Lictor Ountor himself being imprisoned, though he was later rescued by [[Cheliax|Chelish]] agents.
