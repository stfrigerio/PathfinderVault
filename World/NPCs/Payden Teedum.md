> **Payden "Pay Day" Teedum**, Boss Teedum, is the [[Lumber Consortium|Lumber Consortiums]] overboss in [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] and the right hand and bodyguard of [[Thuldrin Kreed]]. If anyone angers his boss, he is the one to deal punishments, often in the form of dues, the latter behavior being responsible for his nickname "Pay Day". He hates [[Deldrin Baleson]], the Sheriff of [[Darkmoon Wood]], and only refrains from violent action because he does not want the Sheriff to become a martyr.
