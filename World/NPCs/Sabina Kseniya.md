> **Baroness Sabina Kseniya** is the ruler of the peasant town [[Zlatomesto]] in [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of [[Wintercrux]]. The baroness and her five sullen offspring rule the town with ironclad efficiency. Zlatomesto's peasants work hard day and night under the lash like [[Slave|slaves]], loading the caravans' wagons and sledges with ore from the mines and stones from the quarries. More than two dozen mines in the area of [[Skala Foothills]] provide Irrisen with tin, copper, [[Iron|iron]], and [[Gold|gold]]. The stone quarries in the same area produce limestone and granite, and [[Hope Lost]] produces the rare blue quartz crystals known as [[Ice diamonds|ice diamonds]].
