> **Dyrianna of House Avenstar**, Head Hetaera of [[Calistria]] and Consul of the Courtesan's Guild, is the ranking sacred prostitute and manager of the [[Pleasure Salon of Calistria]] in the [[Ascendant Court]] district of [[Absalom]].
> Around [[4688 AR]], a priest of the temple bought the beautiful half-elf out of slavery in a sin pit in the [[Coins]]. Since then, she was adopted into House Avenstar, gained control of the temple prostitutes and the entire temple of Calistria, and bought a controlling interest in the city's Courtesan's Guild, which regulates paid companions who are not stage performers nor streetwalkers.
> Through the personnel of the [[Pleasure Salon of Calistria|salon]], she controls an extensive spy network, which provides information she is discreetly willing to offer to the highest bidder. [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelish]], and increasingly [[Qadira|Qadiraan]], houses have long paid extensive contracts for her services.
