> **Merisiel** (pronounced meh-RIHS-ee-el), (sometimes called **Meri** by her friends) is the iconic [[Elf|elf]] [[Rogue|rogue]]. Having grown up amongst humans rather than elves, she outlived her original friends and family, leading to a typically dour view of the world. Merisiel follows [[Calistria]], valuing the freedom to do as she wishes and pursue what she desires. While a talented and agile combatant, she is not very cunning, preferring to solve matters with her daggers. She values gold highly and is a bit of kleptomaniac, stealing things that she really should not. Despite these flaws, she is valued by her companions and loved by her wife, [[Kyra]]. 


## Meet the iconics



“

The [[Elf|elves]] have a name for elven children unfortunate enough to be born and raised in [[Human|human]] society—the [[Forlorn]]. In a few rare cases, these foundlings or orphaned elves find loving homes with humans, although the fact that, over the course of their childhood, one-time playmates become their effective guardians and foster parents results in a strangely skewed sense of the self. Most Forlorn are not as fortunate—they live on the streets as almost eternal urchins, watching alone as their companions age and move on to greater things.
> Merisiel is one of the Forlorn, only now emerging from decades spent as a child of the streets into a young adult ready to make her own way in life. A master at stowing away on [[Ship|ships]], she has called dozens of cities home, leaving one for another when her companions outgrew her or she outlived them. Life has been hard for Merisiel, made more so by the fact that she has always found it difficult to master skills that come easily to her companions. Never the sharpest knife in the drawer, as the saying goes, Merisiel has learned to make up for this by carrying at least a dozen of them on her person. When things go wrong with her carefully laid plans (as they almost always seem to do), the knives come out and what needs to be done gets done. To date, Merisiel has not met a problem that cannot, in one way or another, be solved with [[Dagger|daggers]].

 
 [[Pygmy kech|Pygmy keches]] are simply more problems that Merisiel can solve with [[Dagger|daggers]].
> Merisiel's life experiences have taught her to enjoy things to their fullest as they occur—it is impossible to tell when the good times might end. She is open and expressive with her thoughts and emotions, and while she is always on the move and working on her latest batch of plots for easy money, in the end it comes down to being faster than everyone else—either on her feet, or with her beloved blades.
> She would not have it any other way.
