> **Susurex**, the self-styled Crystal King, is an adult [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] who has made the [[Glazen Sheet|Glazen Sheets]] region in the [[Osirian Desert]] his solitary domain. Susurex has dedicated his life to researching the mysterious origins of the region. He established his [[Lair of the Crystal King|lair]] in a crystalline formation as large as a castle that rises in the center of the Glazen Sheets. The dragon has enslaved hundreds of poor [[Yerbira]] and unsuspecting caravaneers, who now toil within and beneath the crystalline tower. Susurex's experiments aim to help him uncover the nature of Glazen Sheets. He believes that such knowledge would enable him to bring the whole of [[Osirion]] under his control, with the threat to apply the same process throughout the land.
