> **Othine Dalanse** is an accomplished undercover [[Twilight Talons]] member, working out of [[Katapesh]]. Her most recent reported success was the elimination of a [[Slavery|slaver]] ring in the city of [[Katapesh city|Katapeshs]] [[Twilight Gate]] district. Shortly thereafter she went missing. Her body washed up along the [[River Scorpius]], but was soon determined to be a fake by [[Whispershade]].
> Unfortunately for her, Othine never had eliminated the Katepshi slaver ring, but had been captured and brainwashed by them. This has caused her to go insane, turning her back on the Twilight Talons, and adopt [[Lamashtu]] as her goddess.
