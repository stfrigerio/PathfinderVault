> **Kabran Bloodeye** is a stout [[Half-orc|half-orc]] with blood-red eyes living in the town of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] in [[Andoran]]. Aside from his eyes, Kabran's most characteristic feature is his missing nose, cut from his face long ago in [[Augustana]], in punishment for his criminal activity there. He wears a bronze nose-piece over the ugly crater on his face which whistles as he sucks air though it, and dribbles blood and mucus that he wipes away with a crimson handkerchief. Kabran is the master of the [[Redrock Guild]], a criminal syndicate in Falcon's Hollow, paying [[Thuldrin Kreed]] a percentage of its take. He is also the owner of the [[Rouge Lady]], a gambling hall which doubles as an illicit brothel.
