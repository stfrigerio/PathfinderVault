> **Setsuna Kuga**, also known as **The Perfect Swordswoman**, was the founder of the modern [[Tian Xia]] nation of [[Minkai]]. For nearly three thousand years, the [[Teikoku clan]] had ruled over [[Teikoku|Teikoku Shogunate]] as fair and just leaders. However, power corrupts and, by the era of Setsuna, the corruption of the Teikoku had become so blatant that it could no longer be ignored. At the Battle of Eight Bridges, in [[3616 AR|6116 IC]], the Teikoku where defeated and then overthrown, leading to the founding of Minkai.
