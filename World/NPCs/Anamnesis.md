*For another meaning of "Anamnesis", please see Anamnesis (item).*
> **Anamnesis** can barely be described as a creature; it is a huge, green mound of sentient flesh, which acts as the central relay and library of creatures known as the [[Caulborn|caulborn]]. Also known as the **One that Watches** or the **Chrestomath**, Anamnesis sits in the Quivering Palace in the subterranean city of [[Xavorax]], far beneath the [[Varisia|Varisian]] settlement of [[Kaer Maga]]. There it is cared for and communed with by its hive of caulborn and [[Caulborn thoughtkeeper|thoughtkeepers]], who keep it alive by feeding it predigested nutrients and memories stolen from the races who live above. It can barely communicate, expressing basic emotions through changes in color, but acts as the chief repository for the caulborn. Its memories go back thousands of years, possibly to a time before the [[Runelords]] of [[Thassilon]] ruled that part of the world.
