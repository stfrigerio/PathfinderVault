> **Calisro Benarry** is the former captain of the *[[Grinning Pixie]]*, the [[Ship|ship]] that doubled as the [[Arcadian Mariner's Lodge|Arcadian Mariners Lodge]], so she was also a [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] in the [[Pathfinder Society]]. A muscular [[Half-orc|half-orc]] corsair from the [[Sodden Lands]], Benarry used to be a [[Pirate|pirate]] and has an unsavoury reputation.

 
 
> In the time since the *Grinning Pixie* was transferred to a [[Eras the Needle|new captain]] per its original contract (which Benarry ignored or evaded for a decade), she has taken on a new role as the leader of the Society's [[Horizon Hunters]] faction. Aboard her new ship *[[Glorious Payoff]]*—so named after the money the [[Decemvirate]] paid her to leave the *Pixie*—Benarry charts the unknown reaches of [[Golarion|Golarions]] oceans alongside the most adventurous Pathfinders.
