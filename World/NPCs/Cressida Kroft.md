> **Queen Cressida Kroft** of [[Korvosa]] was previously Field Marshal of Korvosa and leader of the [[Korvosan Guard|guard]] in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city.


## Appearance

> Cressida is generally described as an attractive, raven-haired woman, dressed in red [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]].


## Background

> Originally a ranking member of the Korvosan Guard and part-time [[Adventurer|adventurer]], Cressida was appointed Field Marshal by [[Eodred Arabasti II|King Eodred Arabasti II]] in [[4707 AR]], after she foiled a plot to [[Poison|poison]] a grand feast by cultists of [[Norgorber]], saving hundreds of lives, and driving the entire cult away from Korvosa. Too occupied by her new position for adventuring but unwilling to abandon her duties, she started hiring adventurers to solve problems that the Guard could not handle efficiently, and earned a reputation for being fair and supportive of them.
> After King Eodred died, his wife and successor [[Ileosa Arabasti|Ileosa]] cut the Guard's funding and inducted many of its female members into the [[Gray Maidens]]. As Ileosa's cruelty grew, Cressida became increasingly intolerant of the new queen, until she and the remaining members of the Guard assisted a band of heroes in an open rebellion that eventually culminated in Ileosa's fall and death. Since Ileosa left behind no heirs, Cressida was chosen to be Korvosa's next queen.
