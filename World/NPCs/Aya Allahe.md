> The [[Aasimar's Mercy|aasimar]] **Aya Allahe** is one of the most influential merchants of the city of [[Nantambu]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. She styles herself as the Dealer in Dreams Both Tangible and Ephemeral.
> She helped to set up [[Sharrowsmith's Exports|Sharrowsmiths Exports]], a local trading company which is actually a front for the Nantambu [[Pathfinder lodge]].  She sees the arrangement as a means for both giving her a trade link to the wider world outside the Expanse, and also helping to prevent exploitation of the region by foreign merchants such as the notorious [[Aspis Consortium]]. Of course, the fact that her role serves to enrich both herself and her city is also a consideration.
