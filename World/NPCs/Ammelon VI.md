> **Ammelon VI** was the last patriarch of the lost kingdom of [[Ghol-Gan]]. During his reign, he captured Erenkrest, a [[Phoenix|phoenix]] capable of granting *wishes*, and wished for her to stay in his aviary until his [[Soul|soul]] left the [[Material Plane]]. Since Ghol-Gan fell, his [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]] has been trapped in the temple of [[Xanthuun]] (in the modern [[Sodden Lands]]), guarding his treasure from [[Adventurer|adventurers]]. When not brooding in his throne room, he spends time with Erenkrest, who hopes that someone can destroy Ammelon and allow her to go free.
