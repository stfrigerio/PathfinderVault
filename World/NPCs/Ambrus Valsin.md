> [[Venture-Captain]] **Ambrus Valsin** runs the daily operations of the [[Grand Lodge]] at the [[Decemvirate|Decemvirates]] command.  Meticulous with details and annoyed by inefficiency, Ambrus makes a point to supervise all important duties within the Grand Lodge, and keeps a long list of relatively safe but time-consuming jobs on file, ready to hand out to rookie [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] to keep them busy and out of the way of more experienced agents. Tall and meticulously groomed, Ambrus doesn't appreciate backtalk and reserves particularly strenuous assignments for those who annoy him.
> Valsin's Pathfinder training regime incorporates all three schools of the Society (Swords, Scrolls and Spells) in order to keep the Society well-rounded.


## Relationships

> Valsin works closely with other leaders of the Pathfinder Society. He frequently meets with Head Initiate [[Janira Gavix]] and the masters of Spells, Scrolls and Swords to assess the abilities of prospective agents. His relationship with [[Zarta Dralneen]] is cordial but strained as he remains suspicious of her due to her past affiliations.
> 
Although intimidating and often disliked by newer Pathfinders, those with more experience typically have garner respect for Ambrus' experience.
