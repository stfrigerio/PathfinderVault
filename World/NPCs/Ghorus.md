> **Ghorus** was a renegade [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] who led the [[Goroth Lodge]] in the [[Verduran Forest]] in the 1st century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]]. After the Lodge was defeated by [[Taldor|Taldors]] [[First Army of Exploration]] in [[37 AR]], he fled to the nation of [[Nex]]. The great archmage [[Nex (person)|Nex]] asked him to create edible plantlife that would thrive in the magic-scarred wastelands that dotted his domain after the wars with [[Geb's Rest]]. After centuries, these creatures eventually developed sentience (whether Ghorus intended this or not is unknown) and still can be found in the land of Nex, where they are known as [[Ghoran|ghorans]]. Today, ghorans are formally classed as citizens of Nex. Ghorus taught his created race a couple of useful [[Spell|spells]] to help them survive: *pinecone bomb* and *woodland rune*.
