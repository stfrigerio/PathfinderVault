> **Ralla Hebbradan** is one of the half-dozen prostitutes in the [[Rouge Lady]] gambling hall and brothel in the town of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]]. While not the most beautiful prostitute of [[Kabran Bloodeye]], Ralla is ever in demand by wealthy patrons, as she has somehow managed to maintain an attractive appearance of sincere fragility. She works in the Rouge Lady to earn enough [[Currency|copper]] for herself and her only living relative, her young brother Hollin, to survive. Hollin hates the town passionately for how he and his sister are forced to live. Neither Ralla nor Hollin are aware that Ralla is not truly Hollin's sister, but rather the [[Changeling|changeling]] daughter of the [[Green hag|green hag]] [[Igale]], who lives deep in the Kingtower Woods.
