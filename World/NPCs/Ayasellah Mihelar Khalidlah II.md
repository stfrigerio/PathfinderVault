> **Ayasellah Mihelar Khalidlah II** is the current grand sultana and military leader of the [[City of Brass]], and jointly rules the city with Grand Vizier [[Abdul-Qawi]]. The two maintain an easy d√©tente, but are locked in a secret political struggle behind the scenes. Ayasellah claims that her predecessor [[Hakim Khalid Suleiman XXIII]] was assassinated by Abdul-Qawi and offers a huge bounty for those who could bring her proof, although most people believe that she herself killed him in a military coup.
