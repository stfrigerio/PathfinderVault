> **Ekat Kassen** was a crusader and fortune seeker who came to serve [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] in [[4515 AR]]. While he fought with distinction for some years he decided to leave the military to find his fortune. He had been traveling all over the region around the [[Lake Encarthan]] when he settled down on the banks of the [[Tourondel River]] in the [[Fangwood 1]] of [[Nirmathas]] in [[4522 AR]] after a very profitable adventure. He founded the village known as [[Kassen's Hold|Kassens Hold]] which quickly grew and prospered as a natural stopover for those traveling up and down the river to [[Skelt]].
> Ekat Kassen died on 11 [[Neth]], [[4535 AR]], from a mortal wound after a bloody battle where he fought his old companion Asar Vergas who was raiding the town for two months seeking revenge against Ekat.
