> **Toff Ornelos** is the head of [[House Ornelos]], as well as the current headmaster of the [[Acadamae]] in [[Korvosa]]. Unlike some of his predecessors, Ornelos does not delegate authority to the various heads of the Acadamae's schools of [[Magic|magic]], preferring to reserve as much as he can for himself.


## Acadamae

> Toff Ornelos, one of the most talented magic-users in all of [[Varisia]], has been the headmaster of the Acadamae since around [[4678 AR]].


## Family

> He is the uncle of [[Gasta Weagra]], the owner of the [[Gilded Orrery]], a magic shop in Korvosa's exclusive [[Heights]] district.
> Toff is a descendant of [[Volshyenek Ornelos]], Founder of House Ornelos and the [[Acadamae]]. Volshynek Ornelos was in turn impersonated by the [[Infernal duke|infernal duke]] [[Lorthact]] for over 200 years and who remains an influence on Toff, the [[Acadamae]], and [[House Ornelos]].
> Toff is also related to Captain Fedele Ornelos, a [[Hippogriff|hippogriff]]-riding member of the [[Sable Company]].
> A more unfortunate family predecessor is Lord High Magistrate Remsev Ornelos who was murdered along with his family in Korvosa in [[4491 AR]] by angry dockworkers assisted and provoked by members of House Viamio.
