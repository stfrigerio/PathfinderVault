> **Orik Vancaskerkin**, a not-so-lucky professional soldier, landed himself into some trouble in his hometown of [[Riddleport]] when he killed an [[Alchemist|alchemist]] for having sold him a counterfeit *elixir of love* which he had intended to use upon a [[Tiefling|tiefling]] prostitute named [[Lavender Lil]]. As that alchemist was the brother of [[Clegg Zincher]], one of Riddleport's powerful crime lords, Orik was forced to leave town, never to return. His journeys eventually took him to [[Magnimar]], where he encountered a small bandit group led by the fallen [[Aasimar's Mercy|aasimar]] [[Nualia Tobyn]] and became a hired mercenary for that group.
