> **Eriboe** is a female [[Cyclops|cyclops]] who serves as the bouncer at the [[Faded Seahorse]], a tavern in [[Hell Harbor]]. Eriboe is not the raging brute that many other cyclopes are as she is what is called a 'high cyclops'. In fact, many people are surprised by her pleasant demeanour; she also is known to be a great teller of filthy jokes. Her massive size means that when her duties as a bouncer require her to break some skulls, she is more than up to the task.
