> **Reneis Ordranti**, or **Reneis Ordranti-Caliphvaso**, is a controversial figure in [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] life as he is, according to his missing mother Millaera, the heir to the throne of Ustalav. He is supposedly the son of the Eunuch Prince [[Valislav Ordranti]], if true it would give Reneis the right to the throne upon which his (supposed) uncle, [[Aduard Ordranti III|Prince Aduard Ordranti III]], sits. Reneis's biggest supporter is his conniving aunt [[Carmilla Caliphvaso]] who schemes and plots to place him on the throne no matter what the cost. 
> As he has been sequestered by his aunt, he has experienced little of the outside world beyond his family's country estate in Briargate, in the county of [[Ardeal]]. As a result he lacks social grace and suffers from migraines. Even so, he has been groomed to wear the crown from a very young age and possesses both a keen intellect and fine physique.
> Prince Ordranti regularly invites his nephew to court but the Countess has ensured that the two have never met by creating well-reasoned refusals in reply to each offer.
