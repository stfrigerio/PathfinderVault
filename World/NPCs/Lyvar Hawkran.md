> **Lyvar Hawkran** was head warden of [[Harrowstone]] prison near [[Ravengro]], in [[Canterwall]] county, [[Ustalav]], where he bravely died in a great fire in [[4661 AR]] preventing a mass prisoner escape by sacrificing himself. He was married to [[Vesorianna Hawkran]] and they both lived in a house within the prison walls; unfortunately, his wife also lost her life that fateful day. After his death, the spirit of Warden Hawkran rose as a [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]] and continued his work to keep the spirits of the inmates within the prison. His death and that of his wife are commemorated on the [[Harrowstone Memorial]] in Ravengro.
