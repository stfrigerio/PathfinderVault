> **Elgrid Twelvehammers** is a [[Cleric|priest]] of [[Torag]] and the spiritual leader of the small [[Dwarf|dwarven]] community of [[Bellows]] in the [[Andoren]] capital of [[Almas]]. Here she helps lead the fewer than 100 dwarves who live here, most of whom are descended from the refugees of [[Tar Khadurrm]], the once-mighty dwarven city destroyed by the [[Volcano|volcano]] [[Droskar's Crag|Droskars Crag]] in [[3980 AR]].
