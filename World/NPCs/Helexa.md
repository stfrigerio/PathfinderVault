> The [[Brass dragon|brass dragon]] **Helexa** is best known for her involvement with the infamous *Volume 11* of the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]*.  Helexa, it is believed, passed on numerous inaccurate or misleading statements regarding the nature of [[Dragon|dragons]] to the [[Pathfinder chronicler]] [[Dalania Pontius]] in an effort to make them more interesting; these tales were published in the aforementioned volume.  These inaccuracies ended up causing the deaths of numerous [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] and countless injuries before the volume was amended.
