> **Khemet I** (*ruled [[4609 AR|4609]] to [[4649 AR]]*) was the first native [[Garundi human ethnicity|Garundi]] [[Pharaoh|pharaoh]] of [[Osirion]] after over 3,000 years of [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]] rule. His ascension in 4609 AR marked the start of the Third Age of Osirion.



## A legacy restored

> Able to trace his lineage back to the pharaoh's of [[History of Osirion|Osirions First Age]], Khemet I, previously known as **Harun** and also known as the **Forthbringer**, tapped into a spirit of Osirian nationalism that was undimmed despite centuries of rule by satraps of [[Kelesh]] followed by independent sultans of Keleshite descent. A powerful [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Abadar]] who arrived to Sothis with a Garundi army and the support of the [[Children of Wadjet]], he was able to reinforce his right to the throne by demonstrating his ability to recruit Osirion's powerful elder [[Elemental|elementals]] to his cause. With the country already destabilized following the death of [[Aroden]] in [[4606 AR]], the sultan and her family fled the country, and Khemet became pharaoh after a nearly bloodless coup.
> The [[Cult of the Dawnflower]] and the Church of [[Sarenrae]] in general were also instrumental in his rise to power. In fact, they had entered into a secret alliance with Khemet a year before his return. Empress Rashanah XXVII of [[Kelesh]] quickly recognized Khemet I's rule in exchange for ethnic Keleshites in the country being allowed to gain citizenship and avoid retaliation, to which he agreed.


## The Forthbringer's rule

> Khemet I reinstated [[Sothis]] as the nation's capital, and oversaw the construction of the [[Palace of the Forthbringer]] to be his residence. There he constructed the original red sandstone chambers for [[Summoning|summoning]] elementals and other creatures. Khemet I also ordered the restoration of the [[Sphinx Head|Black Sphinx]].
> Later in his reign, he became increasingly withdrawn. Some felt that this was because he had to devote most of his time to maintaining the pacts he had made with the various elementals. Nevertheless, he ruled unchallenged for forty years, and was succeeded by his son, [[Khemet II]].


## Family

> Pharaoh Khemet II had at least six children, including:

> - Pharaoh Khemet II
> - [[Kasiya|Prince Kasiya]], his sixth child
