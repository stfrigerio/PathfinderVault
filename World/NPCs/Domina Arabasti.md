> **Queen Domina of Korvosa** (ruled [[4667 AR|4667]]–[[4686 AR]]) was a monarch of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city-state of [[Korvosa]], and best known for bringing the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Nail]] to Varisia in [[4682 AR]].


## History

> Queen Domina's reign began in [[4667 AR]] after she deposed the imposter [[Chadris Porphyria III|King Chadris]] of House Porphyria and set about dismantling his house's presence in Korvosa. Domina came from the [[Cheliax|Chelaxian]] line of the Arabasti family. She was a worshipper of the [[Malebranche]] [[Malacoda]] and brought with her a closer connection to the new [[Diabolism|diabolism]] that was now so prevalent in Cheliax. Queen Domina greatly improved trade relations with places like [[Egorian]], and many prominent Chelish trading houses opened branches in Korvosa during this period. Queen Domina used the money raised by this new prosperity to build; she erected many famous Korvosan buildings like the [[Pantheon of Many]], the [[Temple of Asmodeus Korvosa|Temple of Asmodeus]], Domina's Wall, and, away from the city, [[Citadel Vraid]].
> In [[4682 AR]], Queen Domina entreated the aid the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Rack]], [[Order of the Scourge]], and [[Order of the Godclaw]], but was refused by all three. Her offer was finally accepted by the [[Order of the Nail]], who relocated to [[Varisia]]. Upon their arrival, the Queen funded the construction of [[Citadel Vraid]] in the [[Mindspin Mountains]] and requested their aid in harassing and intimidating the growing power of Korvosa's trade rival, [[Magnimar]]. The Hellknight order refused, and the Korvosan monarchy has begrudged them since.


## Legacy

> Queen Domina's reign is now looked back on by most residents of Korvosa as a golden age not since repeated. She had two children, Arkapallus, who would later become [[Eodred Arabasti II|King Eodred Arabasti II]], and the illegitimate, deformed [[Tiefling|tiefling]] [[Venster Arabasti|Venster]]. She is buried in the royal crypts of [[Castle Korvosa]].
