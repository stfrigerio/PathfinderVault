> **Thulgroon** is a [[Veiled master|veiled master]] who has dwelt in the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] ruins beneath [[Magnimar]] for many millennia and follows a goal anathema to its kind: becoming a [[Deity|deity]].


## Associates

> In the [[Age of Darkness]], Thulgroon forged an alliance with thousands of [[Shriezyx|shriezyx]], one based entirely on benefit, as the shriezyx cannot be [[Magic|magically]] controlled; this also ensures that Thulgroon's foes cannot glean its secret plans from the shriezyx. Akorsavatha, whom it uplifted from the shriezyx stock, serves as the intermediary between Thulgroon and the lesser shriezyx. Ouvoor, an uplifted [[Chuul|chuul]], serves as commander of Thulgroon's chuul servants, and Sicuro serves as its spy on the surface. Thulgroon also counts many underlings among Magnimar's elite.
> Thulgroon's presence was discovered by the Bonds of the Chained Eyes, a cult of [[Kroina]], whose leader Ehawi Sees-All-Words has been trying hard to uncover its true identity since then. The cult knows that Thulgroon is an [[Alghollthu|alghollthu]] operating in the undercity, but mistakenly believes it to be a mere [[Alghollthu master|alghollthu master]]. They have found no candidate trustworthy and capable enough to defeat Thulgroon.


## Background

> Thulgroon survived [[Earthfall]] by hiding itself in the [[Darklands]], miles below Magnimar. It re-emerged centuries afterward, and began to build an information network by kidnapping local [[Varisian|Varisians]]. As Magnimar was resettled, Thulgroon built an immense lair beneath the city under its control.
> Due to its long isolation, Thulgroon came to believe that the alghollthus' downfall came from their staunch [[Atheism|atheism]], and that they instead need to command [[Deity|deific]] power so they can understand the cosmos and hold dominion over the gods as well. Thus it adopted a goal alien to the alghollthus: becoming a deity.
> Thulgroon ruled out spontaneous [[Ascension|ascension]] as unreliable and the [[Test of the Starstone]] as impractical. Through the ascension of [[Irori]] through self-perfection, Thulgroon believes that the secret to divinity comes from the [[Soul|Eternal Ember]] and the alghollthus' genesis. To that end, it has conducted numerous experiments in the Thassilonian [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]] [[Laboratory|laboratories]] beneath Magnimar, leaving behind countless living failed experiments, while keeping its research hidden from its kind lest it invites their reprisal before it can achieve divinity.
