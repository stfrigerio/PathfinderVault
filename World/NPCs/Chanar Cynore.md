> **Lady Chanar Cynore** is one of the most respected figures in [[Solku]]. A veteran of many sieges, including the [[Battle of Red Hail]], Lady Cynore has forged a reputation as a fierce warrior as well as a dedicated champion for [[Sarenrae]] and Solku. The people look to her for spiritual guidance but also for impassioned speeches and concrete plans of action. [[Hazic Kel-Kalaar|Lord Kel-Kalaars]] policy of careful action strikes her as dangerously slow and overly cautious, despite his similar agenda. Lady Cynore is the head of an order of Sarenrae's [[Paladin|paladins]] supporting the city. She oversees the activities of [[Sarenrae's Lambent Citadel|Sarenraes Lambent Citadel]] and distributes the collected tithes to support the poor in the city, in addition to maintaining the temple and securing the [[Weapon|weapons]] for its defense.
> It is said that Vedie was an ancestor of Lady Cynore.
> Chanar Cynore was born into a Sarenite family in [[Absalom]]. She had decided to serve the Dawnflower since she was a child and became a paladin as soon as she reached adulthood. Her early service was peaceful but, while she was on a mission in [[Osirion]], she encountered the militant [[Cult of the Dawnflower]]. Saddened by the sect's neglect of the goddess' tenets of mercy and redemption, she decided to move to the traditional Sarenite stronghold of Solku to bring them a kinder interpretation of Sarenrae's faith. Over the next 14 years she rose steadily through the ranks to become the head of the Lambent Citadel. It was the [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]] siege in [[4701 AR]] that changed her view: she could no longer believe that all creatures deserved a chance at redemption. She now poured all her strength into slaying the gnolls and has won the admiration of her people.
> Today, Lady Cynore believes that the best way to keep Solku safe is to launch a pre-emptive strike, but understands it is difficult to convince the still-recovering town. She fears that Lord Kel-Kalaar's more cautious approach may give the gnoll army the time to organize a new assault. Rumors are muttered that the armies of the [[Noor|Red Sultana]] are amassing again in the mountains.
