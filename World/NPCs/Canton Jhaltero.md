> **Count Canton Jhaltero** is the head of the [[Kintargo|Kintargan]] aristocratic [[House Jhaltero]] based at the Jhaltero Estate in [[The Greens|the Greens]] district of [[Kintargo]]. Politically, his loyalties lie more with Kintargo than [[Cheliax]] and the ruling [[House Thrune]]. His House is a member of the aristocratic [[Court of Coin]] and his House interests centre around quarrying stone and [[Silver|silver]] but also focuses on the trade of valuable information.
