> The [[Glabrezu|glabrezu]] [[Demon|demon]] **Mokravud** is one of [[Treerazer|Treerazers]] lieutenants, and unusually for his type, practices great patience and subtlety when targeting his victims. He has served the Lord of the Blasted Tarn for centuries, and prefers going after select [[Elven|elven]] officers, rather than decimating entire platoons.
