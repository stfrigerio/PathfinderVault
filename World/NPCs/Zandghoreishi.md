> **Zandghoreishi**, also known as the **Jade Prophet**, is a [[Shambling mound|shambling mound]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] who has a large following among his kind. His prostelyzations focus on a claim that the annihilation of [[Lirgen]] and [[Yamasa]] and the flooding of their lands was the first part of a cleansing wave that will clear the way for the awakening of the planet. The region where he preaches, near the [[Sodden Lands]] and the [[Mwangi Expanse]], has been devastated by shambling mound attacks. In the wake of the destroyed communities, the mounds formed the wreckage into large mounds of intricate shapes and forms. So far the deserts of [[Garund]] have formed a barrier the shambling mounds have been unable to cross, which is a comfort for those who live on the other side.
