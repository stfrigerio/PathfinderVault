> **Sylvanna Orlovsky** is the niece of [[Poul Orlovsky|Lord Poul Orlovsky]], the ruling lord of [[House Orlovsky]]. She is the captain of her house's forces and the formal representative of her house in the [[Brevic]] town of Zmeyka, where she resides; she often acts as her uncle's ambassador further afield.



## Appearance

> She is described as an attractive woman with delicate features and golden hair, though also known to be proud and headstrong.


## Background

> Sylvanna is a skilled horsewoman and known for her ability at jousting. She rides her [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|steed]], **Silvermane**, whom she cares for herself in the stables at Zmeyka.


## Relationships

> She has a deep mistrust of [[House Surtova]] and, like most nobles of her house, has long been a supporter of the now-disappeared [[House Rogarvia]]. Indeed, she was engaged to a member of House Rogarvia from birth until the [[Vanishing]] intervened and overturned that plan. She has known the noble [[Lander Lebeda]] as a friend since childhood.
