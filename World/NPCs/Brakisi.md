> **Lord Brakisi** was a hot headed [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|urban ranger]] and one of the original members of the [[Silver Ravens]] who protected the city of [[Kintargo]] during the [[CheliaxHistory|Chelish Civil War]]. Brakisi was the last of the original members of the Silver Ravens to die after the Chelish Civil War, he survived the attack by the [[Pit fiend|pit fiend]] Oughorthan that killed [[Amyreid]] and [[Kyda]] in [[4640 AR]] and was himself responsible for the death of [[Ba Brackenthorn]] in [[4644 AR]]. In the end, Brakisi was killed by Reya Naulvaneti (who would soon after found the new [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Torrent]]) during a botched attempt to kidnap the [[House Thrune|Thrune]]-appointed Lord-Mayor's son. Brakisi's murder of his fellow Silver Raven, Ba Brackenthorn, and his attempt to kidnap a young child led to his disgrace and, with it, left a black mark on the legacy of the Silver Ravens.
