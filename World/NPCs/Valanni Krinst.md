> Valanni Krinst occupies a very important place in the politics of his home city of [[Magnimar]], he serves as Lord-Mayor [[Haldmeer Grobaras|Haldmeer Grobarass]] personal assistant and messenger. Krinst abuses his position as his assistant for the good of the city, ignoring some of the mayor's ridiculous demands or making sure that the order never reach the right person etc, he is a subtle saboteur. All of this is highly illegal and would get Krinst into a lot of trouble if known but it he has helped Magnimar immensely with his meddlings, something that almost no one knows.
