> **Rath Sandstalker** is the cruel and cunning leader of the White Canyon tribe of [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]]. He is not very clever. He takes terrific pride in his gnolls' accomplishments and is convinced they deserve to rule over [[Katapesh]]. He is more practically concerned with ensuring his followers' survival and establishing a strong gnoll race. In pursuit of these goals, he considers a tidy profit as a bonus.
> Rath wielded a gnoll relic known as the *[[Brazen Claw]]* at the [[Siege of Solku]].
