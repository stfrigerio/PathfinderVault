> The self-styled **High Justice** is a powerful [[Astradaemon|astradaemon]] exiled from [[Abaddon]] who seeks to awaken the long-dead [[Oinodaemon]] by feeding it sinful [[Soul|souls]].


## Background

> The High Justice was exiled by the [[Four Horsemen]] for trying to communicate with the eclipse looming over Abaddon. After spending aeons in the [[Maelstrom]], he gained a new understanding of the [[Multiverse|multiverse]] and became the mouthpiece of the Oinodaemon. He correctly believes that the eclipse is the Oinodaemon's eye, and seeks to open it so the Oinodaemon can annihilate the Horsemen and replace them with him.
> After fishing up the [[Soul|soul]] of [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Karzoug]], the High Justice established his Court of Amendment in an ancient temple to the Oinodaemon in the [[Boneyard]], which overlooks the expanse of Abaddon, from which he was still banned. His [[Daemon|daemon]] minions hunt for powerful souls across the [[Great Beyond]], to be brought before him: those whose sins outweigh Karzoug's are fed to the Oinodaemon's eye, while the others (which make up the majority, as Karzoug's sins are substantial) are returned to the [[River of Souls]] to lessen [[Psychopomp|psychopomp]] interference.


## Associates

> The High Justice employs astradaemons as soul gatherers, [[Thanadaemon|thanadaemons]] (who have abandoned their original patron [[Charon]]) as bailiffs, and [[Lacridaemon|lacridaemons]] to mock intruders and defendants.
