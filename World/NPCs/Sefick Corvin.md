> A notorious prisoner of [[Harrowstone]] near [[Ravengro]], **Sefick Corvin'**s crimes earnt him the title of **Father Charlatan**: he pretended to be a priest of any number of churches in order to swindle gullible worshippers out of money through false miracles and healing. He worked alongside [[Sczarni]] accomplices, who would murder to cover up any exposure of the charlatan.
> Though Corvin was no murderer himself, the churches against whom he blasphemed sought and won the greatest sentence possible for the criminal: imprisonment in Harrowstone, wrapped in chains depicting the symbols of the wronged churches. Corvin was removed to Harrowstone in [[4661 AR]], along with four other notorious criminals, and died that same year in the great fire that destroyed the prison.
