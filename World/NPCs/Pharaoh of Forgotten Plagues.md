> The **Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues**  was one of [[Osirion|Osirions]] earliest rulers during the [[Age of Destiny]]. He is known to have fought a war against the [[Jistka Imperium]] in an effort to expand his kingdom to the west in the 31st century before [[Aroden|Arodens]] ascension. 
> Needing an ally in this conflict, he built the [[House of Oblivion]] in the deserts of what is now [[Thuvia]], to bribe the [[Div|div]] lord [[Ahriman]]. The Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues was eventually defeated by the [[Song Pharaoh]] in [[-3047 AR]].
> In addition, the Pharaoh also summoned the daemonic [[Harbinger|harbinger]] [[Zelishkar]] to aid him in destroying his enemies, in particular the Jistka Imperium. With his service complete, the Pharaoh constructed the [[Labyrinth of Shiman-Sekh]] with the purpose of imprisoning Zelishkar.
