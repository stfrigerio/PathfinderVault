> **Sorrina Westyr** is the [[Pathfinder Society|Pathfinder Societys]] current [[Master of Spells]], replacing [[Aram Zey]], whom, ironically, had originally replaced Westyr. She is an oread woman with slate-gray skin and long silvery-white hair. 
> In response to the loss of Aram Zey, Westyr began teaching an advanced studies course in extradimensional and interplanar phenomena, in the hopes of preventing both future losses and better prepare the student pathfinders for unforeseen challenges.


## Background

> Sorrina Westyr was originally a human from northern [[Garund]] where she studied in the magical academies there. She accepted the position of Spellmaster for the Pathfinder Society but was presumed dead during a long research mission on the Plane of Earth which resulted in Aram Zey taking over her position in the Society. However, Westyr survived and emerged from her ordeal as an [[Oread|oread]]—a geniekin of elemental earth. 
> The phenomenon that transformed her presents a constant, fascinating distraction from her studies into the development of new types of magical wayfinders as well as the origins and properties of aeon stones.
