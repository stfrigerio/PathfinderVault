> **Countess Sasandra Livgrace** is much beloved by the people of her home county of [[Sinaria]], in a city that values musical talent as highly as [[Karcau]] (the so called Village of Voices) her peerless talent as an [[Opera|opera]] virtuoso has endeared Sasandra to her people. Sasandra holds court from her home [[Starling House]] that overlooks the beautiful [[Lake Prophyria]]. Sasandra's reign has been relatively stable despite a "kidnapping" in her youth that has lead to many a scandalous rumour. Despite her youthful indiscretions, Countess Sasandra Livgrace is considered one of the most eligible bachelorettes in all of [[Ustalav]].
