> **Salgarth** is the cousin of [[Mindra Macini]], who runs [[Freehold]] in [[Sargava]].
> Freehold is run in accordance with the tradition established by [[Olgran Macini]] of treating the native [[Mwangi human ethnicity|Mwangi]] as equals. Salgarth is trying to gain control of Freehold, as he would prefer to see it run in a less equitable fashion.
