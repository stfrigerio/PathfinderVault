> The **King of Biting Ants** is a strange [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]] whose body consisted of a swarm of [[Ant|ants]]. He set up a stronghold at the [[Doorway to the Red Star]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. The sorcerer was defeated long ago by the legendary [[Jatembe|Old-Mage Jatembe]].


## Background

> In -3505 AR, when trying to use the Doorway to the Red Star's powers to dominate the surrounding region, the King of Biting Ants was defeated by Old-Mage Jatembe. Although some legends state that the King of Biting Ants was destroyed by Jatembe, who then sealed up the ruins of the Doorway to the Red Star, in truth he was only driven to [[Akiton]] through the Doorway alongside his acolytes. When his defeat was imminent, he hid a few component ants in the ruins around the Doorway to the Red Star, which eventually came together to create the *Vesicant Egg*, an [[Artifact|artifact]] that would allow him to return.
