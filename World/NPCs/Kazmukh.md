> **King Kazmukh** of the [[Doggadth|Impenetrable Kingdom of Doggadth]] was one of the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] kings who signed the [[Kerse Accord]] in [[2332 AR]] that ended the civil wars that had plagued the [[Five Kings Mountains]] for seven centuries. His reign was far from easy, however, as  His face is one of the [[Carved Kings]] and stands over Great Pass and the studious city of [[Tar-Kazmukh]] is named in his honor.
