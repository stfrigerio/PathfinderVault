> **Lullaby Vancaskerkin** is a member of the [[Roadkeepers]], a group of bandits based in the [[Churlwood]] just south of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of [[Roderic's Cove|Roderics Cove]].
> Lullaby is the daughter of [[Saul Vancaskerkin|Saul Vancaskerkins]] brother. Although Saul was her uncle, she spent more time in his house than the one of her birth. Lullaby was born under a different name, which she disliked and consequently changed. She eventually joined the Roadkeepers, and came to desire leadership of the group. As she was unwilling to murder for the position, she originally waited for the group's leader, Nightthrush, to die naturally. However, this failed to happen quickly enough for Lullaby's patience and she formed a new plan.
> Lullaby plans to secede entirely from the group, and seeks to amass enough wealth to buy the other bandits' loyalty and establish a thieves' guild in Roderic's Cove. In the longer term, she intends to return to [[Riddleport]] and meet up with her uncle.
