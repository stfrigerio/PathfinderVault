> **Archbaroness Porcia Victocora** was the head of the former [[House Victocora]], which was one of the most prominent noble houses of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Kintargo]]. 



## Fate

> Porcia was killed and House Victocora was effectively destroyed during the [[Night of Ashes]] in [[4715 AR]].


## Family

> Porcia was the wife of Aneran Victocora and mother of [[Rexus Victocora]]. They were permissive parents who encouraged and supported Rexus's personal freedom and education.


## Background

> Unbeknownst to nearly everyone, including her family, Porcia was a member of the highly secretive [[Sacred Order of Archivists]], a group of worshippers of [[Irori]] dedicated to the preservation and restoration of the true history of Cheliax that has been redacted and altered by [[House Thrune]]. This was enough to earn the wrath of newly ascended [[Barzillai Thrune|Lord-Mayor Barzillai Thrune]], who attacked and destroyed the Order's headquarters beneath [[Hocum's Fantasmagorium|Hocums Fantasmagorium]] during the infamous Night of Ashes.
