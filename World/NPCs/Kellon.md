> **Governor Kellon** was the founder of modern [[Molthune]]. Originally the territory's governor under the rule of [[Cheliax]], Kellon led Molthune's secession in [[4632 AR]] during the chaos of the [[Thrune Ascendancy]], a rebellion that inspired [[Galt]] and [[Andoran]] to do the same. Kellon tried to establish order and security in the newly forged nation, but the further rebellion in [[Nirmathas]] in [[4648 AR]] undermined Molthune's stability.
