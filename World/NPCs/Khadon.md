> **Khadon the Mighty**, sometimes written **Khaddon the Mighty**, arrived in the [[Five Kings Mountains]] in [[3197 AR]] aiming to destroy the [[Orc|orcs]] and end their 700-year occupation of the region. After 82 years of war, Khaddon defeated the orcs in [[3'9 AR]] at the [[Battle of Splitmist Pass]]. He hunted down the orc leader, Tarkdok Manyspears and killed him. The corpse of Tarkdok was displayed throughout the mountains. Khaddon founded the empire of [[Tar Khadurrm]] in 3279 AR and the city of [[Jernashall]] in [[3312 AR]]. Jernashall became the pre-eminent city of the new empire. It was so important that the nations of [[Cheliax]] and [[Isger]] petitioned Tar Khadurrm to help them build a surface city close to Jernashall. With the help of the dwarves, the city of [[Raseri Kanton]] was founded in [[3451 AR]], and became a vital trade center in the region. Khadon passed away from extreme age in the same year and his son, [[Sidrik]] was crowned king of Tar Khadurrm.
> Sometime during the war, Khaddon retook [[Saggorak|Saggoraks]] southern district and renamed it [[Kovlar]].
