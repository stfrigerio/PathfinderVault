> **Master Tandre Cullerton** was the head of the [[Cullerton family|Cullertons]], the oldest of the three merchant families ruling the small [[Lambreth|River Kingdom of Lambreth]] as the [[Triunes of Lambreth|Triunes]].
> When Lambreth was threatened by imminent invasion from neighbouring [[Razmiran]] in [[4675 AR]], the Triunes, in desperation, offered the lordship of the realm to [[Kamdyn Arnefax]] if he could defeat the invaders. When Arnefax returned victorious from the battle against the Razmiri invaders he demanded the lordship of Lambreth. Master Tandre Cullerton suggested a delay in the recognition of Arnefax's lordship but the [[Knight|knight]] coolly snapped the man's neck. Lady Cullerton was also swiftly killed when she rushed to save her husband. The [[Angelidis family]] and the [[Vizcarra family]] swore fealty at once and the Cullertons were dispossessed and exiled under penalty of death.
