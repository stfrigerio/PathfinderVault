> **Marcos Farabellus** is the current [[Master of Swords]] and blademaster within [[Absalom|Absaloms]] [[Pathfinder Society]].
> The most popular of the Three Masters of the Society's [[Grand Lodge]], Marcos is known for his storytelling, good humour, and devil-may-care approach to combat and training. In truth, his bravado is more a teaching technique to keep his audience rapt, with his true goal being the preservation of [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]]' lives. To this end, for instance, Farabellus teaches Pathfinder trainees about the treasures of ancient [[Azlant]], how to rescue them, and how to do so while staying alive.


## Shadow Lodge

> Since the [[Shadow Lodge|Shadow Lodges]] rise to prominence, Marcos has done his utmost to heal the rifts between Pathfinders and takes a dim view of intolerance within the ranks. Although this has caused some friction with a number of colleagues, he is still a beloved venture-captain.
