> **Laharra Seaspray** is the current high priest of [[Besmara]] in the enormous [[Besmara's Temple|Besmaras Temple]] on [[Besmara's Throne|Besmaras Throne]] island in the [[Shackles]]. The old woman is always found within the temple. The temple lies on the [[Holy Isle]] at the center of the beautiful [[Cove of the Queen]]. Half of the temple is submerged in the islet's tiny bay. Priests and acolytes in black [[Silk|silk]] work in the temple, performing ceremonies and welcoming those that end their [[Voyage Besmara|Voyage]] there. The high priest hears the tales of the pilgrims' Voyage, evaluates their devotion to the [[Deity|goddess]], and then communes with Besmara herself to determine the pilgrims' Holy Labors. Those that succeed in the dangerous tasks are granted a blessing and a coveted *Besmaran Pearl*.
