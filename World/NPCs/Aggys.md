> **Aggys, the Crone in the Cart**, runs the [[Witchmarket]], a [[First World]] organisation that travels to [[Golarion]] to sell bizarre goods to [[Mortal|mortals]].
> She appears as an impossibly old woman, and has an uncanny ability to provide customers with the item they need most. Some attribute this to an ability to see into the future.
