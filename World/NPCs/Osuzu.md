> **Osuzu** is the head priestess tending the sacred [[Tree of Souls]] in [[Kasai]]. She has requested aid from fellow [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] and followers of [[Tsukiyo]] across [[Minkai]] to deal with the giant cicadas that eat at the tree's roots and have prevented it from blooming for more than three years; despite the urgency of her call, none of note has answered.
