> **Styrian Kindler** is a researcher and explorer, and nephew of famed author [[Ailson Kindler]]. Though based in [[Caliphas]], he is currently searching the [[Lost Coast]] of [[Varisia]] for stories of the [[Sandpoint Devil]].


## Relatives

***Main article: [[Kindler family]]***
> Styrian's mother was Ellishan Kindler, sister of then-[[Pathfinder]] Ailson Kindler, and his father was solicitor Blake Thorenly of [[Ardis]]. Styrian was a rambunctious child egged on by his aunt, who regaled him with tales of her adventures and secrets of the [[Kindler family]] estate in August House. However, Ailson doesn't necessarily approve of his adventuring ways.


## Writings

> Styrian's works include the *Account of Ostog the Unslain*, which describes the extraordinary survival of the [[Ostog|titular Ulfen barbarian]] in adventures across western [[Avistan]].


> [[F Wesley Schneider]] created and plays Styrian, leading to a section being dedicated to Styrian in the *[[NPC Guide]]*.
