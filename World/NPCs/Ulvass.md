> **Ulvass** was a [[Linnorm King]] and explorer who founded the [[Ulfen]] colony of [[Valenhall]] on [[Arcadia]].


## Background

> In [[-473 AR]], Ulvass heard the call of Valenhall, which called him across the [[Arcadian Ocean]] and described a place of endless glory. When he set out across the ocean to find Valenhall, reality and legends diverged. [[Skald|Skalds]] sing that Ulvass found hitherto-unknown glory, knowledge, and treasure in Valenhall and built a mighty hold for [[Ulfen]] warriors to come to die in an earthly paradise, fighting glorious battles by day, and participating in great feasts by night, and that Ulvass still lives in eternal bliss.
> In truth, Ulvass stopped hearing the call once he stepped foot on Arcadia, where he only found a dangerous frontier. Without resources to come back [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|home]], Ulvass and his companions established a village called Port Valen, from where Ulvass continued his search until his death.
