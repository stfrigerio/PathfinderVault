> **Esmet Silkenlock** is the mayor of the large town of [[Sevenarches]] in the [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of the same name. A [[Kelesh|Keleshite]] former thief, Esmet comes from [[Katapesh]] and proved herself a very efficient leader and administrator. She has complete operational authority over town matters, except for the occasional orders from the [[Oakstewards]]. Leoti, the current [[Voice of the Wind]], visits the town of Sevenarches once a week supporting Esmet and the 200 Underbrush soldiers stationed in town.
