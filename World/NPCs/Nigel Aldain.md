> **Nigel Aldain** is the somewhat nervous curator of the [[Blakros Museum]] in [[Absalom|Absaloms]] [[Wise Quarter]]. Nigel recently used an [[Artifact|artifact]] known as a *shadow obelisk* to transform the interior of the Blakros Museum, so that it is now larger on the inside than on the outside. Nigel also maintains the [[Collection Esoterica]] within the museum, an assemblage of [[Psychic|psychic-related]] objects given to the [[Blakros family]].
