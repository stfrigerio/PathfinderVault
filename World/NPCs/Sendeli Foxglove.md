> **Sendeli Foxglove** is the owner of the Golden Serpent, a classic restaurant in the [[Ivy District]] of [[Absalom]]. Sendeli is a member of an aristocratic family from [[Magnimar]], but has not lived in western [[Varisia]] since tragedy struck the Foxgloves in [[4693 AR]]. Her mother [[Cyralie Foxglove|Cyralie]] went mad and burned down their manor's outbuilding, and attempted to set the house itself on fire. Her father [[Traver Foxglove|Traver]] threw Cyralie from the building's second story to her death on the jagged rocks below and then took his own life. After a short stint in a [[Magnimar|Magnimarian]] orphanage, Sendeli, her sister [[Zeeva Foxglove|Zeeva]], and brother [[Aldern Foxglove|Aldern]] were taken in by their father's second cousin and raised in [[Korvosa]].
