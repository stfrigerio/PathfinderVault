> **Kamdyn Arnefax** is an exiled [[Knight|knight]] from [[Andoran]]. He is a tall, muscular figure whose features suggest some [[Elf|elven]] blood. In [[4674 AR]] he appeared in the realm of [[Lambreth]], in the [[River Kingdoms]].


## History

> At that time, Lambreth was threatened by imminent invasion from neighbouring [[Razmiran]]. In desperation, the ruling council of three merchant families ([[Cullerton family|Cullertons]], [[Angelidis family|Angelidis]], and [[Vizcarra family|Viscarra]]) offered the lordship of the realm to Kamdyn Arnefax if he could defeat the invaders.
> Arnefax assembled an unlikely army of his household guards, Lambreth soldiers, refugees and infernal creatures, and launched a sneak attack on Razmiri forces. He won a great victory, which became known as the [[Moonlight Massacre]] of 26 Calistril, [[4675 AR]].
> The Council had not expected him to survive the battle. When [[Tandre Cullerton]] suggested a delay in recognising Arnefax's lordship, the victorious general killed him and his wife, and exiled his family.


## Ruler of Lambreth

> Since then, he has ruled Lambreth without mercy or compassion, surviving numerous assassination attempts and wreaking bloody vengeance on those who oppose him. 
> Arnefax rules Lambreth from the former Cullerton Manor in [[Maashinelle]]. His only two friends are a pair of [[Gnome|gnome]] siblings, [[Cenestin Maesner|Master Gardener Cenestin Maesner]] who is responsible for cultivating Lambreth's river blackberries into the labyrinthine [[Thornward]] and [[Nevet Maesner|Mistress of the Kennels Nevet Maesner]] who has tamed packs of [[Shadow mastiff|shadow mastiffs]] and [[Yeth hound|yeth hounds]] as guards and hunters. Arnefax's heavy armored horsemen, known as the feared [[Black Eagles]], roam the realm usually at night, collecting the taxes, enforcing the law, and defending the people. Arnefax makes frequent nocturnal visits to his borders riding a powerful [[Nightmare|nightmare]]. His people are terrified of his night riders and their [[Shadow mastiff|shadowy dogs]], but also proud that their ruler is powerful enough to keep the land free and safe.
