> **Haigen Topkick** is the Nomarch of the Puddles District Council in [[Absalom]] and also the captain of the [[Muckruckers]], the district guard, as well as the Guildmaster of the Salvage Guild. He usually can be found in the Muckrucker's headquarters, the [[Stilt House]].
> Haigen runs the Muckruckers into something of a thieves' guild, running what amounts to protection rackets among other activities. It is an open secret that businesses need to bribe him to be well-received in the [[Puddles]] and rumors also say that you can arrange for anything you need from Haigen, from [[Slavery|slaves]] to [[Recreational drugs of Golarion|illegal drugs]], for the right price.
