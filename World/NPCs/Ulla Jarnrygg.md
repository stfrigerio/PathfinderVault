> **Ulla Jarnrygg** is an [[Annis hag|annis hag]] with considerable [[Sorcerer|sorcerous]] powers. She claims to be the daughter of a [[Frost giant|frost giant]] jarl, and her [[Magic|magic]] reflects an icy heritage of some sort. In the heat of battle, she sometimes forgets about her magical powers, preferring to rip apart her enemies with tooth and claw.
> At one time she was a member of a coven in [[Irrisen]], but after a difference of opinion she left that land and established a lair in the [[Grungir Forest]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]].
> She has been seen in the company of frost giants and [[Ice troll|ice trolls]], and is often accompanied by a flock of [[Undead|undead]] crows. She hunts in the forest, and sometimes raids the steadings of the [[Ulfen]] folk of the nearby frozen marshes.

> She transforms herself into a tall Ulfen huntress when she is stalking men in the woods, and has also been known to take the forms of a [[Green hag|green hag]] or an [[Orc|orc]] when travelling.
