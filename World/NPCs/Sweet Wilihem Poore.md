> **Sweet Wilihem Poore** is the captain of the [[Ship|frigate]] *[[Red Courage]]* and one of the three [[Pirate|pirates]] who rule [[Firegrass Isle]] in the [[Shackles]]. Ill-tempered Wilihem is always chewing a stalk of sugarcane and terrorizes his crew members onboard. [[Thecla Dumeili]] is currently the temporary first mate of *Red Courage* after Wilihem left the last first mate, [[Palco Justice]], on [[Raptor Island]] to die. [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu]] [[Tepen the Quiet]], the carpenter, is the only member of the crew that escapes his captain's wrath, as Sweet Wilihem considers Tepen his "feathery good luck charm".
