> **Baroness Baelara** is the [[Jadwiga]] ruler of the small town of [[Atvan]] in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of [[Bleakmarch]]. Her biggest trouble is her husband [[Gregouri Urvalane]], a perpetual womanizer. Their fights grate on the town's peasants, and were the cause of the couple's expulsion from the court at [[Whitethrone]].
