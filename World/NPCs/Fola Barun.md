> **Fola Barun** is a [[Pathfinder Society]] [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] and negotiator who leads the [[Envoy's Alliance faction|Envoys Alliance faction]].


## Appearance

> Fola is a raven-haired, dark-skinned [[Half-elf|half-elf]] with silver tattoos on her face.


## Background

> Fola first encountered the Pathfinder Society in her role as the envoy of an [[Ekujae]] [[Elf|elven]] community in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] in [[4716 AR]], and later joined the Society through a field commission. She quickly established herself as an attentive leader whose even-keeled, professional approach not only expanded the Society's understanding of the mighty [[Vanji River]], but also helped devastate the [[Aspis Consortium]]'s predatory operations along that route. Having never trained at the [[Grand Lodge]] or absorbed the conventional Society wisdom imparted to initiates, she was appalled upon first reaching [[Absalom]] and learning of the many counts of negligence of the past century. She has brought a fresh approach to recruitment and supporting agents in the field, which often sees her collaborating (and occasionally clashing) with the [[Dean|deans]] of the Pathfinder Society's three schools.

 
 
> She eagerly participated in the Society's reforms of [[4719 AR]], and the [[Decemvirate]] granted her leadership of the new [[Envoy's Alliance faction|Envoys Alliance faction]] with the responsibility of regrowing the Society's ranks. She extended that mission to include taking care of active Pathfinders through continued training, [[Medicine|medicine]], and psychological treatment.
