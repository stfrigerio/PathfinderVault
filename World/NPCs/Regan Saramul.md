> **Regan Saramul** serves as the head curator of the [[Quarterfaux Archives]] in the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] capital of [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]]. Regan controls access to the vast store of archived material from the Royal Collection and typically only grants access to members of the aristocracy. Still there are some items so strictly controlled that even the aristocratic patrons of the Quarterfaux Archives can only gain access with Regan's explicit permission.
