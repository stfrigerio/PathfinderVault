> **Ruthazek** is the current [[Gorilla King]] of [[Usaro]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. Like all his predecessors, he was found worthy to rule by the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Angazhan]]. He was once [[Human|human]], but (as with all Gorilla Kings) he presented himself at Angazhan's totem, and was found worthy to be killed and reincarnated as a [[Ape|great ape]]—in his case, a [[Dire ape|dire ape]].
> His strength and combat prowess are formidable, but he also rules Usaro with considerable cunning and ruthlessness, encouraging his simian subordinates to compete violently amongst themselves to ensure they prevent each other from challenging for his position. Ruthazek has begun training wild [[Ngoga|ngoga]] as ferocious mounts for his followers to use.
