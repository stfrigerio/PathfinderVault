> The **head of Lecit Ghazts** is all that remains of this erstwhile officer of the [[Knight|knights]] of [[Barstoi]]. This [[Undead|undead]] remnant rolls around the vast wasteland called [[The Furrows]] created at the end of the [[War Without Rivals]]. While spurred on by greed, the unchivalrous Ghazts robbed noble houses around the battlefields including an attempt on the [[House of Ensland]]. There he met a [[Devil|devil]] who played cards with him; Ghazts lost the game and his body. His quest today is to find his body or someone else's.
