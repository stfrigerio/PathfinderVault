> **Jhavhul** is an [[Efreeti|efreeti prince]] who traveled to the [[Material Plane]] in order to impress his cruel mistress, [[Ymeri|Ymeri Elemental Queen of the Inferno]]. He was captured by a wizard-priest named Ezer Hazzebaim, who used him in his search for the corpse of [[Xotani|Xotani the Firebleeder]], one of the monstrous [[Spawn of Rovagug]]. Jhavhul managed to extricate himself from the control of the wizard-priest, and Ezer escaped to the [[Plane of Fire]]. Jhavhul continued to search of his former master, hoping to take on Xotani's traits and impress Ymeri. Jhavhul located the Firebleeder's immense remains beneath the [[Brazen Peaks]]. To accomplish the transformation he needed 1,000 wishes from the mouths of mortals, and so became a ruler of a temple devoted to [[Rovagug]], a place that now is known as the [[House of the Beast]]. Jhavhul's wishes fractured reality to such an extent that they attracted the attention of the [[Djinni|djinni]] princess [[Nefeshti]]. She sent her forces, led by the [[Templars of the Five Winds]], to trap Jhavhul and his minions in a forgotten demiplane in [[4300 AR]].
