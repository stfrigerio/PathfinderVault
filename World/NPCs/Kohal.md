> **Kohal** was an [[Angel|angelic]] [[Herald|herald]] of [[Sarenrae]] who was destroyed by the inhabitants of the [[Ninshabur|Ninshaburian]] city of [[Gormuz]] in [[-3923 AR]].


## History

> Sarenrae had sent Kohal as a final warning to leave the city, as it had become thoroughly corrupted by the dreams and emanations coming from the [[Dead Vault]], the prison holding [[Rovagug]] over which the city had been built. When its corrupted citizens turned on the herald and destroyed him, the [[Deity|goddess]] smote the city with her [[Scimitar|scimitar]], destroying it utterly and tearing a deep gash in the earth that became known as the [[Pit of Gormuz]]. Kohal's corpse fell into the newly-created Pit but was resurrected a century later by Rovagug who transformed him into a twisted abomination made of molten lava.


## Kohal today

> Kohal now resides in the Court of Fallen Righteousness, a jagged spire jutting from the south wall of the Pit of Gormuz, with a group of equally [[Insane|insane]] followers of Rovagug. The imprisoned god constantly whispers into his mind of his past as a herald and Kohal plots numerous plans to invade [[Nirvana]] to take revenge on Sarenrae, but he and his minions are too disorganised to act on these plans. Redeeming and restoring Kohal is practically impossible, but such an act would be a major blow to the Rough Beast.
