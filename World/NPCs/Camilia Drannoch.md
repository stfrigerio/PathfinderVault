> **Camilia Drannoch** is the incumbent Chairwoman of the [[Revolutionary Council]] in [[Galt]]. Determined to bring back Galt's potential, she secretly seeks to purge the [[Gray Gardeners]], end the [[Red Revolution]], and get rid of the *[[Nethys/Artifacts/Final Blade|final blades]]*.



## Appearance

> Camilia always wears a polished steel choker and a red scarf to remind herself of Galt's troubles and the trouble paid by her family.


## Relatives

> Camilia grew up in [[Iadara]] where her mother Apalma served as Galt's ambassador to [[Kyonin]]. When the family returned home, Apalma was arrested by the Gray Gardeners as soon as they crossed the border, then dragged through the streets of [[Isarn]] and executed by the *final blade* *Silence*.


## Associates

> Camilia's web of assets extend throughout and beyond Galt. Her allies are rewarded with prestige and power, while her foes tend to find themselves assassinated or lynched. Believing that outdated ideologies across [[Golarion]] will soon be discredited, Camilia openly supports and sends agents to aid rebels in [[Vidrian]] and [[Ravounel]].
> Camilia's care for the [[Soul|souls]] imprisoned in the *final blades* has led her to seek [[Geb (person)|Geb]] as an ally, offering intelligence on [[Nex]] and the [[Spire of Nex]] so he would free the trapped souls, allowing them to continue existing in [[Geb's Rest]] or pass onto the [[River of Souls|afterlife]]. Geb has begun to consider Camilia's offer due to his lack of living spies to infiltrate Nex.
> Camilia has entered a clandestine alliance with [[Andira Marusek]], who also wishes to get rid of the *final blades*. Knowing that Andira would balk at some unsavoury things she had to do, Camilia limits the flow of information to what she wants Andira to hear.
> [[Eutropia Stavian]] has offered friendship to the Revolutionary Council, while Camilia believes that Eutropia is holding back, and seeks to radicalise her so Eutropia can realise the true potential of [[Taldor]].
> Camilia never fell in love with the country of her birth, and sees [[Telandia Edasseril]], who is reluctant to align Kyonin with any cause, as an obstacle. Some of her detractors have begun to refer to her and the female leaders of neighbouring countries as the 'Four Queens'.


## Background

> During her childhood in Kyonin, Camilia proved to have an unusually sharp mind. After her mother's death, which introduced her to Galt, Camilia entered politics, and quickly gained a following with her passionate words and radicalism. After making a speech questioning the Gray Gardeners next to *Silence*, Camilia was kidnapped under the full [[Moon|moon]], a black bag covering her head; the kidnappers promised to reunite her with her mother.
> Fifteen years later, with her old foes all dead, Camilia reappeared in Isarn. She became a household name and earned a seat on the Revolutionary Council by exposing the [[Eye of Law]] as a [[Hag|hag]] coven. Since then, she has survived multiple coups, and became Chairwoman when her predecessor [[Korran Goss]] was torn apart by an angry mob. She enacted several popular reforms to bring back some stability, notably putting an end to xenophobic policies and improving foreign relations.
