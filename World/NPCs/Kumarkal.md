> **Maharajah Kumarkal** was a ruler of the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]], descended from the first maharajah [[Khiben-Sald]]. Maharajah Kumarkal is best remembered for his efforts to establish closer ties with the distant continent of [[Tian Xia]] in [[2187 AR]] and, as a result, spreading the faith of [[Irori]] from Vudra to Tian Xia.
