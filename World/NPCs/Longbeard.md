> **Longbeard** is the ruler of [[Mezdrubal]], a southwestern settlement on [[Devil's Arches|Devils Arches]] island in the [[Shackles]]. He is a petty buccaneer who resents paying his tribute to [[Hell Harbor]] that is demanded at the beginning of each month. Longbeard, though, could never contemplate refusing to pay his tribute and he usually takes out his frustration on the poor victims of his cruel and often arbitrary judgement. Mezdrubal's ruler is also known for his love of fine clothing and jewelry and many [[Pirate|pirate]] vessels head to his town to sell such wares to Longbeard.
