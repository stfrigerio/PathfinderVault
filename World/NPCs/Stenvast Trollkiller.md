> **Stenvast Trollkiller** is a young [[httpenwikipediaorghuscarl|huscarl]] [[Blackravens|Blackraven]] who is second-in-command to [[Freyr Darkwine]], and is stationed at [[Blackraven Hall]] in the eastern [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Hagreach]]. Unlike his more defense-minded commander, Trollkiller wishes nothing more than to launch an invasion of [[Irrisen]] and retake the lands lost during the [[Winter War]] over a millennium ago.
