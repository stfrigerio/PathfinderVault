> **Lokoa** is one of the three Sky Masters who has been ruling [[Yjae]] since the fall of the [[Shory Empire]] alongside [[Shebe]] and [[Musafti]], and is arguably the wisest and most powerful of them. His long-limbed, physically perfect body is clad in a white loincloth, a smooth ivory mask, and matching gauntlets. He never removes his gauntlets and mask, which are speculated by some of his followers to be replacements of his hands and face, which were destroyed and cannot be restored even by the greatest [[Medicine|healers]]. Lokoa is a rival of Shebe, as she blames Lokoa for having insisted on navigating Yjae through the [[Wall of Heaven]], in the process causing a crash that is the source of the city's present woes. He is often supported by Musafti, whose romantic advances towards Shebe have long been rebuffed.
