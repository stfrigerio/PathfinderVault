> The [[Half-succubus|half-succubus]] [[Witch|witch]] **Areelu Vorlesh** was one of the most powerful denizens of the land known as the [[Worldwound]]. She was best known for having aided the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Deskari]] in opening the [[Worldwound]] in [[4606 AR]], shortly after her transformation into a [[Half-fiend|half-fiend]]. She had a reputation for conducting vile experiments on those who displeased or interested her in some manner. Since the closing of the Worldwound at the end of the [[Fifth Mendevian Crusade]] in [[4718 AR]], her current fate remains unknown.


## Associates

> Areelu served as Deskari's mouth in the Worldwound. Many of the Worldwound's other leaders were jealous of her position, which granted her great protection and leeway to pursue whichever goals she wanted.


## Background

> In [[4600 AR]], when imprisoned in the tower of [[Threshold]] for the crime of using [[Arcane magic|arcane magic]], Areelu discovered a strange thinness between [[Sarkoris]] and the [[Rasping Rifts]], Deskari's [[Abyssal realm]]. She contacted Deskari and pledged her allegiance to him in exchange for aid in destroying the land that had betrayed her. She recruited two fellow prisoners, Opon and Wivver Noclan, under the false promise of helping them escape. However, these two managed to discover that their [[Portal|portals]] led to the Rasping Rifts and undid their [[Magic|magic]], forcing Areelu to cast them into the final closing portal.
> For the next six years, Areelu and Deskari laboured to reopen the gates. In [[4602 AR]], a horde of tiny [[Demon|demons]] emerged, overwhelmed the Threshold, killed the wardens, and allowed Areelu to convert many prisoners to Deskari's cult. In [[4606 AR]], emboldened by the death of his old enemy [[Aroden]], Deskari threw open the portal to create the Worldwound.
