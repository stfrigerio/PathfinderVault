> **Hego Gebel** was the most famous [[Pirate|pirate]] who took the Fellhope Run challenge in the [[Shackles]] and lived to tell the tale. The now one-eyed, one-legged [[Half-orc|half-orc]] sailor can be found in the common room of the [[Lusty Mermaid]] in [[Quent]] narrating the story for newcomers who buy him a drink. Most of his compatriots were not as fortunate and were eaten or eviscerated along that journey. Given the right inducement, Hego may share his secrets about successfully navigating the canyon.
