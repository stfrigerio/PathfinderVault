> **General Porthmos** was the leader of [[Taldor]]'s semi-legendary [[Army of Exploration|First Army of Exploration]] which destroyed [[Goroth Lodge]] in [[37 AR]] and mapped the [[Sellen River]] as far as the [[Elf|elven]] sanctuary of [[Sevenarches]] in the modern-day [[River Kingdoms]].


## Legacy

> The general is still one of the most famous men in Taldor's long history, as evidenced by the countless places which have been named after him. These include the [[Porthmos River]], Taldor's central waterway which flows past the capital, [[Oppara]], the [[Porthmos Gap]] between the northern and southern range of the [[World's Edge Mountains|Worlds Edge Mountains]], the [[Statue Garden of Porthmos]] in Oppara, and [[Porthmos Prefecture]] and [[Porthmos Prison]] in eastern Taldor.
