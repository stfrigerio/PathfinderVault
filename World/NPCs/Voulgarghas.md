> The [[Gelugon|gelugon]] **Voulgarghas** helped the founder of the [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]], [[Daidian Ruel|Lictor Daidian Ruel]], search for information on retrieving his [[Eris Ruel|sons]] soul from [[Avernus]], the first circle of [[Hell]]. The ice devil thereby drew Daidian deeper into corruption and strengthened infernal influence over the entire organization.
> The Hellknights remain ignorant of Daidian's fate, and while many [[World/Culture/Titles & Kings/Hellknight signifer|Hellknight signifers]] summon Voulgarghas out of the accurate belief that the ice devil knows Ruel's fate, Voulgarghas has continued to keep it secret.
