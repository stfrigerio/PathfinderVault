> **Horus Ilaktya** is the most well-known (and powerful) [[Necromancer|necromancer]] of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]].  Although he may at first glance appear to only be a small shop owner in the [[Ankar-Te]] [[Ring district]], he is actually one of that neighborhood's political leaders.  He creates mindless undead, which serve him and his clients as menial laborers.
> Horus is the proprietor of [[Last Rites]], a business where he sells mindless undead to serve as servants and mounts throughout the city.  To give the owners' control over their otherwise evil and homicidal minions, he has created a special medallion known as a [[Death's head talisman|deaths head talisman]].  These magical amulets allow the wearer to control their undead property.
> Because of the nature of his store, Horus is always in need of fresh bodies, and many of the city's poorest earn much-needed cash by selling their loved-ones to him.  So as not to encourage grave-robbing, he makes sure that the sold cadavers have the highest provenance.
