> **Lord Ganfen of House Kethlin** is described as a man of small stature, with thinning hair and large ears. As master of blades, he is in charge of arranging the [[Irorium]]'s daily performances and most daily operations. Despite his position within the Irorium, he does not give the impression of being a warrior, a fact he gladly admits to, and rightfully believes himself better suited to brokering deals and commerce, more as an administrator.
> Lord Ganfen maintains a few offices and meeting rooms under the north end of the arena where he enacts most of the business of running the Irorium.
> As part of his duties as Master of Blades, Ganfen presents awards to competitors who prove themselves in the arena.
