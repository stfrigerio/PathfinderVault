> [[Orc]] legends refer to a truly enormous [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakelike]] or [[Squid|squidlike]] creature that haunts the center of the [[Dirt Sea]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. They call it **Old Hegrith** but the beast has not been seen in over a century. Most orcs do not believe that the legendary creature exists. The truth is that Old Hegrith is a [[Mother of Oblivion]] summoned by a powerful priestess of [[Lamashtu]] during the [[Age of Darkness]]. The creature has lived in a cavern under the Sea. Having fulfilled her original purpose, Old Hegrith now spends most of her time in hibernation.
