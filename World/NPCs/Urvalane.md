> **Urvalane** is a daughter of [[Baba Yaga]]. She was the third Queen of [[Irrisen]]. She reigned from [[3513 AR]] until [[3613 AR]], when she was removed from [[Golarion]] and her sister [[Pjallarane]] was placed on the throne.
> Queen Urvalane called a halt to the aggressive war being waged by Irrisen on its neighbours, preferring instead to concentrate resources on building up the country's internal power and infrastructure. As part of this process she created a new province, the [[Verge]], out of part of [[Wintercrux]].
