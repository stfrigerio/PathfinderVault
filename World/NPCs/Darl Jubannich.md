> **Darl Jubannich** was a [[Galt|Galtan]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] who wrote the broadsheets *[[On Government]]* in [[4662 AR]], a radical manifesto that exposed the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] government's betrayal of [[Human|humanity]], and undermined the divine right of kings. Instantly popular among the dissatisfied masses, the manifesto inspired the [[Red Revolution]] in Galt in [[4667 AR]], as well as the growing movement for [[Andoren]] independence which resulted to the [[People's Revolt|Peoples Revolt]] in [[4669 AR]]. After the Chelish-backed government of Galt tumbled, Jubannich, together with the revolutionary philosopher [[Hosetter]] formed the [[Revolutionary Council]] to run the country. Even though they had the loftiest goals for Galt, the Revolutionary Council quickly spun out of control, becoming paranoid and tyrannical, and executing anyone who dared oppose its authority. The council soon collapsed, replaced by newer and even more radical revolutionaries. Hosetter was executed by one of the *[[Nethys/Artifacts/Final Blade|final blade]]* guillotines he had commissioned, while Jubannich fled for his life to Andoran.
> Popular history holds that the [[Avoral|avoral]] [[Talmandor]] saw the great [[Evil|evil]] of [[House Thrune]] rising in Cheliax and dictated the words that Darl Jubannich wrote in his famous manifesto.


## Other writing

 
 A copy of *[[The Alchymical Wedding|The Alchymical Wedding A Masque of Allegory]]*, by Darl Jubannich.
> Even though Jubannich is best remembered for his political manifesto, *On Government*, he was also a poet and allegorist.
> He frequently wrote of [[Thais]], the [[Herald|herald]] of [[Cayden Cailean]], whom he referred to as Cerulean Liberty. Jubannich said that her blue wings symbolized skies cleared by the sacrifices of the revolutionary martyrs. He also authored *[[The Alchymical Wedding|The Alchymical Wedding A Masque of Allegory]]*, a parable that uses the metaphor of a royal wedding to make points about both philosophy and [[Alchemy|alchemy]].
