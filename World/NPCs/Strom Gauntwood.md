> **Sergeant Strom Gauntwood** was the founder of the [[Castle Everstand]] in [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], an unusual fortification that his descendants still command.


## History

> When [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]]'s defensive barricade, known as the [[Hordeline]], fell in [[4517 AR]] [[Rader-Seve|Watcher-Lord Rader-Seve]] abandoned the line and drew a new one not far west of the [[Kestrel River]] and [[Ghostlight Marsh]]. On the evening of 17 [[Arodus]], at the point where the [[Voulge Bridge]] crosses the Kestrel River, 400 [[Orc|orc]] berserkers under the command of [[Haskodar tribe|Haskodar]] Warpriest Tulkuk-Thruul were ready to descend upon Sergeant Strom and 40 of his soldiers the following morning. In the night, Strom and his soldiers using their only hope, a *deck of many things*, rose a solid stone keep out of the rocky bluff adjacent to the bridge. Strom and his soldiers fought and held their position long enough for the Lastwall's heavy cavalry to arrive. Sergeant Strom went on to the [[Crusader War College|War College]] of [[Vigil]], where his bravery earned him praise, admiration, and a larger command.


## Legacy

> Strom's daughter [[Hale Gauntwood]] was appointed commander of the Everstand in [[4533 AR]]. Command of the castle has been granted to the [[Gauntwood family|Gauntwood lineage]] ever since.
