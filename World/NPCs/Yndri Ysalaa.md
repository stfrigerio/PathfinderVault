> **Yndri Ysalaa, the White Mage** is the most powerful resident of the Mages' Quarter in the [[City of Brass]]. She is said to live entirely on the blood of [[Slavery|slaves]] and spends most of her nights satisfying her ravenous appetite for [[Mortality|mortal]] lovers, who usually die in the process. Despite her open violations of the city's laws, Ysalaa has never been punished; this is speculated to be her reward as creator of the wards that protect the Mages' Quarter from intruders.
