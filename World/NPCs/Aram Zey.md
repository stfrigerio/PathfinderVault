> **Aram Zey** formerly held the prestigious title of the [[Pathfinder Society|Pathfinder Societys]] [[Master of Spells]] of the [[Grand Lodge]] in [[Absalom]], despite his constant belittling of every student he taught there.



## Appearance

> Aram is a middle aged man of thin stature with disdain written across his features.


## History

> He grew to fame in his youth for his radical, some say blasphemous, theories regarding the fundamental nature of [[Magic|magic]]. Aram originally joined the Society only to gain access to its vast libraries but later went on to make major discoveries in [[Geb's Rest]] and [[Nex]]. Aram was eventually promoted to Master of Spells (some say against his will), replacing [[Sorrina Westyr]] in [[4709 AR]], where he became a vocal critic of every student he had taught. Aram was especially mean towards those without any magical talent, unfortunately part of his role involved teaching every Pathfinder, even the most magically inept, how to safely handle [[Magic item|magic items]] and identify types of [[Spell|spells]]. Despite his seeming loathing of many of his students, he continued to accept his position for many years.


## Death

> Zey was lost to the magic of the extradimensional demiplane known as the Hao Jin Tapestry and is presumed dead. Zey's demise was not in vain however, as his sacrifice helped stabilize the demiplane and save many lives.
> He was subsequently (and perhaps ironically) replaced as Master of Spells by his predecessor [[Sorrina Westyr]]
