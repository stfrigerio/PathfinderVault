> **Mogaru**, known as the **Final King** by [[Kaiju|kaiju]] scholars and simply **King Mogaru** by others, is a massive, twin-tailed [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|saurian]] kaiju who slumbers in the [[Valashmai Jungle]] of [[Tian Xia]].


## Appearance

> Mogaru is a 140-foot-tall, 20,000-ton beast that resembles a bipedal dinosaur. It has two tails and measures nearly 300 feet long from tail to nose.


## Background

> Mogaru's origins are unknown. He is best known for slaying the kaiju [[Agmazar|Agmazar the Star Titan]] of [[Verces]] after it crashed into the Valashmai Jungle in [[-44 AR]]. The site of this battle is known as the [[Star Titan's Grave|Star Titans Grave]], where the now-undead Agmazar still roams.
> Mogaru subsequently returned to its slumber at the bottom of a deep, unknown lake within the jungle.
