> **Zusgut** is the leader of the [[Crookedtoes|Crookedtoes goblin tribe]] in the [[Puddles]] district and the self-styled Goblin King of [[Absalom]]. He earned the position of chief by leading his people from the doomed lands of southern [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] to the safety of Absalom. The previous chief, [[Velkik]], remains his closest advisor to this day.


## Personality

> Zusgut is well respected for his leadership skills during the tribe's exodus fleeing from the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]]'s armies. Since relocating to the Puddles district in Absalom, Zusgut has shown to be energetic and full of love for the [[Art|arts]]. He feels he has a talent for writing plays and scripts but is frustrated by his people's disinterest towards theatre.


## Politics

> Recently, Zusgut has made inroads with the [[Pathfinder Society]], with him permitting the exploration of tunnels beneath the goblin tribe's new home by the Society. Furthermore, his decision to join the [[Muckruckers]] has had the effect of encouraging other goblins to follow suit. Interestingly, their noble—if sometimes calamitous—sacrifices in the line of duty have stirred a bit of faded pride in the district and in the Muckrucker organisation.
