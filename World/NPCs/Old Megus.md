> **Old Megus** the Swamp Witch has been living in [[Brinestump Marsh]] for decades since the foundation of [[Sandpoint]]. The fearful witch rarely left her home in the swamps to visit Sandpoint for certain supplies like glass flasks, strange alchemical reagents, and books from faraway places like [[Nex]] or [[Irrisen]]. Strange rat-like creatures have been seen kept hidden in her robes.
> Old Megus's Shack sits in a clearing at the southern part of the swamp and a trail called "Witch's Walk" is said that leads from the cliffs in the south directly to the house of the witch.
