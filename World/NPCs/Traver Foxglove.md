> **Traver Foxglove** was a member of the [[Magnimar]] aristocracy, a successful merchant with a bright future.


## Appearance

> Traver had many of the Foxglove family's prominent features, from his tall, thin figure to his narrow face. He often wore a mustache.


## History

> In [[4687 AR]], Traver moved his family into [[Foxglove Manor]], the family's ancestral home which had laid abandoned since his great-uncle [[Vorel Foxglove|Vorel]] and his family died of a mysterious disease over forty years earlier. Unfortunately, Traver was not immune to the influence of the house and his family fell to ruin in a similar fashion.
> Over the years, Traver often spent a lot of time in his private attic study at Foxglove Manor, poring over old accounts of safaris, expeditions, and the odd excerpt from the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]*. More and more his mind was filled with regret at the adventures he could have gone on and the missed opportunities caused by his domestic life. Convinced that the manor itself was causing her husband's reclusive tendencies and depression, his wife [[Cyralie Foxglove|Cyralie]] went into a fury and burned the nearby servant's quarters to the ground. When she attempted to set the house on fire as well, Traver pushed her out of the second story window to her death on the jagged rocks below. Realizing what he had done, Foxglove proceeded into their master bedroom and slit his own throat. The couple's three orphaned children, [[Zeeva Foxglove|Zeeva]], [[Sendeli Foxglove|Sendeli]] and [[Aldern Foxglove|Aldern]], were later raised by a distant cousin in [[Korvosa]].
