> **Wynsal Starborn**, Acting [[Primarch]] of [[Absalom]] as of [[4719 AR]], and former Siege Lord and captain of the city's [[First Guard]], is the caretaker in charge of the City at the Center of the World since the disappearance of [[Gyr of House Gixx|Lord Gyr of House Gixx]].



## Appearance

 
 Wynsal Starborn.
> Wynsal Starborn is dark-skinned [[Human|human]] with braided black hair and a small black beard. Despite being well past middle age, he maintains a strong physique.


## Relatives

> Born to an affluent family in [[Eastgate]] to well-connected parents, Wynsal Starborn surprised them by focusing on the military rather than mercantile concerns.


## Associates

> - First Siege Gear [[Chun Hye Seung]]: childhood friend and associate from the First Guard.
> - [[Harlo Doleen]]: Starborn's assistant, former adjutant and lifelong friend.

## Background

> Although initially dismayed at their son's interests, his family decided to send him to an expensive military school in Eastgate in which he excelled. He graduated with honors and joined the [[First Guard]] in which he quickly climbed through the ranks to become Captain of the First Guard and Commander Militant of Absalom at the age of thirty.


### As Azlanti Keep representative

> Starborn retired from the First Guard in 4701 AR, instead immersing himself in politics. He soon held the [[Azlanti Keep]] district seat on the [[Grand Council]].


### As Siege Lord

> Starborn was named Siege Lord in [[4717 AR]] by the High Council during the [[Fiendflesh Siege]] of Absalom, wherein he released any of the city's [[Slaves|slaves]] from servitude in exchange for their help in defense of the city, drawing the ire of the city's slavers. He delegated the mandate's announcement to the [[Pathfinder Society]]. The Grand Council subsequently ended the [[Flesh Tax]] and abolished [[Slavery|slavery]] in the city.


### As Acting Primarch

> Starborn has initiated expeditions into the [[Precipice Quarter]] to reclaim it from years of abandonment that had turned it into ruins overrun with crime and monsters. This included suggesting to [[Ulthun II]], the former [[Watcher-Lord]] of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] with whom Starborn has also struck a friendship over their common military experience, that the remaining Shining Sentinels establish an embassy there. Starborn also sealed the deal for the district to become the site of the [[4720 AR]] Radiant Festival and formed a committee to oversee its success.
