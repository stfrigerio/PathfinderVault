> **Erszebet Lavenza** is a gifted [[Wizard|wizard]] long fascinated with the [[Science|sciences]] of [[Alchemy|alchemy]], biology, and galvanism. She is the newest member of [[Galt]]'s [[Revolutionary Council]]. After studying at [[Oenopion Fleshforges|golemworks]] of [[Oenopion]] in [[Nex]], Erszebet started work as surgeon at the [[Torvin Academy]] in [[Edme]], which is now a well-known prison. She used the cadavers of condemned prisoners and managed to craft a [[Flesh golem|flesh golem]], impressing the Revolutionary Council. The Council ordered her to create more [[Golem|golems]] for the Revolution. By [[4710 AR]], Erszebet had completed three flesh golems, calling them Red Guardians. She has used body parts of criminals executed by Edme's guillotine, *[[Razor Jenni]]*, which had the unforeseen side effect that her golems have a much lower chance of going berserk, as the souls of the victims are trapped by Razor Jenni.
