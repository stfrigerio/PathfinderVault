> **Cousotta Shald** is the ruler of [[Neruma]], a trading post on the [[Port Peril and the Mainland|Mainland]] of the [[Shackles]]. She uses the profits from her position to increase her support within the [[Shackles]]' ruling [[Pirate Council]].
> It is rumoured that she has been keeping back more than her fair share of the trading profits. The Pirate Council would take a dim view of this, but their agents in the region, the mercenaries of the [[Steel Cordage]] are currently kept fully occupied by the recent [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] attacks on the town.
