## Alustriv:

- **Background**: Alustriv originates from the depths of the [[Plane of Water]], ruling over a realm in the darker, more saline depths. He has a long-standing history of conflict with the [[Kraken|krakens]] that inhabit the same depths. Due to his strength and strategic prowess, Alustriv has emerged victorious in many of these conflicts, establishing his dominance and reputation.
-   **Personality**: Alustriv is a brash and fiercely protective [[brine dragon]]. He has a quick temper and tends to act impulsively, especially when he perceives a threat to [[Promise]] or Mengkare's rule. He is known for his fiery speeches and displays of power, which instill fear in potential adversaries.
- **Appearance**: Alustriv is a gargantuan brine dragon whose physical presence exudes power and intensity. His sleek, sinewy body is covered in shimmering scales that range in shades of deep blue and green, resembling the depths of the ocean. Jagged spines and frills adorn his head, neck, and back, giving him a fearsome appearance. Alustriv's eyes are vibrant orbs of fiery orange, emanating an intimidating gaze that hints at his fiery nature.
-   **Motivation**: Alustriv genuinely believes in [[Mengkare]]'s vision for Promise and sees himself as the city's staunch defender. He takes his role as a security vizier seriously and dedicates himself to keeping [[Promise]] safe from external threats. However, he may struggle with doubts about Mengkare's methods, which could present an opportunity for the players to influence his loyalty.
-   **Interactions with Players**: Alustriv could be encountered during critical moments when the players face significant dangers or uncover hidden truths. He may initially be suspicious of the players' intentions but can be persuaded to assist them if they prove their loyalty to Promise or convince him that [[Mengkare]]'s rule is not as benevolent as it seems.

He may approach them discreetly, seeking their assistance in resolving delicate political situations, uncovering hidden agendas, or fostering alliances between Promise and other factions.
