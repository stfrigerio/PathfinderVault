## Relatives

> Born to Aneran and [[Porcia Victocora]], he was raised as a lady in Kintargo's noble circles until a meeting with a [[Shelyn|Shelynite]] tutor proficient in changing genders. This meeting inspired him to transition into a man through [[Alchemy|alchemical]] unguents which, even with his parents' support, resulted in scandal, ostracization, and threats.
> His parents have been missing and presumed dead since [[House Thrune]] attacked Kintargo during the [[Night of Ashes]] and burned his family's estate in [[The Greens]] in [[4715 AR]]. After witnessing the aftermath of the attack, he went into hiding in Kintargo.


## Associates
