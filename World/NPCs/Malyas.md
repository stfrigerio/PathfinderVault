> **Malyas** was a viciously powerful [[Kellid]] [[Vampire|vampire]] lord who served as one of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrants]] most-trusted lieutenants.



## Background


### Conquest of Ustalav

> During the Whispering Tyrant's rise to power in the 33rd century AR, Malyas was entrusted the conquest of northern [[Ustalav]]. North of the [[Senir River]], Malyas and his band of deathless raiders scourged the land. Countless thousands fell to his army's relentless march, whole towns were scoured and burned to ashes, and every burial place bolstered the [[Undead|undead]] war machine. Malyas subdued the north and then raised a black fortress at the loneliest edge of the [[Keldenwood]], naming it [[Castle Kronquist|Kronquist]].


### Realm of the Lich-King

> Malyas served the Whispering Tyrant throughout his reign, earning the reputation as his cruelest and most devoted general. The [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich-king]] granted him dominance over all vampires in his realm, but many of these arrogant undead refused to bow to him. In [[3220 AR]], Malyas waged a shadow war against these vampires and their progeny in a series of massacres remembered by vampirekind as the Blood Drought.


### Shining Crusade

> As the forces of the [[Shining Crusade]] gradually pushed deeper into Ustalav in the 39th century AR; they fought on multiple fronts against the Tyrant's generals. Malyas's armies in the north were among the most resolute and the vampire murdered two Shining Crusade generals sent against him: the [[Taldan]] [[Omorry Cheveith|Sir Omorry Cheveith]] and the [[Paladin|paladin]] [[Aenlyn Devvers]]. When [[Gallowspire]] fell, in [[38' AR]], Malyas was forced to retreat to Castle Kronquist. For nearly a year, the soldiers of the Shining Crusade besieged the castle, but they failed to breach its invulnerable walls. After the end of the war, a garrison was kept outside Kronquist, but after more than a century, the rulers of Ustalav judged that Malyas had somehow escaped, and decided to remove the garrison and leave the castle, and whatever survived within, to rot together.


### Malyas Today

> Since the Whispering Tyrant's defeat, Malyas has spent most of his time sleeping in Castle Kronquist, sometimes for centuries at once, leaving his army to rot and only briefly awakening to greet trespassers or look at the world outside his fortress. Nearby villagers speak of the tolling of the iron-horned clock tower on every [[Moon Golarion|full moon]].
