> **Angus Amberleg** was a notorious [[Pirate|pirate]] captain who raided across the [[Inner Sea]] in a [[Galley|galley]] some 300 years ago. He is credited with plundering a hundred ships, including a pair of corvettes from [[Taldor]]. Legend has it that he built a crypt somewhere in the jungle interior of [[Mediogalti Island]] to hold his vast treasure. This crypt became his last resting place—if he is indeed at rest; some report that the captain lingers as an [[Undead|undead]] guardian of his treasure.
