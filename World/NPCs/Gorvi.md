> **Gorvi** is the dung-sweeper of the town of [[Sandpoint]], and one of the community's few [[Half-orc|half-orc]] citizens. He's paid well for his work, and has even been able to hire over two dozen individuals to assist him in gathering garbage and overseeing [[Junker's Edge|Junkers Edge]]. Despite this, Gorvi chooses to live in a home that is both small and in need of repair.



## Appearance

> Gorvi is a heavyset individual and sports a multitude of tattoos. He further stands out among the citizens of Sandpoint as one of only a handful of half-orcs that call the community home.


## Personality

> Secure in his position as the town's dung-sweeper, Gorvi makes a habit of being a nuisance around town; he's convinced no one will take action against him as long as he does his job.


## Friends and Foes

> Gorvi's recent behavior along Sandpoint's boardwalk and at the [[Hagfish]] has brought the half-orc in increasing conflict with the town's mayor, [[Kendra Deverin]], who finds herself hard-pressed to keep the dung-sweeper's actions in check.


##### Gorvi's Boys

Numbering over two dozen, these troublemakers are paid by Gorvi to assist in keeping the streets of Sandpoint clean. They can often be seen hauling red wagons of garbage to Junker's Edge, where they add to the waste heaped on the beach below.

##### [[Hannah Velerin]]

Velerin is a follower of [[Gozreh]], and the primary opponent of the dumping practiced at Junker's Edge. As a result, she often stands against the methods employed by the dung-sweeper.
