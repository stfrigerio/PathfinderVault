> **Aluceda Zhol** was the high priestess of [[Zon-Kuthon]] in the temple of [[Shadowsquare]] in [[Kintargo]] during the final years of [[House Thrune|Thrune]] rule. Due to [[Zon-Kuthon|Zon-Kuthons]] lack of popularity in Kintargo, she led only a small congregation, and an equally small number of other priests, mostly [[Vampire|vampires]] that accompanied her from [[Nidal]]. She was the lover of [[Corinstian Grivenner]], the city's high priest of [[Asmodeus]]; what almost no gossips spoke of was her true dark secret, that she is in fact a [[Vampire|vampire]].
> In [[4715 AR]], after [[Barzillai Thrune]] was appointed lord-mayor of Kintargo, he recruited Aluceda to capture and transform his predecessor [[Jilia Bainilus]] into a vampire. Aluceda was eventually defeated by the [[Silver Ravens]], who had risen against Barzillai's tyranny.
