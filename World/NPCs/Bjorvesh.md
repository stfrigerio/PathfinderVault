> **Bjorvesh** was a visionary [[Frost giant|frost giant]] jarl who led a small contingent of his warriors into the [[Kellid]] realm of [[Sarkoris]] following the opening of the [[Worldwound]] in [[4606 AR]]. Upon arriving in the city of [[Dyinglight]] in the northwest of the country, he found that the [[Human|human]] population had fled, and quickly claimed the city as part of his jarldom. Their presence attracted the attention of a much larger clan of smaller [[Marsh giant|marsh giants]] from the nearby [[Frostmire Fen]], who attacked them and slew Bjorvesh and his men. As soon as his body hit the cold earth, the jarl rose from the dead and congratulated the marsh giants on their victory, but proclaimed that they had to found a new kingdom dedicated to the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Kostchtchie]]. The somewhat simple marsh giants fell to their knees and obeyed, interring the body of Bjorvesh in a place of honor where it is still presumed to lie today.
