> **Ethem Baler** is the Chief Shipwright of the [[Imperial Naval Shipyards]] in [[Cassomir]]. He is a white-haired ancient [[Gnome|gnome]], a [[Bleaching|bleaching]], with a reserved and sullen personality and an incredibly quiet voice, who seems to be interested only for the construction of ships. He always keeps the shipyards' production on schedule, ignoring people that could waste his time. He often works together with [[Zaganos|Brother Zaganos]] of the [[Wildwood Lodge]].
