> **Satrap Xerbystes II** rules the wealthy nation of [[Qadira]] in the name of [[Kalish XXII|Padishah Emperor Kalish XXII]] of [[Kelesh]]. Xerbystes is a quiet, brooding man. An only child, Xerbystes is in the unusual position of inheriting the position of [[Satrap|satrap]] without contest (partially because he has no siblings). In his bachelorhood, he turned away many Kelesh brides from the empire, as he fears such a union could threaten Qadira's independence from the Kelesh empire. As of [[4720 AR]], he was recently married to [[Deena al-Parishat]], a noblewoman from central Kelesh, due to threats of removal from his position.


## Desire for conquest

> Although restrained from declaring war by his Imperial Vizier, [[Hebizid Vraj]], Xerbystes is eager for conquest, and is feared in the region. He is additionally restrained by the fact that Qadira's generals answer only to the emperor. [[Taldor]] is by far his preferred target, but he is not adverse to expansion through other avenues. His battle lust has proven a considerable distraction from internal concerns, and he has begun to study the writings of Gheber III, hoping to discover a pretence for invasion that will not violate the ancient treaty signed with Taldor by his distant ancestor, [[Xerbystes I]]. Xerbystes therefore bides his time and takes out his frustration on his advisors, the Peerless, by assigning them tasks of ever-increasing complexity and difficulty.


## Tribute to Kelesh

> Xerbystes only rules Qadira as the representative of the Padishah Emperor, and must send him a yearly tribute of 13 golden bulls and 300 concubines for the pleasure palaces of Kelesh.
