> **Baroness Belcara Jarvis** is the head of the [[Kintargo|Kintargan]] aristocratic [[House Jarvis]] based at the Jarvis Estate in [[The Greens|the Greens]] district of [[Kintargo]]. Politically, her loyalties lie more with Kintargo than [[Cheliax]] and the ruling [[House Thrune]]. Her House is a member of the aristocratic [[Court of Coin]] and her House interests veer towards the construction industry, including city planning, architecture, carpentry, and stone masonry.
