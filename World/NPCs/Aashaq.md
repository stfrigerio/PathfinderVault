> The great wyrm [[Red dragon|red dragon]] **Aashaq** is a [[Cleric|priestess]] of the [[Dragon|draconic]] god [[Dahak]], and makes her home on the island of [[Dahak's Teeth|Dahaks Teeth]] in the [[Shackles]]. She has marauded the [[Inner Sea region]] for more than 700 years, her destruction drawing followers to her like a [[Cult of Dahak|cult]].


## History

> Aashaq has enjoyed 500 years of freedom, but twice in her early life she was subjugated and held captive: first caged in her youth, then experimented on by [[Fleshwarper|fleshwarpers]] nearly 200 years later. After breaking free, she burned a swath of destruction through the Inner Sea region in her devotion to Dahak the Sorrowmaker.


## Lair

***Main article: [[Sanctum of the Sorrowmaker]]***
> Aashaq lairs in the [[Sanctum of the Sorrowmaker]] in [[Dahak's Fang|Dahaks Fang]]. From this base in the [[Shackles]], she rules over the self-styled islands of Dahak's Teeth, which also include [[Dahak's Tooth|Dahaks Tooth]], [[Dahak's Horn|Dahaks Horn]], and the cult-infested town of [[Dragonsthrall]]. Aashaq prefers to collect [[Artifact|artifacts]] of doomed civilizations, as well as trapped souls and [[Curses of Golarion|cursed items]]. The chaotic region's [[Pirate|piracy]] provides her with useful cover and isolation, though she is quick to destroy any threats.
