> **Chuko** is a [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]] ex-[[Adventurer|adventurer]] and the owner and proprietor of [[War Cage|The War Cage]] in the [[Yolubilis Harbor]] area of [[Kintargo]]. Chuko is renowned for his dual love of adventurers and hatred of thieves though, as an ex-adventurer, he is aware that the line between the two is, at best, thin and quite often blurred. His hatred for thieves is commonly believed to stem from Chuko's animosity towards his brother, [[Ravzee]], leader of the local thieves' gang [[River Talons|The River Talons]]. He is close friends with the famous local [[Bard's End|bard]] [[Shensen]] whose disappearance during the [[KintargoHistory|Night of Ashes]] has left him feeling isolated and threatened by the increasingly tyrannical [[House Thrune|Thrune government]]. Paranoid, he has plotted escape routes from Kintargo in case of the worst. This fear has also made him sympathetic to local rebel groups like the [[Silver Ravens]].
