*For another meaning of "Silvermane", please see [[Sylvanna Orlovsky]].*
> **Silvermane** is a mute [[Elf|elven]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] who resides in the small town of [[Trunau]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. He quietly watches over the vital [[Hopespring]] within the town and its reservoir.
> He has resided on this hill and slept near the spring since before the town of Trunau was settled. He rarely communicates with anyone but is sometimes seen conversing with [[Halgra]] via a form of sign language. The few occasions upon which Silvermane performs [[Magic|magic]] — healing a dying child or calling lighting down on [[Orc|orc]] raiders — earn him respect from the grateful residents.
> A common rumor says that Silvermane is the only survivor of the [[Council of Thorns]], an ancient druidic circle whose members faced the unstoppable [[Orc|orc]] horde in [[4237 AR]] and martyred themselves to protect what is now the [[Ghostlight Marsh]].
