> **Count Geoff Tanessen** is the head of the [[Kintargo|Kintargan]] aristocratic [[House Tanessen]], one of the noble families that makes up the [[Court of Coin]]. Politically, Geoff Tanessen's loyalties lie more with [[House Thrune]], which rules [[Cheliax]], than with the rebellious city of Kintargo. His interests lie in [[Weapon|weapon]] manufacture, defense, and the Chelish military in general.
