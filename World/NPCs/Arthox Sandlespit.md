> **Arthox Sandlespit** was a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] inventor. He studied at the [[Egorian Academy]], but was expelled in his first year when one of his inventions burnt down one of its wings. He went on to work for a number of dubious patrons, making a number of enemies along the way, until he eventually joined the [[Aspis Consortium]] and relocated to [[Bloodcove]].
> He invented the [[Protean engine|protean engine]], which is used to power the Consortium's [[Ship|wheelboats]]. However, some of his old enemies caught up with him and burnt down his workshop – with him inside.
