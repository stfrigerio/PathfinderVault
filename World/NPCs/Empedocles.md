> **Empedocles** was a scholar from [[Earth]] who penned the *[[Book of Serpents Ash and Acorns]]*, a treatise about travel to the [[Dimension of Time]]. Details about his death in Earth's historical records are unclear, and he is said to have died in a [[Volcano|volcano]] that destroyed his homeland; in truth, he discovered a route to [[Stethelos]] and fled Earth, never to be seen again.
> In Stethelos, Empedocles came to understand the anima mundi and wrote the *Book of Serpents, Ash, and Acorns*, which he proceeded to cast into the Cataracts around Stethelos in hopes of letting his discoveries be known. Empedocles eventually succumbed to the call of the anima mundi and was transformed into it; his mossy remains can still be seen in Stethelos, and his final manuscript later fell to Earth in a [[Meteoroid|meteor]].
