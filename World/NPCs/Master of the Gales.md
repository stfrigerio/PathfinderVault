> The enigmatic [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] known as the **Master of the Gales** is a member of the [[Pirate Council]] of the [[Shackles]]. He is the ruler of the port of [[Drenchport]] and captains the [[Ship|xebec]] *[[Kraken ship|Kraken]]*. He perceives [[Piracy|piracy]] as a simple extension of natural predator-prey relationships, and himself as an apex predator in this environment.


## Background

> The precise origins of the Master of the Gales are not known, but most stories agree that he was born in the [[Sodden Lands]] during one of the powerful storms that characterize the region. He is rumored to have been raised among the [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[Koboto]] of [[Yamasa]], but as he responds furiously to mentions of the Koboto this has not been certified.
> The Master of the Gales eventually became a successful [[Pirate|pirate]] captain and the ruler of Drenchport, the primary settlement on [[Tempest Cay]]. He rules with a loose hand, and spends most of his time aboard his flagship *Kraken*.
> At one point, the Master embarked on a lone voyage south of the Shackles. When he returned, his ship was followed by a [[Giant squid|giant squid]] that has remained the Master's companion since.
> The Master of the Gales won the [[Free Captains' Regatta|Free Captains Regatta]] five straight times, from [[4707 AR]] to [[4711 AR]], and retired to judge the Regatta in [[4712 AR]].
