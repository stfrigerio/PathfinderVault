> **Count Aldus Aldon Canter** was a gentleman explorer and one-time Count of [[Vieland]] who founded the [[Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye]].
> He disappeared in the [[Parched Dunes]] in 3985 AR but reappeared in Vieland [[3988 AR|three years later]]. He claimed to have spent the intervening time studying the secrets of a group of [[Immortal|immortal]] sages and communing with their mentor, the fallen [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Angel|angel]] [[Tabris]]. He was then sent back into the world to pass on their message.
> Aldus attracted a following of young nobles to his new Order, and published his teachings as the *[[Lost Gospels of Tabris]]*. Controversy in [[Ustalav]] over the Order's activities eventually forced him to abdicate his title as Count, and Aldus disappeared again in [[4028 AR]], never to be seen again.
