> **Balazastar** is a yogi and sage responsible for much of our knowledge about the earliest history of ancient [[Vudra]]. It is said that he had these ancient histories dictated to him by the river goddess [[Likha]] herself, who told him the mythological tale of the goddess [[Vudravati]] and the jealous brothers, the two oceans [[Obari]] and [[Embaral]].
