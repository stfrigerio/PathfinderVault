> **Dusk Ronin** is a [[Star archon|star archon]] who is thought to be the daughter of the [[Deity|gods]] [[Shizuru]] and [[Tsukiyo]]. She was annoyed by the impact of her father's absences on her mother, until one day she struck Tsukiyo in anger and was exiled by Shizuru. Although she maintains a dedication to the ideals of [[Good|good]] and [[Law|law]], the Dusk Ronin is no longer welcome in her parents' realm and wanders the [[Great Beyond]] in search of redemption. She is known to help the [[Mortal|mortal]] faithful of her parents resolve issues of honor, duty, and redemption on [[Golarion]].
