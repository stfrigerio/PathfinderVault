> **Eando Kline** (pronounced ee-AN-do) is a renowned [[Pathfinder]] and leader of its [[Vigilant Seal faction]]. While distrustful of the [[Pathfinder Society]]'s [[Decemvirate|leadership]], he works within the organization to reform it while mentoring new members.



## Appearance

> Kline is a [[Taldan]] [[Human|human]] man with brown hair, a full beard, and a scar over his eye gained in a fight with his rival [[Arnois Belzig]].


## Background


### Early career and resignation

 
 
> Kline, under orders from [[Venture-Captain]] [[Shevala Iorae]] of [[Absalom]], spent much of [[4707 AR|4707]] and [[4708 AR]] traveling throughout [[Varisia]] and the [[Darklands]], following a mysterious [[Ioun stone|ioun stone]]. His adventure took him from [[Magnimar]] to [[Kaer Maga]], through [[Korvosa]] and the [[Cinderlands]], all the way to [[Urgir]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. There, Kline gained access to the Darklands, which eventually led him to a lost [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]] city. Fearing the discovery would be disastrous if revealed, Eando raced rival Pathfinder agent Arnois Belzig down the [[Sellen River]] to Absalom, hoping to prevent the location of the city from being published in the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]*. When his pleas failed to sway the stoic [[Decemvirate]], Kline resigned from the [[Pathfinder Society]]. His resignation in part inspired the creation of the reformist [[Shadow Lodge faction]] within the Society.


### Journeys and imprisonment

> In subsequent years he was spotted by Pathfinder field agents in the port city of [[Azir]] in [[Rahadoum]], and journeyed south from Absalom to [[Ilmurea]].

### Return to the Society

> Recent Society reforms and diplomatic outreach led to his conditional return in [[4719 AR]]. Kline demanded the ability to balance the Society's reform efforts by tempering its desires to explore and publish their findings, and was named the leader of its new Vigilant Seal faction toward those efforts.
> As part of this effort to rein in the Society's pursuit of potentially dangerous lore and [[Artifact|artifacts]], he is particularly interested in rumors of potentially reckless actions by the [[Grand Archive faction]] and its leader, [[Sorrina Westyr]].
