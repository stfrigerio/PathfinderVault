> **Thybidos** was the penultimate [[Runelord|runelord]] of wrath and ruler of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] realm of [[Bakrakhan]] before [[Earthfall]] from [[-5905 AR]] to [[-5779 AR]]. When he decided that he should be the ruler of Bakrakhan, he assassinated the incumbent runelord of wrath [[Xiren]] and succeeded her. He was in turn bested and killed by [[Alaznist]], a young [[Evoker|evoker]] given tremendous [[Magic|magical]] power through her pact with the [[Qlippoth lord|qlippoth lord]] [[Yamasoth]]. His wife and seven children were killed as well, while Alaznist bound his [[Undead|undead]] remains in [[Hollow Mountain]], caused all damage to him to instantly repair a moment later, and tasked two [[Ivory sentinel|ivory sentinels]] to repeatedly stab their [[Ranseur|ranseurs]] at his torso. Thybidos is not allowed to die and face judgement in the [[Boneyard]] until he apologises in person to Xiren, something that Alaznist believed that he could never do. Depictions of the runelord are quite rare, although one is said to exist in a room within the hollow piling of the [[Irespan]] called the Crow.
