> **Runewulf the Unbeliever** is the commander of the [[Graycloaks]], the district guard of [[Absalom|Absaloms]] [[Ascendant Court]]. A [[Human|human]] of [[Ulfen]] heritage, he is the cousin of the famous [[White Estrid]], king of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Halgrim]]. He is known as "the Unbeliever", due to his inability to believe in anything that he can't hear or see. This fact makes Runewulf an ideal choice for district guard captain for the Ascendant Court, as he cannot be accused of showing favor to any one of the countless religions practiced there.
