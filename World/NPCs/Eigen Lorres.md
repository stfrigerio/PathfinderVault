> **Count Eigen Lorres** was the unpopular ruler of the county of [[Tamrivena]] in [[Ustalav]]; he was one of the last noble rulers of that county before it became the modern day county of [[Canterwall]] under democratic rule. 
> The count is perhaps most famous as the founder of [[Harrowstone]] prison and its supporting town, [[Ravengro]], in [[4594 AR]]. He established the prison hoping to increase his standing in Tamrivena and beyond, while also providing a good income by taking in major criminals from all over Ustalav. The idea was a profitable success for the count and Ravengro town: Harrowstone soon became the home of Ustalav's most infamous prisoners. Inmates were collected twice-yearly from other prisons in every county to either spend the rest of their days there, or to be executed.
