> **Boiltongue** is a [[Crag linnorm|crag linnorm]] who was defeated in single combat by [[White Estrid]] in [[4704 AR]]. By this act, White Estrid became a controversial [[Linnorm King]], as all previous Linnorm Kings had killed their [[Linnorm|linnorm]] before claiming their crown. To preserve his life, Boiltongue exchanged it for servitude to White Estrid.
> Boiltongue now resides as a pet and as a powerful ally of White Estrid in the throne room of [[Halgrim]], the capital of the [[Ironbound Islands]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. Boiltongue is taciturn but confirms his defeat at White Estrid's hand to any who ask. He remains somewhat bitter about his hurt pride, but also acknowledges that Estrid gained a potent advantage in recruiting him, and even seems to enjoy protecting Halgrim and the Ironbound Islands.
> Once a year, typically after the harvest, Boiltongue leaves Halgrim to visit his mate and their children in their hidden lair in the [[Stormspear Mountains]].
