> **Doctor Beaurigmand Trice** is the [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] of the [[Vodavani Lodge]] in the city of [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]], [[Ustalav]]. This [[Pathfinder lodge]] is also an asylum (known as the [[Havenguard Asylum]]), with most of the patients being former [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]]. In the wake of [[Tar-Baphon]]'s assault on [[Avistan]] in [[4719 AR]], his [[Healing|healing]] services as a doctor are in such demand that he has given over management of the lodge to fellow Venture-Captain [[Evni Zongnoss]], whose lodge in [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] had been destroyed in the conflict.
