> The blond-haired sisters **Dagrun** and [[Narrika Lelkhammer]] are the current owners of the famous [[Drowned Dwarf]] tavern in [[Drenchport]]. They once sailed with [[Redbeard Sewk]], a famous [[Pirate|pirate]] in the [[Shackles]] who captained the *Gozreh's Knuckles* and made over the years a considerable fortune. The two sisters bought the Drowned Dwarf from their elderly cousin [[Peffen Stonebreaker]] in [[4710 AR]].
