> **Saoc** was a [[Rahadoum|Rahadoumi]] [[Astronomer|astronomer]]-[[Philosopher|philosopher]] who became a victim of the [[Oath Wars]] in his country. Two years after the establishment of the Rahadoumi [[Laws of Mortality]], in [[2557 AR]], he fled south with his followers through the [[Napsune Mountains]], and eventually settled in coastal western [[Garund]]. There, he was free to practice his profession and religion and established Saoc's New Paradigm to promote wider religious freedom. This settlement would eventually grow into the nation of [[Lirgen]].
