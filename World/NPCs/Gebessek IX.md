> **Gebessek IX** succeeded his mother [[Kamaria the Brazen]] as [[Pharaoh|pharaoh]] of [[Osirion]] following her assassination by a conspiracy of her children in [[159 AR]]. He is known as the Healer for his efforts in restoring the country following the depredations of his mother's reign.
> He buried his mother in the [[Pyramid of Kamaria]], fearing that she might rise as an [[Undead|undead]] if she was not properly honoured. The pyramid was then sealed off, in the hope that the evil contained within it would fall upon each other.
> Gebessek IX then slaughtered every cultist of [[Rovagug]] he could find, and the entire population of the city of [[An]] for good measure. He ruled for 22 years.
