> **Aspex the Even-Tongued** was the first king of independent [[Cheliax]]. He began as a [[Taldor|Taldan]] governor of the province of Cheliax in the 41st century AR. He consolidated the Taldan armies under his command, and declared Cheliax's independence from Taldor in [[4081 AR]].  He did this in the wake of a [[Qadira|Qadiran]] invasion of southern Taldor [[4079 AR|two years earlier]], knowing that Taldor would be unable to marshal any serious opposition so far to the west. His first act was to destroy the [[Taldan Phalanx]] in [[Westcrown]] at the Siege of Westcrown. In the following years he was able to annex the Taldan provinces of [[Galt]] and [[Isger]] by force, and convinced [[Andoran]] and the [[Strix|strix]] of [[Devil's Perch|Devils Perch]] to join his cause through diplomacy. He then marched his army to the western borders of Taldor, forcing the rulers there to sign a treaty recognising the independence of Cheliax. 
> This years-long conflict became known as the [[Even-Tongued Conquest]], as it was accomplished with relatively little bloodshed. He is celebrated in Cheliax annually on 14 [[Neth]], also known as [[Even-Tongued Day]], which commemorates the country's independence from Taldor and its gaining control of Andoran, Isger, and Galt.
