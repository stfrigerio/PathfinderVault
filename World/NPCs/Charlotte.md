Charlotte is a young, timid student at Promise Academy. She possesses a quiet demeanor, often seen clutching a worn journal filled with sketches and poetry. Here are some additional details about Charlotte and what she reveals to the party:

**Background**: Charlotte hails from a humble background, having grown up in the [[Beggar District]]. She secured a scholarship to attend [[Promise Academy]], and her passion for art and literature drove her to pursue her studies there. She is known for her imaginative and emotional artwork, often inspired by her own experiences and dreams.
    
**Personal Experiences**: Charlotte shares with the party her encounters with the ghostly apparitions. She describes seeing translucent figures wandering the halls, hearing faint whispers that send shivers down her spine, and experiencing unexplained cold drafts that make her skin crawl. These encounters have left her sleepless, anxious, and unable to focus on her studies.
    
**Artistic Clues**: Charlotte confides in the party that she has begun to incorporate the ghostly apparitions into her artwork, as if they are trying to communicate something to her. She shows them a recent painting or sketch that depicts a group of students in Promise Academy's courtyard, their expressions filled with sorrow and longing. She believes the spirits are trapped within the academy, desperately seeking solace or closure.
    
**Sensing Desperation**: Charlotte expresses her concern for the spirits, sensing their desperation and anguish. She explains that the haunting has intensified over the past few weeks, as if the spirits are growing more restless and agitated. She pleads with the party to uncover the truth behind their suffering and find a way to bring peace to both the spirits and the academy.
    
**Hidden Journal**: In a moment of trust, Charlotte shares her journal with the party. Its pages are filled with cryptic verses, scattered thoughts, and sketches that depict scenes from Promise Academy's past. The journal contains clues and fragmented memories that may aid the players in their investigation, providing leads to key locations or pivotal events connected to the restless spirits.
    

By involving Charlotte in the party's quest, they not only gain firsthand accounts of the haunting but also access to artistic interpretations and emotional insights that could prove invaluable in their efforts to appease the spirits and restore harmony to Promise Academy.
