> **General Erestos Marburran** led [[Taldor|Taldors]] ill-fated [[Sixth Army of Exploration]] at the end of the [[Absalom Reckoning|21st century AR]]. The army moved into [[Garund]] in [[2080 AR]], but was eventually ambushed and defeated by the forces of the [[Gorilla King]] at [[Nagisa]]. Historians generally think of this event as marking the beginning of Taldor's slow decline.
