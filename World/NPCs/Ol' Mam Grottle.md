> The owner and patron of the [[Magnimar|Magnimarian]] inn known as the [[Old Fang]], **Ol' Mam Grottle** is a well known local figure. The Old Fang is a popular local watering hole for the hardy sea folk of the [[Dockway]] district.  A big part of the establishment's appeal stems from Ol' Mam Grottle herself.  She is a burly, no-nonsense woman who has decorated her inn with nautical mementos of her late husband.
