> **Rader-Seve** was the [[Watcher-Lord]] of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] in [[4415 AR]] when the [[Hordeline]] fell. Rather than wage a fragmented and costly extended battle, Watcher-Lord Rader-Seve abandoned the line and draw a new one not far west of the [[Kestrel River]] and [[Ghostlight Marsh]].
