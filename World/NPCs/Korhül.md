> **Korh√ºl** is the second-in-command of Iolanthe and the public face of the [[Circle of Stones]].



## Appearance

> Korh√ºl is a bushy-bearded, deep-voiced man who often wears no shirt and an elaborate headdress that has earned him the nickname **Horned Man**.


## Associates

> Korh√ºl serves as the liaison between Iolanthe and other members of the Circle of Stones; a visitor who manages to fast-talk the common members must still convince him before being allowed to talk to Iolanthe. Since Iolanthe rarely leaves her sanctum, most citizens of [[Absalom]] know Korh√ºl as the cult's public face.
> When not attending to Iolanthe, he offers private sermons to fellow cult members or advocates for a simpler life. He particularly despises institutions that subjugate or kill [[Animal|animals]], like the Absalom Menagerie.
> In [[4717 AR]], Korh√ºl tapped a secret power source to create the [[Leaf leshy|leaf leshy]] Tumult Flower Flourish, who founded the [[Brattlebunch]], a [[Leshy|leshy]] gang that Korh√ºl employs to spy on key figures and harass enemies of both himself and the Circle of Stones as a whole.


## Background

> Korh√ºl and Iolanthe have begun to suspect that someone is leeching power from the [[Grand Holt]], their ancient tree, by attacking its root system from below. Following Iolanthe's order, Korh√ºl now bankrolls mapping projects under [[Eastgate]] to track down the culprit.
