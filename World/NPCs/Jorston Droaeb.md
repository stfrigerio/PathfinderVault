> **Jorston "Axetongue" Droaeb** holds the prestigious title of Master of Games at the [[Serpent's Run|Serpents Run]] arena in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]]. Despite his age, Jorston is still a sprightly fellow and has to be, as he is the person responsible for ensuring the various games that take place at Serpent's Run are all fair, a task he seems to have succeeded at.
