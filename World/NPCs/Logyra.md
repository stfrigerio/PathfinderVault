> **Logyra** was a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] princess of [[Jormurdun]] who fled after an invasion around [[1600 AR]]. She was one of four heirs to the throne entrusted with pieces of the [[Sky Key]] by her father, who was Jormurdun's last king.


## Background

> After fleeing with her Sky Key fragment, Logyra and her retinue traveled to [[Garund]] and joined the [[Pahmet]], a race of desert-dwelling dwarves of [[Osirion]]. They then joined the monastic [[Ouat]] in remote [[Tar Kuata]], where Logyra influenced their [[Philosophy|philosophical]] break from ancient dwarven traditions and inspired them to focus inwardly toward self-perfection.
