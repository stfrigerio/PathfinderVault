> **Jaydis Milon Malddis IV** is the scion of one of the three original founding members of the [[Aspis Consortium]], a nefarious trade corporation headquartered in the nation of [[Cheliax]]. As such, he is considered to be a member of the [[Patrons]], the group of board members and shareholders who control the Aspis Consortium. In truth, Malddis is a spoiled playboy who rarely interests himself in the running of his family's legacy.
> Malddis is one of the Patrons' two executive members, along with [[A X Adrius]], to whom Malddis is happy to cede the responsibility of running the Consortium's business dealings.
