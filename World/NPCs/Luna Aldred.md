> **Luna Aldred** is a [[Pathfinder]] who can fight equally with both weapons and spells. Luna came to [[Darkmoon Vale]] with her adventuring band, known as the Azure Guard, seeking wealth and fame, but ended up finding a place to live. They spent three months searching the [[Five Kings Mountains]] before Luna quit the Azure Guard and returned to [[Olfden]]. Unfortunately, the day she got back to the town was the Night of Silver Blood, and during the battle Luna single-handedly held back one section of the [[Werewolf|werewolves]] attacking the city just long enough for the town to defeat the rest of the lupine army, before succumbing to her wounds and expiring. Lissel, Olfden's high priest of [[Sarenrae]], raised the fallen hero from the dead on the next day as thanks for her selfless sacrifice. Her resurrection also had the unforeseen result of giving her some of the powers of the werewolves that slew her without losing her presence of mind.
> Luna later established a [[Pathfinder Society]] safe house in Olfden, called [[Silver Moon Sanctuary]] which also serves as an animal sanctuary. There is already a plaque dedicated to Luna where she stood and fell commemorating the event. A statue of her battling with the invading werewolves was also commissioned and now stands in front of the Lodge.
> Luna continues to offer support for Pathfinders operating in the area, often using her close friend Karlae Siegfrost's political position as well as her abilities as a [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] to assist whenever she can, though she considers herself in semi-retirement these days. She has been described as an older woman with startling yellow eyes. She still frequently leaves town to explore the region around Olfden, particularly the Five Kings Mountains range.
