> A decadent schemer with an insatiable lust for power, **Countess Carmilla Caliphvaso** is also a unmatched beauty.  At more than seventy years of age, she looks less than half that age and is known as the "Ruby of [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]]". She is a venomous critic of [[Aduard Ordranti III|Prince Aduard Ordranti III]] taking every opportunity to point out his (numerous) flaws, trying to undermine his authority and scheming to turn his people against him. Her criticism has become steadily more outspoken as her young charge [[Reneis Ordranti]] has grown to manhood. Reneis is the son of Millaera Caliphvaso and supposedly is the bastard son of the previous king [[Valislav Ordranti|Eunuch Prince Valislav Ordranti]]. Few doubt that Carmilla Caliphvaso plans to put her charge (and nephew) Reneis on the throne of [[Ustalav]]. There are darker rumours that she may plan to sit next to him, as she supposedly is involved in an incestuous relationship with him and eyes the title of princess covetously. She most often dwells in her [[Lethean Manor]] atop the [[Laurelight Hill]], though she is rumoured to host debauches of terrible decadence in her House's ancestral seat of [[Chateau Douleurs]].
