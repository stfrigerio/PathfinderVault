> **Barran Crumkin** was a former [[Abadar|Abadaran]] tax collector who decided to stay in [[Trunau]] when [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] abandoned the town. He saw his decision as his duty to promote civilization against the barbarians. He gathered other merchants in the town and founded the [[Trunau Countinghouse]] which served as a bank where the locals could safely deposit their wealth and earn interest instead of hiding it in their houses. The bank has grown into a large building that serves the banking operations as well as the spiritual needs of locals and traveling merchants. Its current owner is [[Lessie Crumkin]], a descendant of Barran Crumkin.
