> The [[Winterwight|winterwight]] **Dissayn** is a former follower of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] who escaped her master's defeat and now resides in the haunted [[Garden of Lead]] in southern [[Virlych]]. She spends her time there frolicking among the tortured spirits of the noblemen and women she killed hundreds of years ago. Dissayn enjoys her self-proclaimed noble status and fears the return of her former master, not wishing to be simply a servant again.
