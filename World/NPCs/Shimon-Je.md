> **Shimon-Je** is an abolitionist reviled across [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]] due to her repeated escapes from the city's [[Dungeon|dungeons]]. She is one of the few who know that Pactbroker [[Hashim ibn Sayyid]] is dead, murdered by the [[Veiled master|veiled master]] [[Olordaera]] who now walks the city in his guise, but has to be discreet in searching for allies lest the veiled master knows of her discovery. [[Pathfinder Society]] [[Venture-Captain]] [[Wulessa Yuul]], who also suspects a plot around Hashim, also pursues Shimon-Je in hopes of furthering her own investigation.
