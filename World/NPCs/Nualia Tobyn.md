> **Nualia Tobyn** was an [[Aasimar's Mercy|aasimar]] foundling raised by [[Ezakien Tobyn]], the head pastor for the [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of [[Sandpoint]]. She was recently found to have planned and executed a raid on the town by local [[Goblin|goblin]] tribes. Although these attacks failed, she was eventually tracked down to the island-fortress of [[Thistletop]], where she was defeated.
