> **Risa Magravi** ran [[Risa's Place|Risas Place]] in [[Sandpoint]] for its first 30 years. Since she has lost most of her sight, day-to-day operations have passed to her children, [[Besk Magravi|Besk]], [[Lanalee Magravi|Lanalee]], and [[Vodger Magravi|Vodger]]. Every night, Risa's dreams bring her to the [[Dreamlands]], where she parleys with the cats of Ulthar, dances with [[Naiad|naiads]] along the River Skai, and participates in candlelit balls under the [[Star|stars]] in [[Celephais]]. However, recently, she has been unable to dream: as she sleeps, she hears a soft voice that seduces her to go down the [[Darklands]], and when she wakes up, she only remembers one word: [[Ilvarandin]].
