## Background


### Life as a slave

> Trained as a sommelier, butler, and shopping assistant, the [[Halfling|halfling]] now known as Tamrin Credence spent his first 26 years as a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] [[Slave|slave]], albeit a well-treated one. When a [[Tiller|tiller]] (a member of the halfling liberation group called the Bellflower Network) infiltrated the estate and laid plans to lead a few halfling slaves to freedom, Tamrin made a counter-offer: he would create a distraction so the tiller could escape with twice as many [[Soul|souls]]. The plan worked, albeit at a cost. By the time the tiller returned to lead him out of [[Cheliax]], the halfling butler had received many scars for his deception.


### Freedom and Pathfinder Society career

> Tamrin Credence is a self-styled name that the halfling adopted in the decade since, both to distance him emotionally from his subjugated past and to create a new identity that would not lead to his recapture. He has continued to assist the Bellflower Network as a spy and supplier, often leading him into dangerous territory or treacherous relationships. Although he has infiltrated and worked with the [[Aspis Consortium]] and Cheliax's port authorities to this end, his most infamous rivalry is that with [[Zarta Dralneen]], whom he regularly undermined while she served Cheliax as that nation's liaison to the [[Pathfinder Society]]. Only once she fell from Cheliax's good graces, suffered unforgivable offences by her former allies, and sought refuge with the Society did the two agents begin finding common ground. They have now worked together on coordinating several missions, though years of thwarting each other's ambitions leave them prone to verbally sniping at each other over unresolved gripes they are yet to bury.


### With Liberty's Edge

> Tamrin's experience with the Liberty's Edge faction was modest, having only worked with [[Colson Maldris|Major Colson Maldris]] a few times before the former began more concerted collaboration in [[4716 AR|4716]] and [[4717 AR]]. Even so, he was a proud "liberator of [[Humanoid|humanoid]] assets" with criminal and business contacts in dozens of cities. What he lacks in faction experience, he makes up for in gutsiness, survivability, cunning, and a willingness to lead from the front as needed.


### As Bellflower liaison

> After the Liberty's Edge faction was retired with Society reforms in [[4719 AR]], Tamrin continued his work with the Society as its chief contact to the Bellflower Network. His most common collaborator in Society work is [[Karisa Starsight]], who had also worked with the Liberty's Edge faction.


## Personality

> Tamrin is a pragmatic individual who does not mind breaking a few unreasonable rules if he can mitigate the harm to innocent bystanders and maximize the benefit for oppressed people. He has witnessed the dark underbelly of several infamous operations first-hand, and he knows that no matter how seductive those groups might seem at times, they are ultimately immoral. These experiences have left him hardened against corruption, and he takes a more decisive stance on correcting the Liberty's Edge faction's embarrassing past misdeeds. He has strong Bellflower Network connections.


## Appearance

> Scars mark Tamrin's light-skinned face, and his brown hair bears a few streaks of gray. However, he mastered the arts of disguise and can change his appearance as it suits his needs.
