> **Mardeis Parastric** is not just the daughter of the powerful matron [[Astranovidova Parastric]], but is also her bodyguard and advertisement—Mardeis is not a [[Drow|drow]] like her mother, but a [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarped]] creation known as a [[Drider|drider]].
> [[House Parastric]], the [[Drow noble houses|noble house]] to which Mardeis belongs, are worshippers of [[Haagenti]], the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of alchemy and change, and thus specialise in the creation of monstrous beings that serve the drow. So dedicated to Haagenti was Mardeis's mother that she had Mardeis turned into a fleshwarped creature. Now she travels with Mardeis using her as both a bodyguard and as a demonstration of House Parastric's fleshwarped creatures, which they sell to other drow houses.
