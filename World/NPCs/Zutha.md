> **Zutha** (pronounced ZOO-tha) was the fifth and final [[Runelords|runelord of gluttony]] and ruler of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] domain of [[Gastash]], reigning from [[-5642 AR]] to the end of Thassilon in [[-5293 AR]].



## Appearance

 
 A portrait of the runelord Zutha.
> Zutha was an obese man, with bones visible in some places where his flesh had rotten away. Before [[Earthfall]], Zutha had already become a unique [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] that could taste, touch, and feel like a living [[Human|human]], but at a price. His undead body required constant renewal from stolen life energy. He attained this [[Undead|undead]] state to allow him to continue glutting himself on the produce of his rich kingdom.


## Personality and background

> Zutha became runelord of gluttony in [[-5642 AR]]. An apprentice of his predecessor [[Goparlis]], he took advantage of Goparlis' obsession with the theft of his [[Sword|sword]] to betray and replace him. Zutha then exchanged the corpse of Goparlis for the sword, which became known as *[[Ungarato]]* after the [[Graveknight|graveknight]] who originally stole it.
> It is said that Zutha never ate the same meal twice, constantly dining on exotic foods and "meal-slaves" from across [[Golarion]]. He was described as being mightier with the pen than the [[Sword|sword]] but this was not a slight against his skill at arms. Zutha sold Gastash's excess food to every domain in Thassilon, often selling to both sides in a war between rival runelords. Those who crossed Zutha soon found their supplies running very short. Zutha's favourite [[Weapon|weapon]] was a set of [[Ring|rings]] and *[[Ioun stone|ioun stones]]* that he could use in a unique way. He even favoured this above his scythe-like weapon of rule.


## Earthfall

> Like all of the runelords, Zutha divined Thassilon's impending fall and made contingencies to survive. Before the disaster struck, he constructed a towering monolith called the [[Cenotaph]] and buried himself beneath it. Further, he bound his essence into an eldritch book, the *[[Gluttonous Tome]]*, that was split into three volumes (the *Black Book*, *[[Bone Grimoire]]* and *Kardosian Codex*) and entrusted to his three greatest servants, instructing them to bring the pieces back once the dangers of [[Earthfall]] had passed. Thassilon's destruction was more complete than Zutha anticipated, however, and the three books were scattered to the farthest corners of [[Avistan]].
> As civilisation rebuilt in the following ages, many necromancers visited the Cenotaph in the hopes of claiming part of Zutha's might. The most infamous of these necromancers is undoubtedly [[Tar-Baphon]], better known as the Whispering Tyrant, who even managed to rise over Zutha in power.


## Recent events

> In [[4715 AR]], [[Varian Jeggare]] rebuilt the *Gluttonous Tome* under Zutha's influence, but Jeggare's companions [[Radovan Virholt]] and [[Eando Kline]] freed him from Zutha and together they defeated the risen runelord before he could properly reconstruct his body, and later scattered the *Gluttonous Tome* again. However, this brief return was enough for Zutha to re-establish a foothold in the world and for his influence to fester within all fragments.
> While the *Black Book* and the *Kardosian Codex* remained hidden, the *Bone Grimoire* fell into the hands of Leptonia, a [[Half-drow|half-drow]] [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Yamasoth]], who used it as payment for the service of the [[Dhampir|dhampir]] necromancer [[Erigantus]] in crafting the polymorph plague. Erigantus took the *Bone Grimoire* to [[Kaer Maga]] and studied it, all while Zutha's influence grew within its pages.
