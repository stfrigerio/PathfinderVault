> **Ergin Tock** is a brawny thug who took over the [[Sitting Duck]] tavern in [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] when its original proprietor, [[Larden Kried]], disappeared. A letter supposedly written by Larden "Ferret" Kried explained that he decided to return to the adventurous life. Tock produced a dubious deed to the Duck, which most claim was forged, but the deed was certified as genuine by [[Vamros Harg]]. Tock was formerly a hired muscle of [[Thuldrin Kreed]], so the townfolk realized that Thuldrin simply decided to put the Sitting Duck under his direct control. Tock and the lovely barmaid [[Jalene Artem]], report to Kreed every morning on the past night's events at the Duck.
