> **Kothas** is the founder and primary leader of the [[Seal-Breakers]], a nihilistic sect who seeks to unmake reality itself.


## Background

> Kothas once served as an advisor to the [[Wizard|wizard]]-king [[Geb (person)|Geb]], ruler of the [[Geb's Rest|nation]] named after himself. After Geb committed suicide but before he rose from the dead as a [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]], Kothas fled his master, taking with him the *Key of Geb*, a text that promised great power that would allow one to break the walls of reality.
> Kothas eventually came into the service of another wizard-king, [[Tar-Baphon]], and shared with him the secrets of the *Key of Geb*, which he saw as a way to attain [[Deity|divinity]] and rule over reality. After [[Aroden]] defeated his master, Kothas went into hiding with the *Key of Geb*.
> In [[3203 AR]], as Tar-Baphon returned as a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] known as the Whispering Tyrant and sought out the *Key of Geb*, Kothas came back to his master, seeing in him the means of destroying the world as prophesied in the ancient scroll.
> In [[38' AR]], when Kothas was away from his master on some mysterious errand, the Tyrant was defeated and imprisoned within his fortress [[Gallowspire]]. Kothas lost access to the *Key of Geb*, which was inside Gallowspire's vaults at the time. He quickly understood the nature of the seals protecting Gallowspire, and founded the Seal-Breakers, in order to provide an organised approach to freeing Tar-Baphon and recovering the *Key of Geb*. He established an iron-fisted, militaristic wing within the Seal-Breakers, to prevent it from degenerating into just another aimless apocalypse cult, and built its headquarters, the House of the Key, in a prehistoric [[Kellid]] catacomb located in the shadow of the [[Cenotaph]].
> Kothas' next goal, after having freed Tar-Baphon and recovered the *Key of Geb*, is to continue breaking the walls of reality that hold back its true, [[Chaos|chaotic]] nature. These include the resurgence of the [[Worldwound]] and the invocation of [[Great Old One|Great Old Ones]], before the seals of the [[Dead Vault]] could be broken, freeing [[Rovagug]], and leading to the destruction of the [[Material Plane]].
