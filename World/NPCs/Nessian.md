> **Nessian** was the leader of the [[Absalom]]-based gang the War Hounders. While the War Hounders were mainly an upstart band of thieves and thugs, Nessian was a formidable warrior who sacrificed some of the training other [[Fighter|fighters]] specialize in for a dirtier [[Fighting style|fighting style]]. In [[4708 AR]], he orchestrated a plan to initiate the centuries-old [[Silent Tide]], an attack by [[Undead|undead]] agents of [[Taldor|Taldors]] [[Black Echelon]] against the city, as a means to blackmail the citizenry and establish himself as a primary member of the Absalom underworld. However, his plans were foiled by the [[Pathfinder Society]].
> Nessian could most often be found at the War Hounders' base of operations, a mass of ruined siege towers known as the [[Pyramid of the Dog]].
