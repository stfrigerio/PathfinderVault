> **Panivar Lotheed** is the [[Immortality|immortal]] leader of the Immaculate Circle, a secret society that has been manipulating [[Taldor|Taldan]] politics for more than two centuries, and one of the most powerful individuals in Taldor.


## Relatives

> Panivar was born around three centuries ago as the eldest son and heir of his parents. He was married to [[Veleto Lotheed]], one of the few women Panivar considered his equal. After she died over a century ago, Panivar was unwilling to accept his loss, but as resurrection usually does not work on those who died of old age, he resorted to creating a [[Trompe l'oeil|trompe loeil]] duplicate to comfort and love himself.
> Panivar has kept his immortality a secret from his family by posing as a series of descendants and using forged birth certificates: when his great-nephew Mercater suspected that Panivar Lotheed VI was in fact the same person as Panivar Lotheed I, he had the [[Ichkoh|ichkoh]] Ehlers murder Mercater. Mercater's son [[Bartelby Lotheed|Bartelby]] suspects the same thing, but keeps his thoughts to himself after his father's shady death.


## Background

> Panivar followed in his family's [[Arcane magic|arcane]] tradition, and bonded with a canary [[Familiar|familiar]] at a young age. The canary's death left Panivar with a trauma of life ending, leaving behind a cold void. He became obsessed with death, specifically the [[Soul|soul]] and its transit and purpose. His research led him to the [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]], and he became fascinated with them.
> When Panivar inherited his family's wealth, he carefully managed it to keep his holdings secure and fund his research. His previous disinterest in politics quickly gave away, as Panivar learnt the value of favours and their value.
> In old age, Panivar's research led him to the [[Sahkil|sahkils]]. He [[Summon|summoned]] and bargained with the [[Kimenhul|kimenhul]] [[Thassritoum]]: Panivar granted Thassritoum access to the sleeping minds of his rivals, and Thassritoum shielded Panivar from the sight of psychopomps, preventing him from dying.
> For the next three centuries, Panivar accumulated wealth and influence as leader of the Immaculate Circle. During the reign of Grand Prince [[Stavian III]], they learnt that he accidentally murdered his own son [[Carrius Stavian|Carrius]] and kept it as a secret to blackmail Stavian. In [[4717 AR]], Panivar had Carrius' corpse stolen from his crypt and forcibly dragged his soul from the afterlife back to the [[Material Plane]]. To repair the damage of Carrius' soul, Panivar dispatched [[Night hag|night hags]] to the [[Astral Plane]] to steal the astral imprints of six greatest Grand Princes, and used the *Soul Crucible* to stitch them into a soul that could function as the prince.
