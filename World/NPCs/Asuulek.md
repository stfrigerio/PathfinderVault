>  **Asuulek** is an ancient [[Red dragon]] who lives in the [[volcano]] [[Asuulek's Mouth]] in western [[Osirion]]. Asuulek is mostly dormant unlike the volcano in which he lairs, which constantly spews forth smoke and steam. Asuulek is so fearsome that all travellers know to avoid the volcano that bears his name. Asuulek, when not dormant, indulges in destructive rampages through the surrounding area. Asuulek has not been nearly so destructive during the reign of the [[Khemet III|Ruby Prince]]. Rumor has it he may have taken an interest in the ruins beneath the neighboring volcano [[Sokar's Boil]]. These rumors claim that during an illegal excavation on the slopes of Sokar's Boil, not only was an ancient temple found, but sealed doors leading into the very heart of the volcano itself.
