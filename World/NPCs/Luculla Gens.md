> **Luculla Gens** is the [[Changeling|changeling]] owner of [[Sweet Tooth]] in [[Old Kintargo]] and leads a double life as both the sweet-natured owner of her confectionery shop and as the leader of [[Kintargo|Kintargos]] cult of [[Mahathallah]].


## Appearance

> Luculla has dark hair, is young and rather frail looking. When posing as a good-natured shopkeeper, Luculla hides her changeling nature, pretending to be a regular [[Human|human]]. She covers one of her heterochromatic eyes with an eye patch, claiming she lost it after a beating from her wicked stepfather, and always wears leather gloves to cover her claw-like nails. As a shopkeeper, Luculla dresses humbly to avoid drawing attention but as a cult leader she wears a distinctive amber and jade facemask.


## Personality

> Luculla acts flirtatiously and is a regular at the [[Tooth and Nail|Tooth and Nail tavern]] but this is all a front to cover her nefarious activities as a cult leader. As a cult leader she is ruthless, employing foul creatures including a [[Faceless stalker|faceless stalker]] and a [[Summoned|summoned]] [[Barbazu|bearded devil]]. Luculla has a preference for kidnapping victims on the cusp of adulthood, sacrificing them on the birthday when they would have flourished into full adulthood.
