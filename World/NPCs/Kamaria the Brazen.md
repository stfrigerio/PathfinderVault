> **Kamaria the Brazen** was the only [[Osirion|Osirian]] [[Pharaoh|pharaoh]] to openly worship an aspect of [[Rovagug]]; she ascended to the throne in [[-21 AR]]. The [[Pyramid of Kamaria|pyramid]] housing her much-plundered tomb stands in the city of [[An]] and continues to attract cultists of the Rough Beast. It is said that her pyramid, set on the banks of the [[Asp River|River Asp]], contains an [[Entrances to the Darklands|entrance to Nar-Voth]] in the [[Darklands]]. 
> In the tenth year of her reign, Kamaria commanded the people of An to build the pyramid as a monument befitting her majesty.
> Kamaria reigned for more than three [[Human|human]] lifetimes. Her era was notorious for its oppression and suffering. Her great unholy plan, known only to Kamaria's cult and her closest allies, was to unleash the dread god Rovagug on [[Golarion]] and beyond. The pharaoh was using the vast chambers and caves within and beneath the Pyramid of Kamaria as a lab and foundry for developing the means to realize her plan. To the relief of the world, some of Kamaria's horrified children engaged in a great conspiracy to assassinate their evil mother. She was succeeded by her son [[Gebessek IX]], who buried her in her Pyramid.
