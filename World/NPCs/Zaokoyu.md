> **Zaokoyu** was a [[Samurai|samurai]] of the [[Teikoku|Teikoku Shogunate]]. Zaokoyu is most well known for his death in [[290 AR]], after he had led an army to the northern reaches of Teikoku where it met the [[Forest of Spirits]]. He ventured too far and he and his forces were slaughtered by irate [[Kami|kami]]. The place of their death came to mark the northernmost limits of the Teikoku Shogunate, and its modern successor [[Minkai]].
