> **General Chakradev** is the founder of the relatively young [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapada]] of [[Nayapul]] in [[Vudra|Vudras]] [[Open Bridge]] region. General Chakradev never intended to become a rajah. In [[4606 AR]], with the death of the [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]], the [[Obari Ocean]] receded exposing a new land bridge which connected the once-remote islands off Vudra's southern tip, this new region was dubbed "Open Bridge". When scouts began exploring the new land bridge they found it crawling with hordes of [[Sorted Traits/creature/aberration|aberrations]]. General Chakradev responded hastily creating defences against this newly emerged horde. General Chakradev also began building more permanent defensive structures, fortifying the suddenly landlocked former port of [[Dhalanagar]] and rapidly converting it into a fortress city. General Chakradev was thrust into leadership after being made rajah of Nayapul, the land he had fortified to protect the rest of Vudra from the ravaging, aberrant hordes.
