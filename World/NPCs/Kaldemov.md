> **King Kaldemov**, facing the threat of a civil war among [[Ustalav]]'s noble families, split his nation into sixteen separate counties in [[2862 AR]]. Each of the major noble families were given nearly complete autonomy within their territories, but each also owed allegiance to the crown. This system of government survived until the nation's conquest by the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] in [[3203 AR]].
