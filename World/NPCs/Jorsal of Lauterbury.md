## Background

> Jorsal is a deeply religious warrior who dedicated his life to discovering the source of the [[Worldwound]]. He chronicled more than 50 missions into the [[Demon|demon]]-haunted land, created maps of its terrible geography, and recovered hundreds of strange and terrible [[Magical items|magical items]] for the [[Decemvirate]]. He has continued that work since the Worldwound's closing into the [[Sarkoris Scar]], though the Society's occupation of the Spire is in doubt, and its resources are running low.
