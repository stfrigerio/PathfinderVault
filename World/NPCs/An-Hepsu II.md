> **Pharaoh An-Hepsu II** of [[Osirion]] was known as the **Conquering Pharaoh**. He established the port of [[Totra]] in [[-2587 AR]]. The An Dynasty sent fleets from there to conquer what is now [[Thuvia]] and [[Rahadoum]]. An enormous, recently-built statue of An-Hepsu II now stands in Totra's harbor, its base constructed from pieces of destroyed [[Qadira|Qadiran]] monuments.
