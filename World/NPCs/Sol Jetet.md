> **Sol Jetet**, the trade-oriented Speaker of the Council in [[Ipeq]], has been involved in converting farmland to cotton and building outposts to defend a caravan route from [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]] attacks—hopefully turning the route into a profitable alternative to the sea route that traverses the [[Burning Cape]].
