> **Vashian Hearthmount** is one of the four members of the [[Ravengro Council]], the ruling body of the town of [[Ravengro]] in the [[Canterwall]] county of the nation of [[Ustalav]], where his family has now settled in a large house just west of the river. Vashian is a retired military commander and has kept his leadership skills in good use as the most experienced of the council members; the other three members often seek his guidance and he is a lifelong friend of Councilman [[Gharen Muricar]]. Vashian tends to deal with all legal issues in Ravengro as he is the closest to a solicitor that Ravengro possesses.
