> **Ilirjastehr** is a particular massive [[Fjord linnorm|fjord linnorm]] that dwells within the remarkably deep [[Lake Lost to the Sun]] within the [[Sarkoris Scar]]. Ilirjastehr serves not only as master of the lake's large population of [[Water orm|water orms]] but also as the envoy of the [[Eldest]] [[Fey|fey]] known as [[Ragadahn|Ragadahn the Serpent King]]. Despite being incredibly territorial, Ilirjastehr is much more likely than most fjord linnorms to take live prisoners, which he then escorts directly to Ragadahn via a [[Portal|planar tear]] in the depths of the lake that links with Ragadahn's realm of the [[Cerulean Sea]] in the [[First World]].
