> **Khurram abol Ghasem** is a noble [[Marid|marid]], [[Shahzada|shahzada]], and patriarch of a marid clan that migrated to the ruins of [[Kho]] after the city's fall. The clan moved through the damaged seals of the [[Portal|planar portals]] that had been used to endlessly supply Kho's Cistern Major with fresh water. The vast cistern is still almost intact in the ruins of the city, and its waters empty through countless cracked reservoirs and fractured aqueducts, forming the headwaters of the Uomoto River. 
> Khurram is the self-proclaimed ruler of [[Kho]], and the arrogant marids claim the cistern and the river that flows through and out of the valley as their own and tend it as a great palace and garden, shaped by their power of [[Illusion|illusion]]. The shahzada and his court—his wife [[Zahra]], daughter [[Shireesha]], and his son-in-law [[Juqua]], as well as his personal priest [[Kaila]] and more than a dozen of their cousins who come and go to the [[Plane of Water]]—claim all of Kho, but in reality their rule stretches only as far as Iouri's Cascade, where the waters of the Cistern Major pour into the Lower City.
