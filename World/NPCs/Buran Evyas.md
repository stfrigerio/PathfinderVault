> **Buran Evyas** is the fourth Evyas to rule the city of [[Kridorn]]. A greedy and power-hungry man, Buran Evyas sees himself as [[Iobaria|Iobarias]] future overlord. Focused on his city's reputation, he is easily manipulated by his many advisers, and leaves most municipal decisions in the hands of others.
> Evyas regularly orders marauders to enter into [[Norinor]] to press gang the forest's inhabitants into the ranks of his growing forces.
