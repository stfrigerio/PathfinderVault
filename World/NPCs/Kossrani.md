> **Kossrani** is an embittered [[Dwarf|dwarven]] mercenary who serves the Church of [[Asmodeus]] and helped assist [[Barzillai Thrune|Lord-Mayor Barzillai Thrune]] in his rise to power in [[Kintargo]]. Kossrani originally wanted to become a priest of Asmodeus but, early on in his training, it became clear he lacked the mental aptitude to become a [[Cleric|cleric]]; he, instead, settled on becoming a church-affiliated thug-for-hire. Kossrani was quick to volunteer to assist with Barzillai Thrune's takeover of Kintargo, finding a place running an impromptu prison in the [[Sallix Salt Works]].
