> The powerful [[Marilith|marilith]] [[Demon|demon]] **Zuhra Aponavicius** rules the city of [[Drezen]] in the [[Worldwound]]. She is one of the two most powerful of the Worldwound's many warlords—the other is the [[Balor|balor]] [[Khorramzadeh]], known as the Storm King.
> She is considered to be a bloodthirsty general even by demonic standards, appearing to be indifferent to the casualty level among her own forces provided enemies are also dying.
> Historically, the demonic forces of the Worldwound were driven back by what came to be known as the [[Mendevian CrusadesFirst Mendevian Crusade|First Mendevian Crusade]]. When the crusaders grew complacent, the demons counter-attacked, regaining lost territory and then expanding beyond their previous borders. Zuhra commanded the forces which captured the crusader citadel of Drezen; it has been her stronghold ever since.
