> **Governor Bozbeyli**, a veteran of [[Taldor|Taldors]] cavalry, rules [[Cassomir|Cassomir Prefecture]] from [[Grayguard Castle]].



## History

> Bozbeyli was once a poor peasant in Cassomir who served in a militia under the command of the city's then-governor. He became a hero as an officer in the [[Taldan Horse]] while fighting in several border disputes with [[Qadira]] in [[Zimar|Zimar Prefecture]]. As a result, he was promoted to the senatorial class by [[Stavian III]] and given the responsibility to run Cassomir as efficiently as he led his troops in the cavalry.


## Rule

> One of Governor Bozbeyli's current objectives is to clear the [[Dog's Teeth|Dogs Teeth]] district, which is immediately west of his residence of Grayguard Castle.
> In an effort to improve relations with [[Andoran]], Cassomir's neighbor to the west across the [[Sellen River]], Governor Bozbeyli has ordered the hanging of several notorious [[Taldan]] bandits on [[Pharasma's Pulpit|Pharasmas Pulpit]]. Whether this has had the desired effect with the Andoren country folk is debatable.
> Rumours, perhaps in response to his actions to clear the [[Dog's Teeth|Dogs Teeth]] district, have created the incorrect perception among Cassomir's residents that Bozbeyli is a corrupt blowhard. The ruthless nature of his entourage—a full company of the city's guards—causes his every movement through Cassomir to potentially result in trampled citizens and smashed street vendors' stalls.


## Appearance

> Bozbeyli is a stout, strong man in middle age with graying black hair and a well-groomed gray beard. He always carries his [[Qadira|Qadiran]] [[Scimitar|scimitar]] in his belt, a weapon he got from a Qadiran bandit-king in the [[World's Edge Mountains|Southern Range]].


## Family

> The governor has a cousin named Julien Marley, and an arrogant nephew named Orfeo Bozbeyli. Despite his humble start, Governor Bozbeyli is a distant cousin of Stavian III (and implicitly Stavian's daughter [[Eutropia Stavian]] as well).
