> **Ervin Roslar** was a member of the [[Knights of Ozem]], one of the greatest heroes of the [[Shining Crusade]], and the namesake of the town of [[Roslar's Coffer|Roslars Coffer]] in [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]].


## Background

> Ervin Roslar was a [[Paladin|paladin]] dedicated to the [[Demigod|demigoddess]] [[Arazni]], [[Herald|herald]] of [[Aroden]]. He adored Arazni to the point of wanting her love, which would prove to be his downfall. Disguised agents of the [[Whispering Way]] promised to help Roslar gain Arazni's love; he listened and let loose important information about the Knights of Ozem in the process. Later, Roslar was horrified to learn of the true identity of his benefactors and the vital role of the information he divulged in Arazni's death. He threw himself with abandon into battle and died a hero.
> Before Roslar was interred in his tomb, rumours surfaced about his involvement in Arazni's death. The Knights of Ozem, unwilling to call shame upon a member, conducted an inconclusive investigation. Roslar was buried elsewhere, and his legacy became shrouded in scandal.


## Associates

> Roslar was the commander of the Red Shrikes, an elite team of troubleshooters. Like Roslar, they were not buried in the tomb dedicated to honour them, as most of them died long after the end of the Shining Crusade. Roslar's favourite [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]] was the stallion **Abdell**; after Abdell's death, Roslar insisted that the horse's remains would be kept near his own.
