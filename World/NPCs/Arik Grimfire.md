> **Arik Grimfire** is the ruler of the small town of [[Skjoldmur]] located in the south of the island of [[Aegos]], the larger island comprising [[Broken Bay]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]].
> Grimfire's ancestors had ruled Skjoldmur for centuries. He is a [[Cleric|priest]] of [[Gorum]] and he and his acolytes are renowned across [[Ulfen]] lands for their skill in fighting and warding off the [[Undead|undead]]. Some of the [[Fighter|fighters]] he has trained often find their way south and east, aiding the living throughout [[Avistan]]. Grimfire secretly disapproves of [[Ingimundr the Unruly|his lieges]] lust of war because he believes that the result will be the destruction of their kingdom.
