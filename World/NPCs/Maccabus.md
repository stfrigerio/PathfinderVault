> **Maccabus** is one of the senior enforcers of [[Zandros]]' [[Goatherds]], a criminal gang in the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] capital of [[Egorian]].  Unlike Zandros' other henchmen, Maccabus, or Mac as he is known to those close to him, prefers to go about his business quietly and without bravado.  He is an older man, with white hair and a perpetual squint as he takes in his surroundings.
