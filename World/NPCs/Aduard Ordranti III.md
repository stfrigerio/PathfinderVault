> Despite having been the ruler of [[Ustalav]] for more than three decades, **Prince Aduard Ordranti III** is almost completely indifferent to his role as leader of a nation.  Born as the younger brother of [[Valislav Ordranti]] (who eventually became known as the 'Eunuch Prince'), most believed he was destined never to rule.  When his brother died without a legitimate heir in [[4674 AR]], Aduard was thrust upon the throne. Aduard has never adjusted to the subtle politicking of [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]] court life, and approaches most situations with the tactless, blunt approach of a soldier (he held an honorary position as a general in the Ustalavic army). When discretion is necessary, Aduard relies on his brother's aged advisor, [[Diauden]], and it is on his advice that he seeks a wife to give him an heir.
