> One of the eight crimelords of [[Riddleport]], the [[Half-orc|half-orc]] named **Boss Croat** runs several street gangs and controls much of the trade of illicit or illegal substances on the street. He is well known to hire only half-orcs as his enforcers, and as the main person to write contracts for professional assassinations. He has a group called hushmen who do this dirty work for him.
> The compound of this very rotund leader is at the end of Silk Street in Northern Riddleport.
