> **Yargos Gill** was a military historian in the [[Puddles]] district of [[Absalom]]. In [[4708 AR]], he came into possession of a centuries-old codebook used by the [[Black Echelon]] to infiltrate and weaken the city's defenses in preparation for the [[Silent Tide]]. Gill unwittingly set into motion the operatives' plan, and the book was taken from him by [[Nessian]], leader of the War Hounders gang. He enlisted the help of the [[Pathfinder Society]] to recover it and end the threat against the city.
