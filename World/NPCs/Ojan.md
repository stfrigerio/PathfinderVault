> **Ojan** and his twin sister [[Jasilia]] are the younger siblings of [[Khemet III]], ruler of [[Osirion]]. They are currently the heirs to the throne.
> They are known as the **Dune Runners** because of their habit of disappearing to explore the desert – much to the exasperation of the [[Risen Guard]], who are usually given the task of finding them and returning them to the palace.
