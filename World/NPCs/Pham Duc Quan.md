> **Dragon King Pham Duc Quan** is the mighty ruler of the empire of [[Xa Hoi]]. An [[Imperial dragon|imperial dragon]] in [[Human|human]] guise, Quan is the thirteenth [[Dragon King]] to rule in direct succession from his ancestor, [[Pham Toan Rong]]. Quan and his twelve predecessors are revered in an almost religious fashion by some of his subjects (though they are not worshiped as [[Deity|gods]], merely adored like saints).
> Quan took the throne in [[4510 AR]], decades prior to neighboring [[Lung Wa|Lung Was]] collapse, and helped guide Xa Hoi through the chaos that engulfed [[Tian Xia]] in the following decades and made it one of the continent's greatest powers. His [[Dragon|draconic]] siblings are the generals of his human legions. Quan pursues friendly relations with most neighboring countries, though he has recently stepped up naval activity in response to [[Pirate|pirates]] from [[Minata]].
