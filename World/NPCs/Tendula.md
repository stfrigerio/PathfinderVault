> **Tendula** is the rajah of the [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapada]] of [[Janvari]]. Sitting in the south-east of the [[Vudra|Vudran]] region of [[Crying Jungle]], Tendula's kingdom lies just east of the sacred [[Jansagar Lake]], home of the [[Deity|goddess]] [[Janpati]]. Jansagar Lake possesses a unique property: many [[Animal|animals]] that drink from it are immediately granted full sapience. Tendula's mahajanapada consists almost entirely of these awakened animals and Tendula is no exception being an awakened [[Panther|panther]].
