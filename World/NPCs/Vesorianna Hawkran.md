> **Vesorianna Hawkran** was the wife of [[Lyvar Hawkran]]; her husband was the head warden of [[Harrowstone]] prison near [[Ravengro]], in [[Canterwall]] county, [[Ustalav]]. They both lived together in a house within the prison grounds. 
> On the day when her husband bravely died in a great fire in [[4661 AR]], after preventing a mass prisoner escape, Vesorianna came to the prison to look for her husband. Discovering the chaos at the prison, in her fear, she exacerbated the problem and was restrained. Tragically, she then lost her own life in the smoke caused by the fire, as she was held by her restraints. Her death is commemorated on the [[Harrowstone Memorial]] in Ravengro.
