> **Garbold Talhrik** was son of [[Talhrik|King Talhrik the Industrious]]. Upon his father's death Garbold was crowned but only after much infighting and passionate negotiation. Unfortunately became a victim of treachry. [[Ordrik Talhrik]] was King Garbold Talhrik's cousin and closest advisor but also a cleric of [[Droskar]]. He was controlling his cousin with addictive substances and making him to cede more and more power to the priests of Droskar. Ordrik murdered his cousin and seized the throne of the [[Five Kings Mountains]] kingdom in [[4369 AR]] and attempted to create a theocracy. The resulting [[Forge War]] raged for 13 years. Generals loyal to the true crown fought to keep their kingdom but they failed and in [[4382 AR]], Ordrik declared himself theocrat and all dwarves had to work in Droskar's name.
