> **Sarnok** was an [[Adlet|adlet]] warrior-shaman who led the adlet tribes living near the Vahara Glacier, within the [[Drakelands]] of [[Triaxus]]. He owned a [[Magic|magical]] [[Spear|spear]], which he used to slay multiple [[Dragon|dragons]]. He was a skilled diplomat in addition to a warrior, and was able to establish peace treaties between the adlet tribes and a number of Drakelands realms. According to adlet tribal legend, he vanished while exploring the Rimekeening Crevasse, a ravine within the Vahara Glacier, but promised to return one day to guide his people to glory once again. His grave is believed to be located somewhere within the Crevasse.
