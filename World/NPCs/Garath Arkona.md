> **Lord Garath Arkona** led [[House Arkona]] from destitution to tremendous wealth in the mid- and late-45th centuries [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]].


## Background

> Facing poverty, Arkona borrowed money from [[House Jeggare]] to fund a last-ditch expedition to [[Vudra]]. He and his brother Jenkson purchased the [[Caravel|caravel]] *[[Reprieve]]*, outfitted it with a skeleton crew, and in a troubled voyage arrived to [[Sihadrimon]] in the summer of [[4460 AR]] to trade in Vudran luxuries.
> Their journey back to Korvosa, while relatively swift and financially successful, left them changed; unbeknownst to those around them, Garath and Jenkson had been replaced by the [[Rakshasa|rakshasas]] [[Mapras]] and Dandra, who killed the Arkonas in Sihadriman and took on their likenesses as a disguise.
