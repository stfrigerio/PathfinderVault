> **Casp Avertin** was the sheriff of [[Sandpoint]] up until [[4702 AR]]. It was during the [[Late Unpleasantness]] in Sandpoint that Sheriff Avertin became the final murder victim of the notorious serial killer known as [[Chopper]]. Avertin's body was found, mutilated, in a dark alley in Sandpoint. [[Belor Hemlock]], a deputy at the time and largely considered to be the man that brought Chopper to justice, succeeded Casp Avertin as Sandpoint's sheriff and continues to hold that position.


## Relatives

> Casp is the son of [[Alma Avertin]], who has been the owner of [[Sandpoint Savories]] for around 20 years. Alma has never recovered from Casp's death, and currently most business is conducted by his sisters, twins [[Arika Avertin|Arika]] and [[Aneka Avertin|Aneka]].


## Associates

> After the death of Mayor Fenchus Deverin, Casp was responsible for nominating Fenchus' sister, [[Kendra Deverin|Kendra]], who ended up winning the mayoral election by a landslide. By the time of Casp's death, he and Kendra were in a relationship and preparing for marriage. After Casp died, Kendra gave up on romance to focus on politics.
