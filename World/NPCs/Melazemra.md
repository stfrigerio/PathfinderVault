> The [[Umbral dragon|umbral dragon]] **Melazemra** was transformed centuries in the past by exposure to energies that caused her to become a creature of entropy. She came to the [[Midnight Isles]] some time after this, making a lair in the mountains of the island of [[Colyphyr island|Colyphyr]]. Most recently, she has formed a truce with a group of cultists of [[Baphomet]] led by the [[Nephilim|nephilim]] Hepzamirah, allowing them passage through her lair to mine the [[Nahyndrian crystal|Nahyndrian crystals]] found below the island in exchange for an offering of a [[Gold|golden]] scepter and a *lyre of storms* for her hoard.
