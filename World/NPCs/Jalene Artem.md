> **Jalene Artem** is the lovely barmaid of the [[Sitting Duck]] tavern in [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]]. Jalene is actually one of [[Thuldrin Kreed|Thuldrin Kreeds]] most trusted agents. She is as skilled in slitting throats as she is at prying secrets from the customers. The owner of the Duck, [[Ergin Tock]], and Jalene report to Kreed every morning on everything important that they saw or heard at the Duck.
