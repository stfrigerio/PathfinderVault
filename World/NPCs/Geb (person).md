> **Geb**, founder and overlord of his [[Geb|namesake nation]], is a powerful [[Necromancer|necromancer]] whose [[Magic|magic]] is in the tradition of ancient [[Osirion]]. His life is marked by his overriding passion, a rivalry with the [[Archmage]] [[Nex person|Nex]].



## Relatives

> Geb was born in [[Sothis]], the younger son of a powerful noble family with ambitions for the Osirian throne. During his family's rebellion against [[Pharaoh]] [[Kenaton]], Geb served as a [[Wizard|wizard]] and mortuary priest. In -1119 AR, when Kenaton defeated his family, burying its leaders and sentencing the rest to exile, Geb fled Sothis for [[Mechitar]], in Osirion's southern frontier.


## Background

> In -1108 AR, Geb politely asked the governor of Mechitar to make him king. When he was laughed at, Geb tore the governor's [[Soul|soul]] from his body and became the ruler of a new country that now bears his name.
> Initially, Geb's relationship with his neighbour Nex, the only other wizard of their age who could be his peer, was mostly cordial. The two visited each other, and their nations engaged in peaceful diplomatic relations. As each showed off their powers to the only other person who could understand, their professional competition grew more and more vicious, since neither could accept to be second-best.
> Geb and Nex first went to war in [[-892 AR]]. Both used powerful magic to extend their lives, so the conflict lasted for centuries. It was responsible for the creation of the [[Mana Wastes]].
> In [[576 AR]], Geb launched a gas attack on Nex's capital of [[Quantium]], killing thousands, and supposedly won the contest when his rival disappeared and has not been seen since. Uncertainty as to Nex's exact fate ate away at Geb, who believed that his rival was merely waiting until he could have the chance to retaliate. His search for a way to determine Nex's true fate ended when Geb committed suicide in [[632 AR]].
> However, his obsession with Nex could not be ended so easily: Geb rose as a [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]], unable to find rest until he can convince himself that Nex was truly defeated. Nex has not been seen for four millennia, but Geb still worries that his rival has somehow managed to survive.
> For many years, Geb found himself directionless, only finding relief by taking a personal interest in anything that might challenge him. In [[3890 AR]], in retaliation to an invasion by the [[Knights of Ozem]], Geb stole the corpse of [[Arazni]] and reanimated her as a [[Lich|lich]]. In [[4329 AR]], when the warrior women of [[Holomog]] invaded Geb, he turned all of them into stone, creating the [[Field of Maidens]], and rained down a cataclysm on their capital city. However, each defeated foe only sank Geb further into despair, since none of them could hope to match his old rival.
> After turning Arazni into his queen, Geb left her to rule in his stead and became more and more secluded, rarely appearing before his people.
> When Nex's [[Fleshforge|fleshforges]] began to activate and powerful monsters marched into the Mana Wastes, Geb felt excitement for the first time in millennia. Around the same time, in [[4719 AR]], after Arazni's disappearance, Geb returned to active rulership and began preparing his nation for a grand destiny, as he was certain that his old rival Nex was returning soon. However, Geb continues to be bound to [[Mechitar]]; he fails to remember his suicide and revival, and is unaware that his imprisonment is due to his own nature as a ghost.


## Recent associates

> After recently returning to active rulership, Geb noticed that at least three cities, including the greatest [[Necromancy|necromancy]] school in Geb, had vanished. Some of his subjects deduce that they were taken into the *[[Hao Jin Tapestry]]*. Geb has sent ambassadors to [[Goka]] to demand their return or the aid of [[Hao Jin]] herself as compensation.
> [[Camilia Drannoch]] has been secretly negotiating with Geb to rid [[Galt]] of the *[[Final blade|final blades]]*. Geb is interested in reforging the *final blades* into [[Weapon|weapons]] for his [[Graveknight|graveknight]] generals, and is in an excellent position to negotiate since his country produces plenty of food for the starving Galtan rebels.
> Having noticed the [[Firearm|firearms]] of [[Alkenstar]] and the [[Technology|technological]] secrets of [[Dongun Hold]], Geb seeks an alliance with Anong Arunak, if only to deprive Nex of a potential ally.
