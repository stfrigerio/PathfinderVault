> **Borshaggat** is an [[Umbral dragon|umbral dragon]] who dwells in the caverns below the island of [[Dahak's Fang|Dahaks Fang]] in the [[Shackles]]. He is a [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Dahak]] who spends most of his time away from his trove, which is probably safe since it exists in the same cavern complex as that of [[Aashaq|Aashaq the Annihilator]].
