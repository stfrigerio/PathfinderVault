> **Errindayn the Seer** united the [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaur]] of [[The Caemorin]] under his flag in [[1900 AR]]. His followers destroyed numerous [[Humanoid|humanoid]] settlements in southeastern [[Iobaria]], including the port city of [[Mirnbay]]. After an unusually long life for a centaur, Errindayn passed away of mysterious causes in [[1986 AR]], and his followers abandoned their warlike ways. However, tensions between the centaurs and humanoids of the region would last for another 500 years.
