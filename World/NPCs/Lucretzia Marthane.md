> **Lady Lucretzia Marthane** is a [[Taldor|Taldan]] terrorist operating under the [[Vigilante|vigilante]] secret identity of **Night Swan**. She believes that everyone should steal to get what they want, and any and all laws or rules must be abolished. Influenced by [[Galt|Galtan]] ideals, she hopes to bring down the entire Taldan establishment and initiate total self rule.


## Appearance

> Lucretzia, in her public identity, is thin and pale, and walks with a bit of a stagger. As the Night Swan, she is lithe, agile, and graceful. Her hair is long, platinum, and tightly bound, either in a bun (as Lucretzia) or a whipping braid (as the Night Swan).


## Background

> Lucretzia Marthane was born into a noble family and received a proper lady's education during her early years, until a political rival bankrupted her family. Destitute and landless, Lucretzia's parents sold her belongings, and she held onto the most salacious books: stories of heroic outlaws fighting injustice, and banned treatises on Galtan [[Philosophy|philosophy]]. These books were a major influence on young Lucretzia's world view.
> Lucretzia began stealing from only those that wronged her parents, but later expanded her efforts to anyone who possessed more wealth than the Marthane family, believing those riches should rightfully belong to her. After many run-ins with the law, she started to believe that authority was inherently corrupt for everyone subservient to another; and that ownership was theft, and that the worst thieves in Taldor were the nobles.
> Lucretzia adapted the Night Swan persona to hide her true identity and provide a symbol for others to rally around. She focuses on theft and destruction, ironically investing her ill-gotten gains to improve her own living standards to the comfortable levels she enjoyed in her youth. Her anarchist tendencies have turned her into a folk hero and a dashing bandit among the public, and, as the Night Swan, her completely fictitious adventures have become the subject of cheap but sensational novels published by a small house in [[Cassomir]].
