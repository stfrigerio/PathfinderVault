> **White Estrid** is the current king (the term is used for both genders in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]) of the city of [[Halgrim]].  An albino with white hair and pale blue eyes, she is a fierce warrior known for conducting daring raids.  She gained much notoriety and renown in [[4704 AR]] when she led a daring raid of 15 [[Longship|longships]] on the [[Nidal|Nidalese]] port of [[Nisroch]], then broke a [[Cheliax|Chelaxian]] blockade at the [[Arch of Aroden]] and triumphantly pulled into port at [[Absalom]] to sell her treasure.
> She became a [[Linnorm King]] in 4704 AR when she defeated the [[Linnorm|linnorm]] known as [[Boiltongue]] with the help of a mighty weapon she claims she received from "earth spirits", a statement which angered the other rulers of her land.  Unlike them, she refused to mount the stuffed linnorm in her throne room, but instead keep him as her thrall, a decision that caused the other Linnorm Kings to scoff. Boiltongue refuses to say much, other than that he was defeated in combat by Estrid and bargained his life for servitude. He is somewhat of a sore subject and largely avoided in conversation, being simply referred to as Estrid's Pet when it is necessary to discuss him, but his presence greatly increased Halgrim's defenses.
