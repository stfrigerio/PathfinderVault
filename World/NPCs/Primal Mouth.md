> The **Primal Mouth** is a particularly powerful spawn of [[Abhoth]] who has taken residence in a cavern in the [[Midnight Mountains]] connected to its progenitor's lair, where it has gathered a monstrous cult of [[Gug|gugs]]. It is curious about the lands above and seeks to open a [[Portal|portal]] between its lair and a large city in the surface.
