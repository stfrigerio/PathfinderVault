> **Angothane** was the second [[Runelords|runelord of wrath]] and ruler of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] realm of [[Bakrakhan]], reigning from [[-6266 AR]] to [[-6150 AR]].


## Appearance

> Angothane was a blond, handsome man with waist-length hair and heterochromia.


## Background

> After the first runelord of wrath, Alderpash, was imprisoned in the [[Ivory Labyrinth]], following the failure of his plan to betray and sacrifice [[Sorshen]] to [[Baphomet]], Angothane struck a bargain with the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Nocticula]] and seized power, becoming Alderpash's successor, with her help. At the same time, Nocticula also secretly used a *[[Mindbind figurine|mindbind figurine]]* to turn Angothane into her sleeper agent.
> In [[-6150 AR]], Nocticula activated the *mindbind figurine* and compelled Angothane to assassinate his rival, the runelord of sloth [[Xirie]], during a meeting beneath [[Kaer Maga]]. This was the start of a schism that nearly led to civil war if it were not for [[Xanderghul|Xanderghuls]] murder of Angothane and two other runelords, [[Atharend]] and [[Jurah]]. Angothane was succeeded by [[Xiren]]. Regardless, Angothane's actions forever set the runelords at odds against each other, and conflicts between Thassilonian domains became common from that point onward.
> Angothane's [[Soul|soul]] was sent to the [[Midnight Isles]], Nocticula's [[Abyssal realm]], after his death. Due to his role in aiding Nocticula's assassination of [[Colyphyr]], Xirie's patron, he was allowed to become a [[Balor|balor]] in the isle of [[Tharvool]] over millennia.
