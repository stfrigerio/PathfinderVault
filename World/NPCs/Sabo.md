> **Sabo the Spider** is an intense and dedicated [[Inquisitor|inquisitor]] of [[Asmodeus]] who serves the church in [[Kintargo]]. Since the rise of [[Barzillai Thrune]] as Lord-Mayor, she has served as the warden of the [[Holding House]] prison. Sabo is a soft-spoken but very intense woman who tends to use sporadic flirtations and innuendo to keep those around her uncomfortable. She runs the Holding House through a combination of intimidation and threats of a visit to the resident [[Apocrisiarius|apocrisiarius]] [[Velstrac|velstrac]]. Sabo is diligent in her work, possessing a fierce loyalty to the [[Temple of Asmodeus Kintargo|Church of Asmodeus]] who have temporarily loaned her to [[House Thrune]] to assist in solidifying their control of Kintargo.
