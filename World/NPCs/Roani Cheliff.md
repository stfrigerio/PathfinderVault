> **Roani Cheliff** is the Chief Constable of [[Cassomir's Constabulary|Cassomirs Constabulary]]. She is a polite woman who understands the city's politics. She shows obvious favoritism toward the rich and high-born. Lowborn criminals are quickly and severely punished for their crimes while the wealthy and influential criminals are merely placed under house arrest.
