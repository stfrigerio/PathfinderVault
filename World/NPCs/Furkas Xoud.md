> The [[Technomancer|technomancer]] **Furkas Xoud** was once an adept in [[Numeria|Numerias]] [[Technic League]], a collection of powerful arcanists interested in exploring and exploiting the incredible [[Technology|technology]] found in the [[Silver Mount]].


## History

> Xoud was the born to aristocrats in [[Caliphas]] and left them soon after maturing into a prodigy of both [[Magic|magic]] and [[Science|science]] to join the [[Technic League]]. While he excelled as a [[Technomancer|technomancer]], he soon grew frustrated by bureaucratic obstacles within the League that prevented his mastery of [[Nanite|nanites]].
> After faking his death and fleeing the League in [[4703 AR]]—just before he was formally exiled for worshiping [[Zyphus]]—he traveled south and used his talents to construct the smoke-spewing [[Choking Tower]] in the woods near Numeria's border with the [[River Kingdoms]]. A specialist in the creation of [[Golem|golems]], Furkas is believed to have created a powerful [[Noqual golem|noqual golem]] during this time, and locals began spreading rumors of a "smoke wizard" living in the tower.


## Current events

> Even though the Choking Tower still stands, none has heard news of Xoud for years, and most presume him to be deceased.
