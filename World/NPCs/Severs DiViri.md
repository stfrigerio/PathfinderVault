> **Lictor Severs "Boneclaw" DiViri** (sometimes spelt DiVri) is the leader of the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Nail]] in [[Korvosa]].  He resides in [[Bastion Dominus|Lictors Keep]] (also called the Keep of Tyranny) in [[Citadel Vraid]] to the south of the city, and only rarely leaves his post there to travel into Korvosa and work directly with the field marshal of the [[Korvosan Guard]].
> The Lictor received his nickname from his magically withered right hand that he keeps concealed in a prominent, black gauntlet. His face is terribly scarred from numerous conflicts.
> As Lictor he has demonstrated a deft ability to to acquire favors and funds from the members of Korvosan society, and is quite open to requests for aid. Only after reaching agreement on price, does he send the required number of Hellknights out on the requested mission. The leader of this dedicated group then serves as the contact and works with officers and liaisons of the Korvosan Guards to complete the mission.
> Signifer Chaid DiViri, one the lictor's three granddaughters, was sent to [[Fort Inevitable]] to organize an expedition into the [[Emerald Spire]].
