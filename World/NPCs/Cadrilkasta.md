> **Cadrilkasta ** is a wyrm [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] currently excavating a [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] ruin at [[Guiltspur]] in northern [[Varisia]] using enslaved [[Ogre|ogres]] and [[Giant|giants]].


## History

> Cadrilkasta (the blue wyrm) was orphaned before she was even born: a party of adventurers killed her mother, but never found the lair. As she aged and became desirous of an education, she moved her lair to the [[Hungry Mountains]] and abducted scholars who taught her about Thassilon. She has returned to the [[Hold of Belkzen]] to explore Thassilonian ruins.


## Lair

> She maintains a hoard in the sea cliffs of [[Razmiran]]. One of the treasures therein is the [[Howling Horn]], which was made from the horns of the legendary dragon [[Kazavon]].
