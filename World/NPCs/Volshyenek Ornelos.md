> **Lord Volshyenek Ornelos** was an important figure in the early history of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]].  Born into [[House Ornelos]], an ancient and wealthy [[Cheliax|Chelaxian]] noble family, Volshyenek relocated his estate and family to Korvosa upon losing the favor of the imperial court in [[Westcrown]].  Fearing old age, the [[Wizard|wizard]] made an infernal pact with the [[Devil|devil]] [[Lorthact]] to stop his aging.  Volshyenek was tricked, however, and realized too late that, although he no longer aged, he was not [[Immortal|immortal]].  He died of old age in [[4493 AR]], whereupon his identity was taken over by Lorthact.  The devil continued living under this assumed identity until [[4607 AR]], when he was forced to abandon it.
