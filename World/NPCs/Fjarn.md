> **Fjarn** is a burly, corpse-grey [[Undead|undead]] creature in the service of the Pallid Princess, [[Urgathoa]]. Once an [[Ulfen]] [[Linnorm King]], Fjarn was forced to slaughter and consume his entire honor guard. After killing himself in shame he rose as a [[Ghast|ghast]], but still maintains all of his [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarian]] powers. Fjarn prefers to eat his defeated foes.
