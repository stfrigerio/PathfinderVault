> **Brivit Nae** is guildmaster of the [[Scrivener's Guild|Scriveners Guild]], a position that by tradition also makes her head librarian and conservator of the [[Forae Logos]] in [[Absalom]]. She also serves as a member of the city's [[Grand Council]], representing the [[Wise Quarter]]. She originally hails from [[Irrisen]].
> As head librarian, she's known for being stern and meticulous about following the Forae Logos's strict policies, but also for her generous efforts to copy the library's holdings at reasonable rates and expand its collection. Brivit restores many of the library's fragile tomes herself.
