> Guaril Karela is the mastermind behind most of the [[Sczarni]] activity in and around [[Absalom]] and [[Varisia]], a criminal empire he grew from a small operation in Absalom in [[4709 AR]] to a dominant position among Sczarni families by [[4713 AR]]. He keeps a low profile, once working the counter of his curio shop in the [[Docks]], the Pickled Imp, and later going into hiding as his Varisian ambitions generated several powerful new enemies.
> [[Qadira|Qadiran]] Trade Prince [[Aaqir al'Hakam|Aaqir alHakam]] approached Guaril in [[4714 AR]] to join [[The Exchange faction|The Exchange]], a new trade syndicate formed from the assets of the former [[Qadira faction]] of the [[Pathfinder Society]].
