> War-Marshal **Brithuan** is the [[Duergar|duergar]] leader of the Nar-Voth community of [[Fellstrok]]. Having only recently retaken the formerly [[Dwarf|dwarven]] ruins, he works tirelessly to ward off the continuing attacks of local tribes of [[Grimlock|grimlocks]], [[Mongrelman|mongrelmen]], and other [[Darklands]] creatures whilst simultaneously trying to refortify Fellstrok in case of invasion by blood thirsty [[Orc|orcs]] or vengeful [[Dwarf|dwarves]] from the surface above. In [[4710 AR]], War-Marshal Brithuan reached an accord with the orc [[Tulluk Clovenface]], leader of the [[Haskodar tribe]], who had long considered the duergar of Fellstrok their main rivals. In exchange for a truce, Brithuan provided the Haskodar tribe with [[Slaves|slaves]] and [[Weapon|weapons]] on the condition that they invade and take over the city of [[Blisterwell]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. Brithuan's ultimate plan is to use the city as a resource-rich beachhead aiming to eventually destabilise [[Grask Uldeth|Grask Uldeths]] hold on the city of [[Urgir]].
