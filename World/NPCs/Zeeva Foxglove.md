> **Zeeva Foxglove** is the owner and operator of the [[Green Market]] in the [[South Shore]] district of [[Korvosa]]. Zeeva is a member of an [[House Foxglove|aristocratic family]] from [[Magnimar]], but has not lived in western [[Varisia]] since tragedy struck the Foxgloves in [[4693 AR]]. Her mother, [[Cyralie Foxglove|Cyralie]], went [[Madness|mad]] and burned down their manor's outbuilding and attempted to set the house itself on fire. Zeeva's father, [[Traver Foxglove|Traver]], threw his wife from the building's second story to her death on the jagged rocks below and then took his own life. After a short stint in a Magnimarian orphanage, Zeeva, her sister [[Sendeli Foxglove|Sendeli]], and brother [[Aldern Foxglove|Aldern]] were taken in by their father's second cousin and raised in Korvosa.
> In [[4704 AR]], Zeeva purchased the Green Market, which had lain abandoned for several years after the untimely death of its previous owner. After a year of remodeling, she reopened the market and has seen its popularity and profitability grow beyond her wildest dreams. She allows merchants in the market to sell any common goods from food and clothing to jewelry and [[Art|art]] but forbids the sale of [[Weapon|weapons]], [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]], or [[Magic|magic]].
