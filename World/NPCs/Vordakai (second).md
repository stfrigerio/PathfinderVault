>  The second **Vordakai** is an ancient [[Cyclops]] [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich]] and the legendary enemy of the [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur]] tribes living in western [[Iobaria]].



## Appearance

>  Vordakai's only eye was plucked out and replaced with an *oculus of Abaddon*.


## Associates

>  The second Vordakai was the least of the apprentices of the first Vordakai, a notorious tyrant and [[necromancer]] who lived in [[Koloran]] in the late [[Age of Legend]]. After the first Vordakai's death in the upheaval that followed [[Earthfall]], his apprentice adopted his name in the hope of using its power to rebuild the empire.
>  Vordakai's [[Familiar]] is a [[Raven]] called **Horagnamon**.


## Background

>  Vordakai was betrayed by his would-be minions, who imprisoned him within a tomb of his own design, hidden in a forbidding mountain range between the [[Stolen Lands]] and Iobaria. However, his [[soul]] did not rest in his crypt; knowing that he might one day rise to plague the lands again, the local centaur [[shamans]] started to bring their tribes to the [[Dunsward]] near Vordakai's tomb and give them the sacred task of watching over the Valley of the Dead. This tradition was eventually broken when [[Taldor]] expanded into the Stolen Lands and came into conflict with the centaurs. After a few generations, guardianship of Vordakai's tomb was all but forgotten, transformed into territorial aggression around [[Human]] lands, and was not resumed even after Taldor abandoned the Stolen Lands.
>  Soon after colonists from [[Restov]] established [[Varnhold]] in the Stolen Lands, the treasure hunter Willas Gundarson discovered Vordakai's tomb and stole a jade 'bracelet' (actually Vordakai's [[ring]]), in the process activating the tomb's [[magical]] wards and awakening Vordakai from his slumber. Using his oracular powers to track down his ring and the thief, Vordakai located both in Varnhold, imprisoned the town's inhabitants in *[[soul jars]]*, and began to plan to establish a new empire.
