> A beautiful, redheaded young woman, **Minesqa Rovoyosh** came to the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] river town of [[Belila]] in [[4711 AR]], claiming to have come from [[Iobaria]]. She brought with her a new faith called the [[Way of Transcendent Bliss]]. In the beginning the people scoffed at her ecstatic gibberish and her multicolored silks, seemingly impervious to winter's winds, but two years after more than half the town has converted to her strange new faith, the [[Frederyka Elvanna|Baroness Frederyka]] and baron [[Boalloc]] included. In truth, she is devoted to the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Sifkesh]] and is converting the town to demon-worship.
