> **Mirta Straelock** was born and bred in [[Ravengro]] and is now one of the four members of the [[Ravengro Council]], the ruling body of the town located in the [[Canterwall]] county of the nation of [[Ustalav]]. As a local with few airs and graces, most of the population find Mirta the easiest of the council members to approach. She was once the owner of the town's tavern: the [[Laughing Demon]]. and her home is on the southern outskirts of the town.
