 Avalexi
> **Avalexi** is a [[Succubus|succubus]] living in [[Magnimar]] who has inhabited the abandoned [[Shrine of Sarenrae Magnimar|shrine of Sarenrae]] in the [[Underbridge]] district. She has gathered to her two main allies—her [[Half-fiend|half-fiend]] [[Gargoyle|gargoyle]] son, called the [[Scarlet Son]], and [[Zadendi]], a corrupted priestess of [[Sarenrae]]. When outside of the shrine, she disguises herself as the son of a minor noble house, calling herself Lev Avai. Avalexi is particularly fond of corrupting and sacrificing worshippers of Sarenrae, and offering her such a person is a good way to gain Avalexi's favour.


## History

> Before moving to Magnimar, Avalexi was trapped in a statue for millennia in a cave within the [[Mushfens]]. She was finally freed by a tribe of [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]] on the hunt for treasure; she rewarded them for her release by not killing them. She moved to Magnimar in the hopes of building a cult dedicated to [[Shax]], The Blood Marquis: [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of envy, lies and murder. In this endeavour, she hopes to regain the favour of her demon lord.
> Why Avalexi was imprisoned in the Mushfens and why she has such a dedicated hatred of all things Sarenite is not well known.
