> The [[Wizard|wizard]] **Mulrach-Zeer** was chosen by [[Sidrah Imeruss]] as her second-in-command in the [[Technic League]]. He had demonstrated great enthusiasm for what Sidrah taught but it was proved that he was a fearful man who longed for power. In [[4509 AR]], soon after the group finally began their exploration into [[Silver Mount]], Mulrach-Zeer assassinated Sidrah and then addressed his confederates and declared himself the new head of the Technic League. Despite his extensive knowledge in [[Technology|technology]], Mulrach-Zeer and his group spent three more years to breach the metallic walls and enter the Silver Mount, in [[4512 AR]]. The Technic League's exploration inside the Silver Mount has progressed slowly but continuously since then and the group, armed with potent [[Magic|magic]] and powerful technology, took control of [[Starfall]] and began its domination of [[Numeria]].
