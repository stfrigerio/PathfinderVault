> **Briff Bellows** was a [[Galt|Galtan]] raconteur and [[Pathfinder]] who attempted to breach the secrecy of [[Hermea]] some time around [[4659 AR]]. Neither Briff nor his crew were heard from again, and the [[Grand Lodge]] of the [[Pathfinder Society]] considers his expedition lost at sea.
> Briff survived the landing on Hermea's eastern coast, however, and he and the other survivors were incorporated into the [[Glorious Endeavor]].
