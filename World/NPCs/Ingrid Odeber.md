> **Ingrid Odeber** is an [[Andoran|Andoren]] [[Paladin|paladin]] who commands the [[Diamond Regiment]] that patrols the area of [[Darkmoon Vale]].



## Appearance

> Ingrid is a beautiful woman of Andoran descent.  She has pale skin and long blonde hair falling below her waist and bangs.  She is dressed in an Andoren [[Eagle Knight]] uniform with the insignia of the Diamond Regiment over her left breast.


## Family

> Ingrid is a member of the [[Odeber family]].  It is common knowledge that she is married to Tablic, the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] in charge of the [[Greenfire Circle]].  This connection has led a strong level of cooperation between the regiment and the Circle along with the Fangwatch.


## Secrets

> Little known is the fact that Ingrid Odeber is a naturally born [[Werebear|werebear]].  Due to the fact that the most common type of [[Lycanthrope|lycanthropes]] in Darkmoon Vale are the chaotic evil [[Werewolves|werewolves]], she keeps this fact a secret, as some people may not understand (or care) about the difference.
