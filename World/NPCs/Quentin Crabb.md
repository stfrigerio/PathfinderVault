> **Quentin Crabb** serves as the leader of the [[Collectors of the Abattoir]] from their home, the [[Blissful Abattoir]] in the [[Pauper's Palace|Paupers Palace]] district of [[Vyre]]. Quentin is a secret worshipper of [[Norgorber]] in his aspect as the Gray Master but hides his dark faith, pretending instead to worship an obscure [[Psychopomp|psychopomp]] [[Psychopomp usher|usher]]. He has become so convincing in this role that he has fooled even investigators from the [[Pharasma|Church of Pharasma]]. As the leader of the Collectors of the Abattoir, Quentin is responsible for keeping the cult's secrets buried, its darkest one being that the Collectors sell the corpses they claim to cremate to all manner of sinister customers.
