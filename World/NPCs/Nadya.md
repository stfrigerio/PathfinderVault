> **Baroness Nadya** is the ruler of the small town [[Dalun]] in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of [[Wintercrux]]. She has tried to foster stable trading relations with [[Southmoor]] and [[Varisia]] but not with great success. Dalun is responsible for supplying [[Redtooth]] and [[Saarbotten]] with grain and other foodstuffs. Nadya's bloodthirsty sister, [[Urgalaena]], baroness of Saarbotten, often sabotages Nadya's diplomatic attempts.
> Lady Nadya's chief steward, [[Betrona Harcatha]], is actually a spy for her sister Urgalaena.
