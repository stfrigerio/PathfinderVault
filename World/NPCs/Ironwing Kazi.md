> **Ironwing Kazi** is the name the people gave to the [[Griffon|griffon]] mount of a [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] who together act as guardians of the [[Barrowood]] in [[Cheliax]], based near the town of [[Dekarium]]. The druid rider and his griffon patrol the land and attack [[Devil|devil]]-worshipers. Ironwing Kazi is renowned not only for her [[Silver|silver]] fur and gray wings, but for her complete trust in her rider and the fierce manner in which she protects him. Her talons are sharper than [[Sword|swords]] and often patrols the forest alone seeking out [[Evil|evil]] [[Human|humans]] and slaying them with savage might.
