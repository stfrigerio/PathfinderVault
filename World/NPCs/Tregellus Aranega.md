> **Tregellus Aranega** is the Grand Druid, or head, of the [[Green Faith]], [[Golarion|Golarions]] oldest religion. He lives in the [[Anferita Wood]] north of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Corentyn]].
> Despite his advanced age and near blindness, Tregellus has served as Grand Druid for nearly four decades and he remains quick-witted and healthy. He travels regularly from grove to grove to advise (and admonish) the Great Druids and Archdruids of each location. His goal is to find a successor with the drive and vision to take the mantle of Grand Druid, but despairs at the lack of challengers.
