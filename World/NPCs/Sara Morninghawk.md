> **Sara Morninghawk** is a councilor of the small town of [[Trunau]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. She is the owner of the [[Clamor]] smithy and oversees all of the metalwork for the town instructing several apprentices. She always carries her mother's axe strapped to her back. Sara is the daughter of a [[Shoanti]] woman who arrived in Trunau already pregnant and didn't like talking about her past. Sara's marriage to the [[Dwarf|dwarf]] [[Agrit Staginsdar]] causes comments by some folks in town which are answered cheerfully by her.
