> **King Talhrik the Industrious** tried to inject the spirit and ethics of [[Dwarf|dwarvendom]] back into his people. Upon King Talhrik's death in [[4'7 AR]], his son, [[Garbold Talhrik]], was crowned but only after much infighting and passionate negotiation. Unfortunately King Talhrik's son became a victim of treachery by his cousin [[Ordrik Talhrik]] in [[4369 AR]], who was a [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Droskar]].
