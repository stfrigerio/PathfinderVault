> **Queen of Whispers Simandu** serves as one of the [[Kings and Queens of Vyre|Queens]] of [[Vyre]], the rulers of the City of Masks who hide their identities carefully from their subjects. As Queen of Whispers, Simandu controls the announcements made within Vyre as well as managing the flow of information and secrets that pass through the city; she also must protect the reputation of the city and its most powerful citizens. Unbeknownst to all her fellow Kings and Queens of Vyre (except her fellow devotee [[Delaraius Solzakarr|King of Keys Delaraius Solzakarr]]), Simandu is a dedicated follower of [[Norgorber]]. She is also a [[Bestiary/Jorogumo|jorogumo]], a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spider]]-like shapeshifter renowned as seductive schemers. Simandu is served by the [[Masks of Whispers]], a dedicated group that assists her in her duties as Queen of Whispers.
