> **Banny Harker** was a young man who lived in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of [[Sandpoint]], along the [[Lost Coast]]. He worked with his partner, [[Ibor Thorn]], in the [[Sandpoint Lumber Mill]], until he (along with his girlfriend [[Katrine Vinder]]) was ritually killed in his place of employ by the [[Undead|undead]] [[Aldern Foxglove]]. After his death, Harker was implicated by Thorn for embezzling from the Scarnetti family, owners of the mill.
