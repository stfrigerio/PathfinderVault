> Former world-travelling [[Adventurer|adventurer]] **Sir Canayven Heidmarch** is the owner and operator of one of the [[Pathfinder Society|Pathfinder Societys]] newest [[Pathfinder lodge|lodges]]—[[Heidmarch Manor]]. Canayven runs the relatively small Heidmarch Manor, which is located in the wealthy [[Naos]] district of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]], with his wife and lifelong adventuring companion [[Sheila Heidmarch]]. Canayven and Sheila moved to Magnimar after they retired from adventuring but, rather than leading a sheltered life, they have opened their manor up as a Pathfinder Lodge, allowing the Society access to the relatively unexplored lands of Varisia that teem with unexplored [[Thassilon]] ruins.
