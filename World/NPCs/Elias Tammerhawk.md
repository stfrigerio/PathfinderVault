> The most improbable crimelord in [[Riddleport]], **Elias Tammerhawk** is both an accomplished [[Wizard|mage]] and scoundrel. Tammerhawk has been elected speaker of the [[Order of Cyphers]] for two consecutive eight-year terms, and his power shows no sign of waning.
> Through manipulation and the will to deal with rivals, he has become the most powerful of the [[Pirate|pirate]] town's crimelords. If [[Gaston Cromarcky]] dies, Tammerhawk is most likely to take his place as overlord.
> After recent events showed him the threat posed by the legacy of [[Thassilon]] to [[Varisia]], he had a change of heart and achieved quick success in his study as a [[Cyphermage prestige class|Cyphermage]], due to his choice to specialise in the [[Magic/Divination|divination]] [[School of magic|school of magic]] not acknowledged by ancient Thassilonian [[Wizard|wizards]].
