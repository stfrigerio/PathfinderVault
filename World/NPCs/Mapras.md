> **Mapras** was a [[Rakshasa|rakshasa]] who killed and took on the guise of Lord [[Garath Arkona]] in [[4460 AR]], and led [[House Arkona]] to a period of vice-fueled financial wealth and power in [[Korvosa]] until his own death at the hands of his children in [[4704 AR]].


## Relatives

> Mapras and his mate Dandra, who had taken on the guise of Garath's brother Jenkson Arkona, had several children, including the two who killed them: [[Bahor]] and [[Vimanda]].


## Background

> Mapras and Dandra returned to Korvosa on Garath's ship, the *[[Reprieve]]*, laden with Vudran luxuries that they sold for a fortune in Korvosa. While their newfound wealth rivaled even House Jeggare's, the disguised Arkonas spent it in controlling and investing in Korvosa's markets of vice (and indulging in them as well). The Arkonas' reign apparently ended abruptly in [[4483 AR]], when both Garath and Jenkson disappeared and left their house in the hands of previously unknown children, but these "children" were simply new guises for their rakshasa dopplegangers to avoid being found out as [[Immortal|immortal]] beings.
> The replaced Garath established patriarchical control over House Arkona, a tradition that continued for the centuries after his disappearance. The house also always has two leaders, mirroring his control alongside his brother, with the second serving as the family's face among nobles. They established themselves so deeply on [[Endrin Isle]] that by the end of the Cousins' War, only their noble house remained on it.
> After his death at the hands of his children, the guise of Lord [[Glorio Arkona]] that Mapras had adopted was taken up by Bahor.
