> **Pharaoh Hirkoshek II** was the ruler of [[Osirion|Ancient Osirion]] sometime during the -1st century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]]. He was a part of a minor pharaonic dynasty that included [[Hirkoshek I]] (its founder), Zahur I, and the infamous [[Kamaria the Brazen]]. His pyramid stands within sight of the city of [[An]], and due to its obvious location, was looted centuries ago.
