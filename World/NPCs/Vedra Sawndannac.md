> **Military Governor Vedra Sawndannac** commands the [[Chelish Navy|Chelish Navys]] blockade of [[Pezzack]] from its [[Ship|flagship]], the *Reprisal*. Sent to the town in [[4710 AR]] to retake the city from rebels, she has held the stifling naval blockade steady ever since.



## Appearance

> Sawndannac has a prominent chin and pale [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelaxian]] complexion, her black hair cut in a short and utilitarian style. Her throat bears the scar of a strangling attempt while suppressing a mutiny, with smaller scars on her hands from her victories as a duelist and fighter.


## Personality

> Sawndannac is polite, ruthless, and patient. She plots a careful and deliberate strategy against the Pezzacki rebels by withholding vital goods and enticing its people to turn against each other by selling marked-up goods to any willing to buy from the Navy (and expose themselves as traitors to the insurrection).


## Relatives

> She is a distant cousin of [[Cheliax|Cheliaxs]] [[Queen Abrogail Thrune II]].
