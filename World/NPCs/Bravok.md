> **Councilor Bravok** is a [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Desna]] in the small [[Half-orc|half-orc]] town of [[Averaka]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. He often travels to other [[Linnorm Kingdoms]], [[Varisia]] and beyond, spreading the word of Averaka among half-orcs to recruit more settlers. Bravok presides over Averaka's largest temple, a simple stone building that affords worship to all usual non-evil half-orc deities, such as [[Gorum]] and [[Calistria]], but also Desna, [[Cayden Cailean]], and [[Erastil]].
