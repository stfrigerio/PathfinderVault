> **Glungur the Mighty** is a [[Fiendish creature|fiendish]] [[Marsh giant|marsh giant]] who carries the title [[Cleric|High Priest]] of [[Kostchtchie]] and rules the [[Demon|demon-infested]] ruins of [[Dyinglight]] in the [[Worldwound]]. A natural sadist, Glungur loves the taste of [[Human|human]] flesh and often hunts them (or sends others off to hunt for him) in the [[Frostmire Fen]] that surrounds Dyinglight. Since the closing of the Worldwound at the end of the [[Fifth Mendevian Crusade]] in [[4718 AR]], his current fate remains unknown, although it is known that fiendish giants still surround Dyinglight.
