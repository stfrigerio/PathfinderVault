> **Katrezra** is a gnarled old [[Half-orc|half-orc]] who is a long-standing resident of the [[Sanctuary]] in the small town of [[Trunau]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. He was raised among the [[Empty Hand tribe]] and suffers from a terrible affliction of the lungs and weeping sores on his face and arms gained when the chieftain of the [[Orc|orc]] tribe sent him to the [[Brimstone Haruspex]] to get painful visions of the future. [[Halgra]] granted him sanctuary and he has since become a follower of [[Iomedae]]. He has proven his loyalty countless times on the town's walls. He still occasionally has visions and the matron of the sanctuary [[Tyari Varvatos]] has begun privately recording them on the chance that they may point toward an important revelation.
