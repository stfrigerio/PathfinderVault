> The [[Alchemist|alchemist]] **Vumeshki** is the author of the book of poems  entitled *[[Songs at Sun's Ebb|Songs at Suns Ebb]]*. The most well known of those poems is *Ilvarandin*, which tells of a utopia deep beneath the earth.
> In fact, Vumeshki was one of the first victims of the drug [[Midnight milk|midnight milk]]. Under its influence he was convinced that Ilvarandin was an earthy paradise of eternal youth. In fact, the underground city of [[Ilvarandin]] is the hunting ground of the [[Intellect devourer|intellect devourers]], and the drug was created by them to provide a means of eating the minds of surface dwellers.
> Vumeshki's brain was devoured by the intellect devourer [[Tiluatchek]], using the drug as a gateway. Tiluatchek took over Vumeshki's body, and physically moved it into Ilvarandin. 
> Tiluatchek has since moved on to many other bodies, but keeps Vumeshki's body (among others) hidden away in [[High Ilvarandin]] in case he should ever have need of it.
