> The cruel mandrill-headed [[Raja rakshasa|raja rakshasa]] **Bedu Hanji** rules the [[Rampore Isles]] in the [[Shackles]] from his sprawling palace in [[Ghrinitshahara]]. The town once resembled the hamlets of the distant [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]], home to the Vudran mariners that established the settlement. In [[4662 AR]] three rakshasas, fleeing bounties placed on their heads by a powerful [[Rajah|rajah]], managed to infiltrate Rampore's loose organization. Within 2 years the three [[Evil|evil]] [[Outsider|outsiders]] assassinated or imprisoned all rival Vudran [[Pirate lord|pirate lords]]. The boldest of the three was Bedu Hanji who managed to do away with his equally treacherous partners and became the master of the isles. Ghrinitshahara became the center of a thriving business around the trade of [[Humanoid|humanoid]] [[Slavery|slaves]].
> Hanji captains the massive [[Ship|galleon]] *[[Semudarogah]]* (or *Sea Plague* in [[Vudrani language|Vudrani]]). For two months of the year Hanji and a large part of Rampore's fleet sail north around the [[Eye of Abendego]], pillaging merchant vessels as far away as [[Varisia]]. They also raid the coastlines to secure fresh humanoid cargo for Hanji's thriving slave-training camps. Hanji leaves Ghrinitshahara in the hands of three cruel lieutenants, [[Cuha Cahora]], [[Rakhna]], and [[Vesyapremi]]. Each of these lieutenants is devoted to Hanji and harbors a burning hatred for the other two.
> Hanji is in a fierce conflict with [[Bag Island]]. Captured sailors of Bag Island [[Ship|ships]] are crucified on the southern shoreline of the largest of the Rampore islands which Hanji himself maliciously named the [[Halfling Coast]].
