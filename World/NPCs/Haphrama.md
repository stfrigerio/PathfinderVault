> **Haphrama** was the penultimate [[Runelords|Runelord]] of Greed and ruler of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] realm of [[Shalast]] before [[Earthfall]], ruling for 103 years from [[-5862 AR]] to [[-5759 AR]]. His apprentice [[Karzoug]], with the aid of allies from [[Leng]], overthrew and succeeded him as the Runelord of Greed and attempted to erase all mentions of Haphrama—and his renowned [[Spellbook|spellbook]], the *Runes of Wealth*—from the Thassilonian historical record.
