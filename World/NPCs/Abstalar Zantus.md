> When the [[Sandpoint chapel]] burnt to the ground in [[4702 AR]], killing the town's priest, [[Ezakien Tobyn]], his position in the town was filled by his top acolyte, Abstalar Zantus. Though Father Zantus is himself a [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Desna]], his role as high-priest requires him to be open to other faiths, and he is more than willing and open to assist followers of other gods with spiritual matters.
