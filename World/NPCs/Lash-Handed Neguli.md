> **Lash-Handed Neguli** was the founder of the [[Okeno Slavers]] confederation in [[3721 AR]], the [[Year of Rent Sails]]. [[Andoran|Andoren]] sailors had become a major threat for the [[Slavery|slavers]] in the [[Inner Sea]] when Lash-Handed Neguli, captain of the [[Ship|galley]] *[[Hundred Oars]]*, rallied his fellow slavers and directed vicious attacks against the Andoren sailors. In the Year of Rent Sails the slavers hit hard trade ships, warships and even pirate ships that entered [[Okeno|Okenos]] harbor but refused to ally with Neguli. Overland raids increased as well. When the year was over a strong solidified group, called the Okeno Slavers had been formed.
