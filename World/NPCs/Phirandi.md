> **Phirandi** was the ninth and penultimate [[Runelords|runelord of envy]] and ruler of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] realm of [[Edasseril]], reigning from [[-5489 AR]] to [[-5402 AR]]. He was a practitioner of the [[Sin magic|sin magic]] of envy, now known as [[PathfinderWiki/Magic/Abjuration|abjuration]].
> Impressed by her rapid rise through the nation's bureaucracy, Phirandi took on his future successor [[Belimarius]] as an apprentice. She [[Poison|poisoned]] his other apprentices, eventually stripped him of his many magical defenses, and imprisoned the still alive Phirandi within a transparent coffin of force on display in her Palace Miasmoria throne room for the remainder of her reign.
> Phirandi died at an unspecified time in the reign of Belimarius. By the time of [[Earthfall]], nothing remained inside Phirandi's coffin but his long-dead corpse, which was trapped inside [[Crystilan]] alongside the rest of [[Xin-Edasseril]] during Belimarius' botched attempt to create a *[[Runewell|runewell]]*.
