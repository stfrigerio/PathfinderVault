> **Paishnia** of the [[Shining Mountains]] in [[Osirion]] is a proud female [[Griffon|griffon]] who is often seen on the hills overlooking the [[Asp River]] and the [[River Sphinx]]. Some people believe Paishnia guards a treasure in the hills in which she resides though the skeptics say that she is simply waiting for a mate. Whatever the truth is, Paishnia has been known to attack those who trespass too deeply into the Shining Mountains in search of gold and other riches. Paishnia can be temporarily distracted with offerings of horsemeat.
