> **Kilarin Salk** is one of the most insufferable of [[Thuldrin Kreed|Thuldrin Kreeds]] agents. She is a middle-aged, failed farmer who personally inspects all groceries sold in the [[High Market]] of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]]. Kilarin is notoriously corrupt and farmers in the region know that a hefty bribe is required to pass her inspection. Any insult to her pride results in a lifetime ban from selling goods in Falcon's Hollow.
