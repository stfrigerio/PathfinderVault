> **First Speaker for the Council Onishi Kazujun** is ostensibly the ruler of the [[Tian Xia]] nation of [[Tianjing]], but the reality is a little more complicated. Onishi does not wield absolute power like many rulers do, but instead he serves as the spokesperson for a council of [[Aasimar's Mercy|aasimar]] elders who rule Tianjing. Onishi himself is a devout follower of the [[Deity|goddess]] [[Shelyn]], so-called Lady of Chrysanthemums.
