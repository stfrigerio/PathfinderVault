> **Stengrim Ring-Forger** is the master of the [[Kopparberget]] copper mine in the [[Southmoor]] region of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. The mine is under the control of [[Kalsgard]] and is operated under the stewardship of the Kopparberget [[Dwarf|dwarves]]. Recent delves by the dwarves accidentally broke through into [[Nar-Voth]], opening the mine to [[Duergar|duergar]] tunnels. The duergar invaded the lower levels, conquered several deep excavations and the entire mine became a battleground. Presently, the two groups have reached a stalemate, fortifying their areas and probing each other's positions using scouting groups. Stengrim ordered the construction of copper-plated [[Clockwork golem|clockwork golems]] to patrol their tunnels and has also put out a call to mercenaries throughout the north lands to work in Kopparberget, promising a good reward.
