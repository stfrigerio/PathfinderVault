> **Aylunna Varvatos** is the former Second Sword Knight in [[Cathedral of Sancta Iomedaea]] in [[Vigil]], having presided over worship for more than 10 years. After surviving the destruction of Vigil and fall of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], she relocated to [[Vellumis]], and currently oversees the defence of the city and evacuation of former Lastwall citizens to [[Absalom]] with the help of [[Magaambya|Magaambyan]] volunteers.


## Appearance

> Aylunna is a short woman whose soft eyes are surrounded by crow's feet.


## Relatives

> Her younger sister [[Tyari Varvatos]] has decided to move to the dangerous frontier town of [[Trunau]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]] to create her own name rather than live in her sister's shadow.
