> **Bahor** is the leader of [[House Arkona]], one of the most powerful noble families in [[Korvosa]]. Publicly known as **Glorio Arkona**, he is in truth a powerful [[Raja rakshasa|raja rakshasa]] taking the guise of a [[Human|human]].



## Appearance

> Although he can take any human form, Bahor's preferred form is that of a handsome [[Vudrani]] man with shoulder-length black hair and a trimmed goatee and moustache.


## Background

> Bahor was born to the rakshasa couple [[Mapras]] and Dandra. His parents were originally from [[Vudra]], and settled in Korvosa after murdering and stealing the identities of the original human members of House Arkona when they came to Vudra. In [[4704 AR]], Bahor and his sister [[Vimanda]] murdered their parents and took over their leadership of House Arkona.
> Just a few years after overthrowing his parents, Bahor became bored of his successes and started scheming to take over Korvosa for himself. However, his plan was threatened when [[Ileosa Arabasti|Queen Ileosa Arabasti]] murdered her husband, [[Eodred Arabasti II|King Eodred Arabasti II]], and endangered the entire city.


## Associates

> Bahor and his sister work alongside several other rakshasas from Vudra who wish to see their grand experiment in Korvosa. They are served by [[Magic|magically]] controlled human servants who know them only as mundane mob bosses.
