> **Gartheris** was a famed [[Green dragon|green dragon]] [[Astronomer|astronomer]] and the discoverer of numerous [[Celestial body|celestial bodies]], including several [[Comet|comets]] and two of the [[Planet|planets]] within [[Golarion]]'s [[Solar system|solar system]]. However, a team of [[Human|human]] astronomers disseminated his discoveries before he could, naming the two planets [[Triaxus]] and [[Apostae]] and denying him this honor. Gartheris and his colleagues seethed for nearly a century before wiping out the astronomers, their publishers, and their families in revenge.
> Gartheris had at least one daughter, [[Athervox]], who worked in his shadow through her youth. When Gartheris passed away, he left his notes and equipment to his daughter, who used them to further her own astronomical research.
