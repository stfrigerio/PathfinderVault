>  **Pharaoh Azghaad**—known as [[Osirion's]] **First Pharaoh**, **Azghaad the All-Seeing** or **Azghaad I**—was the legendary first [[Pharaoh]] of Osirion from [[Ancient Osirion's]] founding, under the guidance of the god-king [[Nethys]], in [[-3470 AR]] at the dawn of the [[Age of Destiny]]. It was Azghaad who founded [[Sothis]] and made it the capital of Osirion, a prestigious position it retains to this day. It is rumored that [[Azghaad's Spire]] in Sothis holds a piece of his royal tomb supposedly topped by the capstone of his ancient pyramid. This implies that whoever built Azghaad's Spire must have known where Azghaad's original tomb is buried, a worthy target for any treasure hunter as surely the tomb of the First Pharaoh must contain treasure unknown to the modern world.


## History

>  Azghaad is said to have founded the nation of Osirion with the help of Nethys himself. During his early reign he united the many tribes along the [[River Sphinx]], defeated the might [[Spawn of Rovagug]] [[Ulunat]] and founded the city of Sothis around the gigantic beetle's carapace. In [[-3399 AR]], he completed construction on a spectacular temple to Nethys and proclaimed him Osirion's first patron [[god]], thereby ushering in the [[First Age of Osirion]].
