> **Rjul** is the koffar of the former capital of [[Iobaria]], [[Antoll]], as well as the *de facto* despot of the entire [[Nyvyrd|Nyvyrd region]]. His family owns the forges of [[Veka]], and through that he controls all forged metal weapons and goods, and the military, of the region. He is currently interested in aligning with [[Orlov|Orlovs]] [[Tzakiv Korya|Prince Tzakiv]], so long as he can maintain his own power base in the north. He has sent troops and spies to Antoll in an attempt to "keep the peace" and strengthen his hold over the city.
