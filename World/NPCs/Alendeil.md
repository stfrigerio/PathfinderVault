> **Alendeil** was a farmer in [[Kyonin]] who became a refugee of [[Treerazer|Treerazers]] [[Demon|demonic]] invasion in [[2497 AR]]. He fled to [[Imvrildara]], a [[Calistria|Calistrian]] temple, where he became a priest of the order.
> Treerazer eventually expanded its invasion and sent the [[Nalfeshnee|nalfeshnee]] [[Echataxun]] on a mission to destroy the temple, which had become a stronghold against demonic influence. Alendeil battled Echataxun‎ alone and defeated it through a miracle of Calistria that sealed the demon in stone.
> Alendeil then committed the rest of his centuries of life to opposing Treerazer and preparing the temple's order, now known as the [[Imvrildarai]], to defend itself.
