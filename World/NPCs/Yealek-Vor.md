> **Yealek-Vor** is a [[Kalavakus|kalavakus]] [[Demon|demon]] who dwells in the ancient [[Sky Citadel]] of [[Jormurdun]] in the [[Worldwound]], where he leads a population of [[Duergar|duergar]] in the search for [[Dwarf|dwarven]] artifacts.


## History

> Yealek-Vor entered [[Golarion]] relatively recently in the hopes of increasing the prestige and influence of his [[Shivaska|demonic patroness]] across the Worldwound. He first joined the armies of [[Deskari]] as a mercenary, and while serving there discovered a masonry fragment in a destroyed temple of [[Torag]]. It revealed that the long-forgotten Sky Citadel of Jormurdun might be located somewhere nearby. After destroying the stone to keep its secret safe, Yealek-Vor abandoned the war and took up the search for the lost dwarven city-fortress, which he discovered in [[4689 AR]].


## Goals

> The horned demon continues his search for ancient dwarven artifacts within the Sky Citadel, hoping to parlay their power into greater fame and recognition for Shivaska. He and his duergar minions work in secret, not wishing to reveal themselves until they have successfully retrieved the artifacts from Jormurdun's depths.
