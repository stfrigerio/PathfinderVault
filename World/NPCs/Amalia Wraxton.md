> **Amalia Wraxton** is a seditious playwright hiding in [[Pezzack]]. The disastrous debut of her satirical play *[[Abrogail I]]* at the Glass on the Hill in [[4710 AR]] sparked a destructive, violent rebellion in Pezzack.
> Before coming to Pezzack, Wraxton survived betrayal in an ill-fated group of rebels during the [[Chelish Civil War]] and spent time in [[Galt]] attempting to learn how to incite a rebellion. In Galt, she read the satirical play *When Gods Fall* by Pezzacki playwright Indageous Vonor, which inspired her to travel to the city and become one of his students.
> While her works inspired [[Andoran|Andorens]] and Galtans to join the Pezzacki insurrection, it was *Abrogail I* that led to the city's [[Second Ashes]], an uprising that resulted in the deaths of Vonor and actress Valeria Minish, the destruction of much of the city, and the [[Chelish Navy|Chelish Navys]] subsequent blockade.
> Her theater company, the [[Fine Company]], now serves as her bodyguards, and her continued works—particularly the long-awaited followup *[[Abrogail II]]*—inspire insurgent groups such as Pezzack's [[White Thistle]].
