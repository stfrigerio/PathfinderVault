> **Grandfather Pei** was the leader of the revolution in which [[Pen Wa|Pen Wa Province]] seceded from [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]], and the founder of the state of [[Bachuan]]. A peasant-scholar of humble origins, Grandfather formulated the political philosophy of [[Communism|communism]], rallying the common folk of Pen Wa against the corrupt Lung Wa priests and politicians, successfully establishing the Republic of Bachuan as an independent nation in [[4606 AR]].
> Grandfather governed Bachuan as the head of the [[Sun Chamber]] for the rest of his life, presiding over the construction of the new capital city, [[Peijia]]. In theory, his new system of government was meant to lead to the equality of all citizens, but after his marriage to Pu Yae Men, better known as [[Grandmother Pei]], his premiership took a violent turn, marked by prison camps and ideological purges; most blamed his young sixth wife for this turn. With Grandfather's death (peacefully, in his sleep) at the age of 101 in [[4668 AR]], Bachuan was left fully in the hands of his zealous, warmongering widow.
