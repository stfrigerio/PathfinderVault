> **Chadric of Laekastel** lives in the only stone building in the ramshackle town of [[Yelligo Wharf]] on island of [[Dahak's Tooth|Dahaks Tooth]]. Former captain of the *[[Baleful Glare]]*, he is the apparent leader of the business run in Yelligo Wharf. He represents himself as the only agent the [[Cult of Dahak]] will accept. The [[Pirate|pirate]] crews who prey on the [[Ship|ships]] sailing between [[Shenchu Bay]] and the mainland coast give Chadric a big share of the cult's payments. [[Chak-Chak]] is a servile [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]] that hangs around Chadric's place, quietly pocketing a coin once in a while. Chadric keeps the tengu close by, superstitiously believing him to be the bringer of good luck.
