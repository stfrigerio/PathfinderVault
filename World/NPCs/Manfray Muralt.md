> **Count Manfray Muralt** once ruled over the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] province of [[Odranto]] and harboured a terrible secret: he was partially possessed by the ancient [[Necromancer|necromancer]] Iselin Odranti. This [[Unholy|unholy]] possession had been passed down like a [[Curse|curse]] from generation to generation ever since the refounding of Ustalav after the end of the [[Shining Crusade]]. Manfray, however, would prove to be the last pure-blooded descendant of House Muralt as he was unable to father children. Iselin, for reasons unknown even to him, was only able to exert his [[Undead|undead]] influence over those of the ancient Odranti bloodline so, together with Manfray's forced assistance, they researched forgotten family histories and ancient genealogies.
> In the end, Manfray and Iselin found a possible new heir, a male son of a forgotten branch of the family that had settled near [[Ardagh]]. Manfrey arranged to adopt this child, [[Conwrest Muralt|Conwrest]], but when Iselin tried to posses Conwrest, his attempts failed, something to do with a thinning of the blood. Searching the family histories, they located another distant relation, Lyrabella. After scheming to bring about her family's doom, Manfray and Iselin also adopted Lyrella as a step-daughter, aiming to reunite the disparate branches of the family tree and sire a new heir fully susceptible to Iselin's influence. This plan continues, despite Manfray's death, with Conwrest and Lyrabella who fell in love and married before his passing.
