> **Garen Aldori** serves as blademaster of the [[Aldori Academy]], the famed school of swordplay in [[Brevoy]] that trains [[Aldori swordlords]]. Although he is aging and has not publicly dueled in years, he is a demanding teacher who enforces the order's high standards and time-honored traditions on the academy's pupils, and is known to be stingy with his praise. He is rivals with [[Tieldlara]], an [[Elf|elven]] upstart swordlord known for flaunting the order's traditional emphasis on discipline (and particularly Garen's own); their eventual duel is expected to be spectacular, and Garen's age and Tieldlara's lack of discipline grant neither of them a clear advantage.
