> **Vexnill** was the daughter of the treasurer under [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Phirandi]] of [[Edasseril]]. After being accepted into the Arcanium Abjurant, she was murdered by the future [[Belimarius|Runelord Belimarius]], who envied her position and wanted to take her place. Vexnill lingered behind as a mischievous [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]], annoyed at Belimarius (who she calls *ol' Belly-face*) for killing her, but not resentful of her status. Since [[Earthfall]], she has been waiting in the Eye of Jealousy for a chance to confront Belimarius, but is unaware of the passage of [[Time|time]].
