> **Qallak** leads a tribe of [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] that claim a large portion of the [[Fangwood 1]] north of the [[Marideth River]] as their sacred ground. Their favorite winter camp is [[Seesaw Rock]]. While not normally confrontational, these centaurs will accost those who trespass on their sacred lands. Qallak himself is easy to anger and forgives slowly.
