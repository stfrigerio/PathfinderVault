> **Blooded Stag** is the bestial [[Rules/Classes/Druid|archdruid]] of the [[Arthfell Forest]] in [[Andoran]]. He leads his fellow congregants in bloody rites and worships the ancient [[Fey|fey]] that inhabit the woods. His callousness and violent behavior toward his [[Human|human]] neighbors who encroach upon his domain have made Blooded Stag an easy target for demonization by the [[Lumber Consortium]].


## Appearance

> The stag-like antlers growing from Blooded Stag's forehead are obvious indicators of his fey ancestry.
