> **Omak** is the former grand matron and spiritual leader of the Six Bears following, which dispersed following the death of her son Marok from the Blackwound Curse. Omak herself is currently resident in a cave close by the source of the [[Little Tusk]] river where she mourns her son. Six Bears following superstition marks her as corrupted by the dead, though many continue to seek her aid as a [[Shaman|shaman]], or Amakor. She is mute, but can still determine someone's innate character worth, guilt, blasphemy, or greatness with a touch and can communicate in a sign language.
