> **Ludoviro Scarpo** is a [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelish]] [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Asmodeus]]. He is known as the son of [[Aspexia Rugatonn]], high priestess of the [[Church of Asmodeus]].
> Ludoviro has long been in the shadow of his mother and now seeks to prove himself without relying on the reputation of his mother. He has tried to do this by taking his father's name when he joined the clergy, but his connections have since become public, much to his frustration.
> Tall and lanky, Ludoviro has an analytical mind and is able to quote much of the [[Asmodean Monograph]] from memory. His brow is creased and wrinkled, a byproduct of intense concentration. His current goal is to become an imperial inquisitor, although he is concerned that any success may be due more to his mother's reputation rather than his own abilties.
