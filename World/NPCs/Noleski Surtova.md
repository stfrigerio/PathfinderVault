> **King Noleski Surtova** is [[Brevoy|Brevoys]] current ruler. He has reigned over the divided nation since [[4699 AR]], when [[Urzen Rogarvia|King Urzen Rogarvia]], along with all members of [[House Rogarvia]], mysteriously disappeared in an event known as the [[Vanishing]]. Prior to taking the [[Dragonscale Throne]] in [[New Stetven]], Surtova ruled [[Port Ice]], as have members of [[House Surtova]] for more than a thousand years.



## Titles

> King Noleski holds numerous titles, including King of All Brevoy in the Name of [[Choral the Conqueror|Choral]], Lord of [[Issia]], Prince of [[Rostland]], Suzerain of [[New Stetven]], Overlord of [[Restov]], Defender of the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]], Regent of the Dragonscale Throne, Blood of the Conqueror, overlord and rightful king of all Brevoy., King-Regent of Brevoy, and Head of House Surtova.


## Family

> King Noleski is a bachelor and has been pressured to marry and produce an heir for years, much to the consternation of his sister, [[Natala Surtova|Natala]].
> The king has a distant cousin, Berislav Surtova, who often works as his ambassador, and acts as House Surtova's lead in the Brevic town of Zmeyka.


## Recent History

> A prospective alliance between House Surtova and [[House Lebeda]] that would have symbolically united Rostland ([[Elanna Lebeda]]) and Issia (King Noleski Surtova) and brought much needed stability to fractured Brevoy, fell apart in [[4718 AR]] when the king's sister, Natala Surtova, accused [[Lander Lebeda|Lord Lander Lebeda]] of treason. Lord Lander disappeared soon thereafter, leaving the would-be bride to return home in humiliation. Since Lord Lander had been accused of harboring revolutionary sentiments numerous times during his youth, most of the Brevic nobility believed the Surtovan accusations. The notable exception were members of [[House Orlovsky]], who claimed that the facts supporting the purported treason were contradictory and unclear, and countered that this was most likely Surtovan propaganda. This has caused a significant fracture between the houses of Surtova and Orlovsky, one that threatens to escalate into armed confrontation.
