> **Kell** is a [[Hell gigas]] who earned the eternal hatred of his species by loyally serving the [[Infernal duke|infernal duke]] [[Uruskreil]] at his forge and sating his appetite for torture by breaking others of his kind to serve [[Hell]]. A merciless warrior, Kell is often sent to the [[Material Plane]] to crush those who offended his master, but regularly disappears for short periods when doing so, something which has not gone unnoticed.
