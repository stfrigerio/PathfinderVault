> **Lonjiku Kaijitsu** was the leader of the Kaijitsu family in [[Sandpoint]] until his death in [[4707 AR]]. He was married to [[Atsuii Kaijitsu]], whom he had murdered [[4702 AR|five years before his death]].


## Background

> Lonjiku was born in [[Magnimar]] to [[Rokuro Kaijitsu]]. His father, born Amatatsu Tsutoku, was the last scion of one of the five royal families of [[Minkai]], and fled his homeland to [[Avistan]] when the [[Oni|oni]] of the Five Storms sought to exterminate them. In order to hide his identity, Rokuro settled in [[Brinewall]] and became a glassblower, and later moved to Magnimar, where he became a member of the city's aristocracy and a co-founder of [[Sandpoint]], but kept the *Amatatsu Seal*, proof of his lineage, in Brinewall, hidden in a *warding box*.
> In [[4687 AR]], at the age of 60, Rokuro brought Lonjiku from Sandpoint to Brinewall to reveal his family legacy to his son. However, as Rokuro was contemplating how to do so, Lonjiku opened the *warding box* himself, exposing the *Amatatsu Seal* to observation. The horrified Rokuro immediately sent Lonjiku with his bodyguard and belongings back on three [[Ship|ships]] to Magnimar; at the same time, the Five Storms, noticing the *Amatatsu Seal*, quickly mobilised its [[Kalsgard]]-based branch, the Frozen Shadows, to raze Brinewall. Off the [[Lost Coast]], the three ships sank in a storm, but Lonjiku survived and drifted back to land after a few weeks. Meanwhile, after destroying Brinewall, the Five Storms failed to discover the hidden vault containing the *Amatatsu Seal*, and as they infiltrated Magnimar and learned about the loss of Rokuro's ships, they falsely assumed that the *Amatatsu Seal* sank with the ships, and the family was now wiped out, as Lonjiku returned to Sandpoint to rebuild his family.
> Lonjiku was killed during a [[Goblin|goblin]] raid in Sandpoint in [[4707 AR]]. The goblins mutilated and encased his corpse in molten glass, and his [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]] continued to haunt the [[Sandpoint Glassworks]] after his death, never manifesting when his daughter was present.


## Relatives

> Lonjiku was a short-tempered, misanthropic man who failed to establish good connections to his children [[Tsuto Kaijitsu|Tsuto]], [[Ameiko Kaijitsu|Ameiko]], and [[Amaya Kaijitsu|Amaya]]—especially the former, a [[Half-elf|half-elf]] whose very existence was open proof of his wife's infidelity. Ameiko, his eldest daughter, was a successful [[Adventurer|adventurer]] and, thereafter, the owner of Sandpoint's [[Rusty Dragon]], but was no source of pride for him either. He rarely saw Amaya, his daughter from an affair with a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] noblewoman in [[Magnimar]], and she took the Kaijitsu family name only after Lonjiku's death.
