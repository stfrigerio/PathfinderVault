> The **Beast of Lepidstadt** is a [[Flesh golem|flesh golem]] from the region of [[Vieland]] in northwestern [[Ustalav]], and as far as the residents of that region are concerned, a menace beyond compare.



## Description

> The Beast is said to be made of the bodies of condemned criminals and while human sized he posses the strength of an [[Ogre|ogre]].


## History

> The Beast of Lepidstadt was created 20 years ago, gaining its name after it committed a series of grizzly murders in the city of [[Lepidstadt]]. The Beast is widely (and incorrectly) believed to have been created by Dr. Henri Moritz of the [[University of Lepidstadt]], as he was its first victim. A number of other high-profile murders have also been attributed to the Beast—all committed with its signature weapon, a vicious [[Ogre hook|ogre hook]].
> In fact, the Beast's true creator, [[Alpon Caromarc|Count Alpon Caromarc]], animated the creature to exact revenge on those who forced him to abdicate rule of Vieland. Though the Beast of Lepidstadt is free-willed, Caromarc can control it through the use of a magical device called the *Bondslave Thrall* that he keeps hidden in [[Schloss Caromarc]], though he has rarely done so in recent years.
> Despite its name, the Beast of Lepidstadt is no animal, but rather an intelligent creature; a flesh golem that has gained sentience. Though the Beast is a fearsome combatant and easily provoked, some claim to have seen the beast recite [[Taldor|Taldan]] poetry and return lost children from the wilderness. The Beast has sought to understand its relationship to the [[Human|humans]] that surround it for as long as it has existed but remains unsure why they hate it so much. The Beast has also recently gained access to a *[[Golem manual|flesh golem manual]]*, which it has been studying in an attempt to overcome its innate rage.
> The Beast of Lepidstadt has not been seen in Lepidstadt for over 5 years and now has gained a new moniker, the Dippelmere Horror, for the [[Dippelmere Swamp]] in which it now resides.
