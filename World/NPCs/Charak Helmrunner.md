> **General Charak Helmrunner** leads the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[Ninth Battalion]], a roving military organization dedicated to the defense and aid of besieged dwarves. He claims [[Gruenak Helmrunner]], legendary hero of the [[Quest for Sky]], as one of his ancestors.


## Background

> After losing much of his clan in an assault from [[Giant|giants]] and a [[Dragon|dragon]], he formed a new clan of dwarven traditionalists aligned behind a common goal of stalwart defense. He is credited with the Battalion's tactical successes, and with coining its motto: "We cede not one more inch of rock."


### Lost Mines

> Charak possesses leads and seeks additional information about the [[Lost Mines]] of the [[Hollow Hills]], believing their disappearance to be an [[Orc|orc]] plot.
