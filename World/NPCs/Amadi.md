> **Amadi** was a kind-hearted and cheerful lad who acted as a guide and as an artist for Count [[Varian Jeggare]] during one of the famous [[Pathfinder]]'s early explorations to the [[Mwangi Expanse]] in the mid 47th Century AR. Amadi's artistic skills were used in preparing Jeggare's book, the *[[Bestiary of Garund]]*. He also acted as a guide to the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] Pathfinder, [[Rosk Hargun]] and the noble Pathfinder, Prince [[Kasiya]], the latter on the prince's exploration of the [[Kaava Lands]].
