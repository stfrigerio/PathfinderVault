> The [[Dero|dero]] savant **Mirgik** rules the [[Dero|dero]] city of [[Kmlin-Bru]] in the [[Darklands]] region of [[Nar-Voth]]. She has organised her people in a militaristic fashion which is unusual for dero, and she has an alliance with Primarch [[Bremovir]], the ruler of the so-called [[Dread Dungeons]] which lie above Kmlin-Bru in [[Galt]].
