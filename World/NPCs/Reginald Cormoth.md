> **General Reginald Cormoth** is the commander of the [[Eagle Knights]] of [[Andoran]], a specialized military division. He also serves as the Lord of the Guardian Tower of the [[Golden Aerie]] in the city of [[Almas]], and is often simply referred to as "The Old Man". He has a knack for strategy and tactics, and is not against bending rules to get the desired result. He smokes [[Recreational drugs of GolarionTobacco|tobacco leaves]], and enjoys going undercover to surprise those under him who are lax at their positions.



## Background

> Born in [[4636 AR]] in [[Claes]], the general trained in the naval academies of [[Augustana]], after which he entered the Andoren Navy. He was inducted as an Eagle Knight after destroying several [[Taldor|Taldan]] [[Ship|slave galleys]]. Before assuming his current position, Cormoth was the operational leader of the Eagle Knights' unacknowledged spy branch, the [[Twilight Talons]]. As Lord Captain Commander, Cormoth strove to diversify the skills and abilities of the Eagle Knights, allowing them to participate in a greater variety of missions. He is now a member of Andoran's ruling body, the [[People's Council|Peoples Council]], where he serves as one of 30 [[Consul|Consuls]].


## Commander of the Eagle Knights

> In his position as commander, Cormoth is in charge of all Eagle Knights operations within Andoran, and serves as an adjunct in domestic, foreign, and intelligence operations performed by the general Andoren military. He is assisted in each of these types of missions by three under-marshals. Under him in the military hierarchy of the Eagle Knights are the leaders of the organization's three branches: [[Hedrik Traxxus|General Traxxus]] of the [[Golden Legion]]; [[Andira Marusek|General Marusek]] of the [[Steel Falcons]]; and [[Helena Trellis|Marshal Helena Trellis]] of the Twilight Talons.

## Foreign relations


### Nirmathas

> Cormoth is a staunch ally and long-standing friend of Nirmathas' leader, [[Weslen Gavirk|Forest Marshal Weslen Gavirk]]; their political [[Philosophy|philosophies]] are similar and they communicate with each other regularly. The personal alliance is backed up by covert shipments to Nirmathas of supplies, [[Armour|armour]], and [[Weapon|weapons]] via [[Druma]] and [[Lake Encarthan]]. Nirmathas' enemy, [[Molthune]], may suspect such traffic but, as yet, has failed to prove it. Thus, Andoran is one of the handful of loyal allies upon which Nirmathas relies, largely due to Cormoth and Gavirk's mutual respect.
