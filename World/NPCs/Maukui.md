> **Maukui** is a particularly devious [[Intellect devourer|intellect devourer]] stationed in the [[Dominion of the Black]] hive in the [[Scar of the Spider]], [[Numeria]]. It wears the skin of a young [[Void dragon|void dragon]] and was responsible for the discovery of [[Casandalee|Casandaleess]] [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] (AI) core.


## History

> Maukui was recruited by the Dominion from an obscure [[Planet|world]] orbiting a dead [[Star|star]]. Due to its creative thinking with regard to the interface of organic and [[Technological|technological]] elements, Maukui was placed in stasis for a few millennia to prepare for its task: investigating the *[[Divinity]]* once it arrived at its destination.
> Maukui awoke when the *Divinity* approached [[Golarion]] and met Paajgat, a [[Sacristan|sacristan]] [[Velstrac|velstrac]] recruited as a specialist thanks to her startling artistry with a razor. Her creativity and gruesome whimsy sat well with Maukui's own cruelty. The Dominion granted Maukui the body of a young void dragon, whose memories it discarded and whose body is prevented from decay by Paajgat's *gentle repose* [[Spell|spells]].
> After a hive was established on Golarion, Maukui was given freedom to indulge in depraved ideas: cybernetic symbiosis, pain extension, ecstatic transmogrification, genetic retrofitting, *etc*., but especially inhabiting bodies other than that of its favourite [[Dragon|dragon]] form, and revelling in hedonism. Eventually, it discovered Casandalee's AI core, which it deduced as a piece of technology beyond that of the Dominion's. It focused its mind on a singular goal: reverse engineer the AI, duplicate it, and infuse organically grown blank brains with intellects, perhaps even with [[Soul|souls]], presenting a host of new opportunities for the Dominion while rising higher in the Dominion's ranks. However, after many years, Maukui failed to understand how the AI's mind worked until its superior, the [[Yah-thelgaad|yah-thelgaad]] Dweller-In-Dark-Places, grew impatient and confiscated the core to try more invasive procedures.
> Maukui resented how its greatest enigma was taken away, and hoped to steal Casandalee back before fleeing the Dominion. It developed a way to block observation of its chamber in such a way that Dweller-In-Dark-Places is unaware of the countermeasure and unable to discern its disloyalty.
