> **Murrog One-Ear** is an [[Orc|orc]] [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Gorum]] who dwells in the depths of the [[Darklands]] beneath where the [[Earthnavel]] narrows down to its smallest point. Murrog tortured the secrets of appeasing the earth spirits and ancient [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] that guard the Earthnavel from a [[Kellid|Mammoth Lord]] Bloodspeaker. Now Murrog seeks a set of [[Magic|magical]] skulls that she believes will allow her to widen the depths of the Earthnavel releasing the great beasts of [[Deep Tolguth]] onto the world above.
