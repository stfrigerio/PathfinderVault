> **Jarl Yensiir Rimeblood** is the leader of the Jhodagarn clan of [[Frost giant|frost giants]], who make their home in the Ortwaar Valley near the [[Tusk Mountains]] in the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]]. The clan moved into the area in the mid-47th century AR, slaughtering the local [[Kellid human ethnicity|Kellid]] tribes and taking control of one of their holy site: the [[Mountain of Frozen Echoes]]. There, Rimeblood discovered a magical dragon skull that claimed to be an ancient god of battle. Rimeblood used the skull to construct a powerful suit of armor known as the [[Armor of Skulls]]. Unbeknownst to him, the skull is actually the largest of the [[Seven Relics of Kazavon]], the intelligent remains of the dread [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] [[Kazavon]], a servant of [[Zon-Kuthon]].
