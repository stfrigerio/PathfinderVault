> **Lictor Octavio Sabinus** leads the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Torrent]], based in [[Kintargo]]. He has not been seen since [[Barzillai Thrune|new Lord-Mayor Barzillai Thrune]] called in the [[Order of the Rack]].



## Relatives

> Octavio's cousin [[Setrona Sabinus]] runs the [[Tooth and Nail]] tavern in [[Old Kintargo]]. His mother is deceased.


## Background

> Octavio's ascension to the [[Hellknight ranks|rank of lictor]] was complicated by a longstanding feud between the Sabinus family and the family of former lictor Arcamo Hyrmagus. Only after Arcamo's death at age 77 around [[4708 AR]] did Octavio take over leadership of the Order of the Torrent.


## Possessions

> Octavio still bears his mother's [[Mithral|mithral]] [[Shortsword|shortsword]].
