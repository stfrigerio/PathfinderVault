> **Hemzel** was a [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druidic]] protector of the [[Verduran Forest]] in [[Andoran]]. There he fought the [[Pathfinder Society]] and anyone else who might steal from or desecrate his home. In a bit of dark irony, he was killed in [[4709 AR]] by [[Fey|fey]] allies of the [[Quickling|quickling]] Cyflymder, who themselves were trying to protect the forest and destroy his most prized possession: a druidic [[Artifact|artifact]] known as a *[[Lorestone|lorestone]]*.
