> **Sagitar Tiguan** is a semi-regular fixture at the [[Gold Market]] in the [[Midland|Midland district]], the largest marketplace in all [[Korvosa]]. Sagitar sells a range of trinkets and elixirs that he claims are [[Magic|magical]] and, while many have questioned their authenticity, they are certainly popular with the city's [[Adventurer|adventurers]] who always seem to turn up whenever the [[Silk|silken]] tent of Sagitar's stall appears at the Gold Market.
