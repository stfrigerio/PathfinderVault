> **Sheriff Deldrin Baleson** used to be a simple lumberjack in the service of [[Thuldrin Kreed]]. He became elected Sheriff of [[Darkmoon Vale]] just a week after he smashed [[Payden Teedum|Payden Teedums]] face with the flat side of an [[Axe|axe]] for which Teedum had tried to tax him, though Baleson had already paid for it. Nowadays, he and his deputies are the main force opposing Kreed and his thugs.
