> **Professor Alander Mangvhune** was once a beloved teacher at the [[Alabaster Academy]], but he was also the **Temple Hill Slasher**, [[Kintargo|Kintargos]] most notorious serial killer. The Slasher claimed victims from [[4596 AR]] until his arrest and execution in [[4599 AR]]. New murders have recently occurred in Kintargo that follow his same methods and patterns, and Mangvhune delights in watching others mimicking what he did.
> Mangvhune transformed into a [[Babau|babau]] [[Demon|demon]] after his death, entering into the service of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Shax]]. He currently inhabits a den on the edges of his new master's realm. This lair, named Razorspan, is a bridge-like structure composed entirely of [[Metal|metal]] blades, suspended over a deep rift filled with bones. When [[Summoned|summoned]] to the [[Material Plane]], Mangvhune typically demands a period of time after his services are completed to stalk the world to hunt and kill of his own volition, renewing the terror of the Temple Hill Slasher in cities throughout the [[Inner Sea region]].


## Background

> Alander Mangvhune was born in [[Vieland]], [[Ustalav]] and studied [[Anatomy|anatomy]] at [[Lepidstadt University]]. He came to the conclusion that he could not learn about the nature of life within a [[Human|human]] lifetime, and his research into [[Immortality|immortality]] revealed an unsettling fact: after death, his [[Soul|soul]] would be transformed into [[Outsider|something else]] without his memories. Unable to abide the loss of his individuality, the egotistical Mangvhune dedicated years to study the soul's fate after death. His research took him to the corruption of the [[River of Souls]] known as a *soul anchor*, and he moved to Kintargo in [[4592 AR]] when he discovered that one might exist somewhere beneath the city.
> During his tenure as a [[Surgeon|surgeon]] and professor of anatomy at the Alabaster Academy, Professor Mangvhune's charm and handsome looks made him a very popular figure in Kintargan society. His standing-room-only lectures drew listeners from even outside the academy, and he convincingly hid his obsession under the façade of a perfect gentleman scholar.
> Unable to locate the *soul anchor*, Mangvhune theorised that a departing soul would sense its location, and claimed his first victim in [[4596 AR]] after building a hidden [[Laboratory|laboratory]]. However, he met with nothing but frustration, as speaking with the dead only allowed communication with their physical corpses, while raising his victims as [[Undead|undead]] only forced him to put them down later since they only remembered vague memories of their brief time in death.
> In [[4598 AR]], Mangvhune had a breakthrough by repeatedly torturing someone on the brink of death and then bringing them back to life at the last moment. He felt an unmistakable tugging upon the soul after using this method on an [[Abadar|Abadaran]] priest, and located the *soul anchor* in the [[Darklands]] beneath Kintargo after a few more murders. Presently, he successfully reached the *soul anchor* and bathed in its energies, then came back to Kintargo to torture and murder people.
> The discovery that he was the infamous Slasher that had stalked the city, capturing victims off the street and torturing them for days before leaving their bodies on the slopes of [[Temple Hill]], took the city by shock. He was swiftly tried and sentenced to execution by beheading, putting a stop to the killings. However, his reputation continued to hang over Kintargo and the Alabaster Academy for years afterwards.
> Mangvhune's soul swiftly plunged into the [[Abyss]] following his death, where the taint of his murderous life quickly transformed it into a babau. Due to his contact with the *soul anchor*, he maintained the memories and personality that he had in life. Mangvhune thrived as a demon, and eventually rose to be one of the favorite servants of the babaus' master, the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Shax]].


## Possessions

> Mangvhune used the intelligent [[Magic|magical]] [[Kukri|kukri]] *[[Balgorrah kukri|Balgorrah]]* to murder many of his victims.
