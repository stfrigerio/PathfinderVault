> **Allevrah** (pronounced ah-LEV-rah) was a high-ranking general in [[Kyonin|Kyonins]] military forces, and has seen her share of battle. She sports a clipped left ear—the result of a close call in[[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|assassin]][Babau|babau]] [[Assassin|assassin]]—a wound whose scar she wears with pride as a trophy.
