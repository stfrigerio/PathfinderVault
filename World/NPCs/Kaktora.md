> A [[Kraken|kraken]] of titanic proportions, **Kaktora** ruled the seas of [[Golarion]] many centuries ago. It is said that her crushing tentacles destroyed thousands of [[Ship|ships]]. So mighty was her power that the sea [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Dagon]] could bear it no longer and in a mighty battle known as Kaktora's Last Stand, he slew the great kraken and scattered her remains across the sea. The aftermath of this battle gave rise to the [[Devilfish|devilfish]] when Dagon's blood mingled with Kaktora's remains.
