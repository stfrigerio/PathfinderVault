> A powerful [[Behir|behir]], **Lazzairhage** alone would be a fearsome opponent for many challengers. However, he is also the leader of a small tribe of [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] called the [[Wyrmslaves]]. While Lazzairhage believes himself to be completely in charge of his cowed servants, he is easily manipulated by the tribe's more cunning gnolls. They have already persuaded him to ally with the powerful gnoll leader known as the [[Carrion King]].
