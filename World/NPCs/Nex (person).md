> The archmage **Nex** (pronounced NEKS) emerged during the [[Age of Destiny]] in the city-state of [[Quantium]], which later became the capital of the [[Nex|state which bears his name]].
> Nex travelled the world and the [[Great Beyond]], and his private nation grew rich on the results of his adventures. However, in [[-892 AR]] the expansion of the country of Nex brought it into conflict with the [[Necromancer|necromancer]] [[Geb (person)|Geb]], and his nation (also called [[Geb's Rest]]). The war lasted centuries, as each wizard was able to extend his life through the use of arcane elixirs. During the war, Nex created the [[Fleshforge|fleshforges]] of [[Ecanus]].
> Nex eventually achieved true immortality by creating a personal demiplane he called the [[Crux of Nex]]. He used a shard of the Crux to create the [[Spire of Nex]] as part of an unsuccessful siege of [[Absalom]] in [[166 AR]]. He used another shard in Quantium to create the [[Refuge of Nex]], to act as a bolthole if he was threatened by his enemies.
> Nex was a longtime enemy of the extremely powerful exiled [[Fey|fey]] known as [[Count Ranalc]]. Ranalc disappeared around the time of the siege of Absalom, and the shadowy creatures Nex used during the siege may have been linked to Ranalc.
> In [[563 AR]] Nex gifted dominion over the isle of [[Jalmeray]] to the [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]] maharaja [[Khiben-Sald]].
> Some four thousand years ago, in [[576 AR]], Geb managed to bathe Quantium in a deadly fog, and Nex fled into the Refuge. He has never been seen since – and whilst thousands of other people have entered the Refuge since, none of those have ever emerged either.
