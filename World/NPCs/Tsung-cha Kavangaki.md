> **Tsung-cha Kavangaki** is the Warlord of [[Kaoling]], figurehead leader of the ruling Council of Nine who rules the nation.


## Associates

> Kavangaki enjoys the unwavering support of most members of the Council of Nine except [[Himoko Na-ichi]], whom he has tried to stymie. Na-ichi's strength rivals that of Kavangaki, to the point that he cannot just cause her to disappear. Their conflict risks sending the entire nation of Kaoling into chaos.
> Kavangaki resides in the palace of Dhucharg-jo in the capital city of [[Dhucharg]], attended by [[Slavery|slaves]] that ensure his obscene luxury. The Crimson Sentinels are a personal, largely ceremonial guard consisting of soldiers who demonstrated their courage and ferocity in combat. In recent years, he has also leveraged the [[Dragon's Teeth|Dragons Teeth]], Kaoling's secret police who lie outside of the Council of Nine's control, to silence his personal enemies. However, rumour has it that the Dragon's Teeth's leader Jenji Tukozami is secretly Himoko Na-ichi's ally.
> Kavangaki claims to the the greatest supporter of the Palace of the Black Daimyo, Dhucharg's temple to [[General Susumu]].


## Background

> Kavangaki is a veteran of Kaoling's most recent and nearly successful invasion of [[Zi Ha]]. His forces, led by a subordinate, [[Ping-la Maningki]], prepare in [[Fort Kragang]] for an eventual continuance of their invasion of Zi Ha. For now though, they content themselves with raiding. Kavangaki built a coalition to oust his predecessor and has ever since controlled the majority of the Council of Nine.
