> The infiltration of [[Osirion]] and then the ultimate overthrow of **Pharaoh Menedes XXVI**—later called the **Fallen Pharaoh**—in [[1532 AR]] by an invading [[Qadira|Qadiran]] army was the end of [[Osirion|Osirian]] independence for over 3,000 years. This nadir was the culmination of years of neglect by [[Pharaoh|pharaoh]] after pharaoh, and independence was not regained until the ascension of [[Khemet I]] in [[4609 AR]].
