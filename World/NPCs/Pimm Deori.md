> **Pimm Deori** is the first recorded [[Avistan|Avistani]] to be born on [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] soil, 13 days after his parents arrived in [[Segada]] from [[Cheliax]], as well as the first Avistani to gain Segadan citizenship. He has lived in Segada for all his life, working to improve relations between colonists and the native [[Mahwek human ethnicity|Mahweks]]. Disenchanted by Cheliax's imperialism, he seeks to learn what he can about Arcadia, and is seen as a traitor by many Chelish settlers in [[Anchor's End|Anchors End]], who blame his half-Arcadian wife Sokanon, even though she is a greater advocate of colonialism.
