> **Inkit Reli** was a [[Kellid]] woman captured in an [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] raid into the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] and enslaved in [[Whitethrone]]. [[Velikas|Queen Velikas]] was desperately concerned with the spread of the [[Chillbane fever]] epidemic from the [[Vault of Silver and Ice]], which had already devastated the city of [[Algidheart]]. Nothing the queen's advisers or Irriseni clerics did managed to treat the disease, and it appeared that Irrisen would soon be a nation of corpses. Inkit presented herself to the Queen, saying she was a priestess of [[Desna]] and could stop the epidemic if Queen Velikas would stop raiding the lands over the [[Gullik River]]. The Queen agreed and Inkit managed to stop the contagion within a month. The Queen kept her promise but brutalized Inkit and buried her alive in the Vault which was then sealed with strong magic. Inkit's restless spirit is said to haunt the Vault.
