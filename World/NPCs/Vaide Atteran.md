> The charming and well-spoken **Vaide Atteran** is the patriarch of the influential [[Atteran family]], and lives in a region of northern [[Nidal]] known as the [[Atteran Ranches]]. It is unknown whether the region is named after the family or vice versa. By tightly controlling and policing the Ranches themselves, the ranchers (under the leadership of Vaide) have been largely successful in maintaining the region's independence from the [[Umbral Court]] in the capital of [[Pangolais]]. This autonomy has had the additional benefit for Vaide of keeping all of the most lucrative [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]] trading contracts within the Atteran family.
