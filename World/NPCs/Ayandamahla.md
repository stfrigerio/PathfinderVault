> **Ayandamahla** is a [[Succubus|succubus]] who served as the castellan of the [[Lady's Light|Ladys Light]] during the time of [[Thassilon]].


## Background

> Ayandamahla was first [[Magic/Conjuration|conjured]] by [[Sorshen]] just before the [[Runelords|runelords]] gathered to discuss the removal of [[Xin|Emperor Xin]]; Sorshen was expecting to be betrayed and promised Ayandamahla a week of freedom in [[Eurythnia]] if she were to aid her against such betrayals. The only person being betrayed that night was Xin, however, but Sorshen kept her promise. Ayandamahla was made the steward of the Lady's Light, and for the rest of the [[Age of Legend]] she served Sorshen in numerous other capacities, guarded the *[[Shard of Lust]]*, and aided her research in the relationship between [[Immortality|immortality]] and blood.
> Sorshen learnt about the upcoming [[Earthfall]] and end of Thassilon and, before retreating into the Eye of Desire, she [[Binding outsiders|bound]] Ayandamahla into the Lady's Light, preventing the succubus from leaving until she returned. Furious at both Sorshen and herself for being tricked, Ayandamahla [[Magic|magically]] protected the Lady's Light as Earthfall devastated Thassilon; she grew increasingly frustrated at what she considered to be imprisonment on a dying [[Golarion]]. When she eventually discovered a fault in Sorshen's magic that allowed one of her blood relatives to take her place, Ayandamahla duped her [[Alu-demon|alu-demon]] daughter [[Ashamintallu]] into doing so, allowing Ayandamahla to return to the [[Abyss]].
> Since then, while improving her skills and serving her mistress [[Zura]], Ayandamahla has watched [[Varisia]] for the return of Sorshen so she could take revenge.
