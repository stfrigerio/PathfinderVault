> **Father Echume Hepripe** is a paranoid and aggressive priest of [[Nethys]] in the [[Gozarin Necropolis]] in southern [[Osirion]]. He is the current leader of the [[Jah-Ipo]] priesthood, a small group of [[Cleric|clerics]] that maintains the grave sites of [[Gebessek IX]] and the aboveground levels of the [[Pyramid of Masks]]. In [[4707 AR]], with [[Khemet III]]'s opening of Osirion's tombs to explorers, the Jah-Ipo lost their right to arrest and try grave-robbers. Father Echume Hepripe often orders Jah-Ipo guardians to spy on visitors to tombs no longer under his jurisdiction.
