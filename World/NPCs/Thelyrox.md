> **Thelyrox**, the ancient [[White dragon|white dragon]] known as the **Great White Wyrm**, is said to dwell on [[Mount Kaltafarr]], an ancient extinct [[Volcano|volcano]] in the [[Southern Range]] of [[Taldor|Taldors]] [[World's Edge Mountains|Worlds Edge Mountains]]. He is still greatly feared, despite the fact that the wyrm has not been spotted in over a century.


## History

> The Great White Wyrm once ruled the [[Headwater Gap]], the break in the World's Edge Mountains south of the Southern Range, through fear and terror. When [[Qadira]] ruled this area, they sent numerous [[Dragon|dragon]] slayers to deal with the menace, but none was ever heard from again. The final group sent were the Shining Blades of Katheer, who claimed to be in possession of a [[Magic|magical]] [[Artifact|artifact]] capable of dealing with the white dragon. Even though they disappeared during their mission, the wyrm ceased his attacks, and has not been heard from since.
