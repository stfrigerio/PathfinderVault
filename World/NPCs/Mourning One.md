> The **Mourning One** is a leviathan of a [[Sea serpent|sea serpent]] who dwells within the frigid waters of [[Sekamina|Sekaminas]] [[Lake Nirthran]]. Created in the lightless [[Orv|Orvian]] vault known as the [[Land of Black Blood]], the Mourning One has only recently escaped its prison. The [[Ghoul|ghoul]] [[Necromancer|necromancers]] of [[Nemret Noktoria]] and the [[Drow|drow]] [[Fleshwarper|fleshwarpers]] of [[Delvingulf]] both seek to capture the serpent for the valuable [[Black blood|black blood]] that flows through its veins, while the [[Skum|skum]] of [[Cold Momugado]] want it dead due to the threat it poses to their scavenging and raiding parties. So far, however, the Mourning One has avoided capture or killing by all these factions.
