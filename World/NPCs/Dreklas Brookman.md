> **Dreklas Brookman** was a resident of the small town of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] in [[Andoran]]. He dug the so named [[Brookman's Well|Brookmans Well]] just north of the town. Brookman had big plans for the town and was gaining support of the other residents when he crossed old [[Thalsin Kreed]]. Brookman ended up having an "accident" and the [[Kreed family]] immediately took control of the well, which supplies most of the town's fresh water.
