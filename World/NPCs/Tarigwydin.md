> **Tarigwydin** is the ruler of [[Taste of Anguish]], a trading town in the [[Abyss]], located on a branch of the [[River Styx]]. He keeps the settlement calm enough to attract [[Plane|planar travelers]] who come there to exchange goods. Tarigwydin lives in the bows of an enormous demonic tree that grows in the center of town, and is said to contain an unusual source of power within it. The [[Vrock|vrock]] is particularly interested in acquiring finely made tools forged by [[Axiomite|axiomites]], as he loves to destroy them.
