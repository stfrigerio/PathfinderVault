> **Black Heron** was the most famous of the [[Ten Magic Warriors]] trained by [[Jatembe]]. In [[-2556 AR]], Black Heron, or one of his followers wearing his mask, called a tribal council of the [[Shory]], encouraging the Shory tribes to unite against the destructive cults of [[Rovagug]] rampaging through southern [[Garund]]. Black Heron shared Jatembe's magical traditions with the Shory who applied the power of [[Aeromancy|aeromancy]] and elemental magic to defeat these demented cults.
