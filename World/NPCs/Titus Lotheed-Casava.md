> **Lord Titus Lotheed-Casava** is a cousin by marriage of the famed [[Arcane magic|arcanists]] of House Lotheed but has none of their [[Magic|magical]] aptitude; instead, he is merely a vicious and violent bully. Titus currently resides at House Lotheed's seat, the [[Palace of Birdsong]], near [[Lotheedar]] in [[Taldor]], leeching off the fortune of [[Bartelby Lotheed|Count Bartelby Lotheed]]. Titus is not only a bully but also a braggart and a slacker, and he has developed a reputation as somewhat of a parasite around [[Meratt|Meratt County]]. He was formally an aide within the [[Senate|Taldan Senate]] before being booted from his family home in [[Oppara]]. The only reason Bartelby keeps Titus around is that, while in Oppara, Titus gained something of a reputation as duelist that he now uses to bully and intimidate enemies of the Lotheeds. Somewhat of a drunk, Titus is rarely without his own pair of hangers-on: Dame Carodd Hellebore and Syras Cockleburr Esq., both of whom view Titus as their meal ticket.
