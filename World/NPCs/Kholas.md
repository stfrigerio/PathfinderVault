> The [[Vampire|vampire]] [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]] **Kholas** is a member of [[Nidal|Nidals]] ruling council, the [[Umbral Court]], but is currently assigned to be the ambassador of his country to the court of [[Abrogail Thrune II|Queen Abrogail Thrune II]] of [[Cheliax]]. He is the leader of the pro-Cheliax faction in the Umbral Court, and views the alliance between the two countries as a hard-won opportunity to expand the influence of [[Zon-Kuthon]] across [[Golarion]].


## Appearance

> Kholas is an urbane, sophisticated man, both unsettling and faultlessly polite at the same time. He wears [[Silver|silver]]-fastened dark robes, in homage to his past as a [[Shadowcaller|shadowcaller]] of [[Dusk Hall]].


## Associates

> Kholas is vaguely suspicious that [[Eloiander of Ridwan]], his hard-line xenophobic rival who leads the isolationist faction in the Umbral Court, might be plotting against Cheliax. He is eager to verify these suspicions and use concrete proof of such actions to strike down Eloiander.
