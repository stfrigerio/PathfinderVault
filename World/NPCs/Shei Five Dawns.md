> Little is known of the oracle **Shei Five Dawns**, an [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] from the distant [[Vudra|Vudran]] subcontinent.  Believed to be lost or deceased, her followers have been searching for her for many years. Few know that she was defeated by the [[Adhukait|adhukait]] [[Asura|asura]] [[Kaisadvaisad]], who keeps her still-living head locked away in the bottom-most catacombs of the [[Tomb of the Thousand Tusks]].
