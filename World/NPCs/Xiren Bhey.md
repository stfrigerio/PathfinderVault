> [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]] **Captain Xiren Bhey** is the current leader of [[Okeno Slavers]]. He arrived in [[Okeno]] more than ten years ago and gained the reputation of a ruthless slaver. In [[4704 AR]], Captain Xiren Bhey killed the leader of Okeno Slavers in a duel and established himself as the new leader. He captains the [[Ship|galley]] *[[Undertow]]*. He proved himself a skilled diplomat on land as he is a cut-throat on the water. Captain Bhey managed to increase cooperation between the slavers uniting ships and captains he feels work well together. These small fleets, encompassing two to six ships, have orders to target [[Andoren privateers]] and look for charts or written orders, revealing privateer's strategies.
