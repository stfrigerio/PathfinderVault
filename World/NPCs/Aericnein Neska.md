> A sophisticated, charming tyrant who is as willing to discuss the arts as he is to mercilessly crush his subjugated citizens, it is surprising then that **Count Aericnein Neska** is so well liked by the nobility. While he may rule with an iron fist, life in his home county of [[Barstoi]] is not all bad. Loyal service, hard work and ingenuity are all rewarded, while laziness and weakness are mercilessly stamped out. Aericnein is also hungry for conquest: he was responsible for the escalation of tensions with neighbouring [[Ardeal]] and [[Varno]] that lead to all-out civil war, known as the [[War Without Rivals]], in [[4687 AR]], and the eventual creation of the wasteland known as [[The Furrows|the Furrows]] in [[4693 AR]]. Despite this, he is still a popular noble in [[Ustalav]] and many would like to see him on the country's throne instead of [[Aduard Ordranti III|Prince Aduard]], believing that Aericnein could lead the country to a new golden age of conquest and power.
> His secretary is the [[Hellknight (Book)|hellknight]] [[Eilisilo Varga]].
