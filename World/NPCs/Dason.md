> **Dason** was the legendary first [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Antipaladin|antipaladin]] of the [[Deity|goddess]] of [[Undead|undeath]], [[Urgathoa]]. He created her holy book known as *[[Serving Your Hunger]]*, an extended meditation on what it means to put your personal gratification and sensation before all else. Dason was rewarded for completing the book by being given the vile *[[Defiled Disks of Urgathoa]]*.
