> **Lictor Jaisade** commanded the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Scourge]] around the time of the ascension of [[House Thrune]] to the throne of [[Cheliax]].  In [[4640 AR]], he was asked by the recently installed [[Abrogail Thrune I|Queen Abrogail Thrune I]] to move his order to [[Egorian]] and become her personal guard and police force.  Knowing that House Thrune was in the Order's debt for many years of service during the [[Chelish Civil War]], Lictor Jaisade declined, stating that he would continue enforcing the new laws and ideals of Cheliax, but would not compromise his ideals and beliefs.
