> **Harthwik Barzoni, Grand Admiral of the Fever Sea** is the official ruler of the city of [[Bloodcove]]. The Grand Admiral of Bloodcove is supposedly elected for life by the scions of the original pirate founders. In truth, the [[Aspis Consortium]] and other trading consortiums that use Bloodcove to move their goods, choose the Grand Admiral and define what power the position holds. Harthwik Barzoni maintains the militia and ensures the undisrupted flow of trade, receiving monthly fees for his efforts.
