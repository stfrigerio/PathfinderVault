 Kyra learning the ropes...
 
 ...Kyra having gained significant power
> Born in a small [[Qadira|Qadiran]] farming town to loving parents, Kyra (pronounced Ky-rah) grew up in the shadow of one of [[Sarenrae|Sarenraes]] shrines. She was taken at a young age with the beauty of the shrine's stained glass, and the grace of the three priestesses who practiced swordplay on the nearby hill each dawn as they offered their morning prayers. When bandits attacked her small town, Kyra watched as the priestesses did their best to reason with them—and when that came to naught, to end them before they could do more damage. Unfortunately, the bandits were too strong, and the village burned. Kyra was one of the few survivors, and on the smoking ruins of the shrine she swore her life and sword arm to Sarenrae, swore to protect those who could not protect themselves, and to not spare the blade when the time for redemption passes.
> Possessed of a fierce will and pride in her faith and skills with the scimitar, Kyra has traveled far since her trial by fire. She lost her family and home that fateful day, yet where another might be consumed by anger and a thirst for revenge, Kyra has found peace in the Everlight, and in the belief that, if she can prevent even one death at evil hands, her own losses will not have been in vain.


> Kyra tells her own story in the comic [[Pathfinder Origins 2]].
