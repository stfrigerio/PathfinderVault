> As of [[4713 AR]], **Anastasia Nikolaevna** is the fifteenth and current queen of [[Irrisen]] and the first non-[[Winter witch|winter witch]] to have held this office. She has adapted well to her new role as Irrisen's leader, despite hailing from a [[Planet|planet]] where [[Magic|magic]] is almost non-existent.



## Relatives

> Anastasia is the secret daughter of Tsarina Alexandra and [[Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin]], and through her father, the granddaughter of [[Baba Yaga]]. Only her father knows the truth of Anastasia's parentage; historians of [[Earth]] record her as the legitimate daughter of Tsar Nicholas II of [[Russia]], Alexandra's husband, and Anastasia herself only knew Rasputin as a 'holy friend'. As a member of the Russian royal family, she is also known as **Anastasia Romanova**, **Anastasia Romanov**, or more fully as **Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanova**.


## Background

> In the Earth year [[4713 AR|AD 1918]], after Anastasia and her family were executed by Russia's new [[Communism|Bolshevik]] government, Rasputin resurrected her from a lock of her hair to serve as a fail-safe in case he or his sister [[Elvanna]] failed in their plan to usurp their mother. He put Anastasia in a monastery within the Akuvskaya prison camp, from which she was later rescued by a band of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] from [[Golarion]] who sought to thwart Elvanna and Rasputin's plan.
> After these adventurers were successful, Baba Yaga accepted their request to crown Anastasia as Irrisen's new queen. The life of the common people of Irrisen knew a marked improvement in her first years of rule, yet many winter witches are resentful and regard her as the "Fraud Queen".
