> **Nazhena Vasilliovna** is a great-great-granddaughter of [[Elvanna]], Queen of [[Irrisen]] and currently the ruler of the village of [[Waldsby]] in the Irriseni province of [[Hoarwood province|Hoarwood]]. She gained the best physical characteristics from both her [[Jadwiga]] and [[Ulfen]] bloodlines, which makes her tall, with blue eyes, platinum blond hair, and a perfect complexion.
> Nazhena was born at the Pale Tower, but was educated in the royal palace in [[Whitethrone]] before returning to the Pale Tower to overthrow her mother. [[Radosek Pavril]] is both her apprentice and lover, despite commonly referring to him as her "flawed [[Taldan]] apprentice".
