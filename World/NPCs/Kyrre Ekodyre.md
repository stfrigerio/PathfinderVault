## Background

> Paralictor Kyrre Ekodyre is a high ranking member of Order of the Rack who fully expected to be promoted to lictor of the order once [[Richemar Alamansor]] stepped down. In the end, this did not happen as [[Darcyne Wrens]] was appointed as the order's new lictor instead. Kyrre was appointed to lead a contingent of Order of the Rack Hellknights to Kintargo to support the new [[House Thrune|Thrune]]-appointed Lord-Mayor [[Barzillai Thrune]]. Kyrre viewed this appointment as another step on her path towards power and saw it as a good duty to perform whilst waiting for [[Cheliax|Cheliaxs]] problems with the [[Glorious Reclamation]] to be resolved. While Kyrre is loyal to Barzillai, the way he treated her fellow Hellknights of the [[Order of the Torrent]] has left her disturbed. Kyrre Ekodyre and her fellow Hellknights are using [[Castle Kintargo]] as their base of operations, keeping watch over [[Kintargo Keep]]. As well as Hellknight.s Kyrre was also granted a contingent of [[Phantom armor|phantom armors]] to assist her and, unbeknownst to her, in the depths of Kintargo Keep the long forgotten [[First Warden]] also stands guard.
