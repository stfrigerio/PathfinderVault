> **Varnal Knocmar** is [[Riddleport|Riddleports]] master of beggars, but goes to great lengths to disguise the cleft palate that gave him the nickname of **Split Face**. He organizes various street gangs, pickpockets, and small-time cons. His business sometimes steps on the toes of [[Shorafa Pamodae]], and he sells some information to those seeking answers. Knocmar has many bases in both the [[Wharf District]] and the [[Rotgut District]].
