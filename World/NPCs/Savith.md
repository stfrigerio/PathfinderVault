> **Savith** was the great [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] heroine who defeated the [[Deity|god]] of the [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]], [[Ydersius]], in the mythic time known as the [[Age of Legend]].


## History

> After leading an army into the jungles of [[Garund]], she attacked the serpentfolk in the subterranean city of [[Ilmurea]] around [[-6280 AR]]. Being a mere [[Mortal|mortal]], she could not kill the god outright but instead decapitated the god and cast the head into a lake of fire and banished the body to the [[Darklands]]. Savith was [[Poison|poisoned]] in her epic battle and died shortly thereafter.
> Cults of Ydersius sacrifice victims made to look like Savith on the god's 'holiday' on the 29th [[Rova]], called the Day of Sundering.
