> The [[Cheliax|Chelish]] port city of [[Hinji]] is ruled by **Lord-Mayor Tareth Ivici**, who earned the title by eliminating or exiling the rest of his dishonored noble family and petitioning [[Abrogail Thrune II|Queen Abrogail II]]. Lord-Mayor Ivici claims the Queen granted him the [[Devil|devil]] Ivirno as an advisor, a claim some in town believe is a ruse borne of a disguised [[Tiefling|tiefling]].
