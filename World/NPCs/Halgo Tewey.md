> **Halgo Tewey** is the owner of the famous [[Steel-Clad Giant]] smithy in the town of [[Rapier Bay]] on the [[Motaku Isle]] in the [[Shackles]]. Supported by his five children, Halgo makes some of the finest [[Sword|swords]] west of the [[Arch of Aroden]]. It is said that the wait list for a masterwork blade is now eight months. Halgo has vowed never to leave Rapier Bay, as his beloved wife [[Marlu Tewey|Marlu]], is buried in the town.
