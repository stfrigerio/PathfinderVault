**Personality**: Morwen Thistle is a tormented soul, reflecting her difficult and tragic past. She is irate and filled with resentment, with a sharp tongue and quick temper. Her spectral form mirrors her inner turmoil, often appearing more agitated and flickering more intensely when she is particularly upset or angry.

**Backstory**: Morwen was a promising student at Promise Academy, known for her intelligence and magical talent. Her life took a tragic turn, however, when she became the victim of harassment and manipulation at the hands of one of the academy's most influential professors. When she tried to speak out about the abuse, the academy, in an attempt to protect its reputation and the status of the professor, dismissed her claims and turned a blind eye to her suffering.

Isolated and shamed, Morwen felt increasingly hopeless, eventually leading her to take her own life. The academy, continuing to prioritize its image, covered up the circumstances surrounding her death, leaving her spirit restless and filled with fury.

**Request to the players**: Morwen seeks justice and exposure of the truth. She wants the players to reveal the professor's abusive behavior and the academy's complicity in covering up her ordeal. Her hope is that, by bringing these dark truths to light, she can prevent others from enduring the same pain and finally find peace in death.
