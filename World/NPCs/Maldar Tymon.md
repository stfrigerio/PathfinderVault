> **Maldar Tymon** was a famous [[Taldor|Taldan]] gladiator who is best remembered for having founded the [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Tymon]] in [[2021 AR]].


## Background

> Maldar was a well-known gladiator during the early 21st century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]] in his hometown of [[Oppara]], where he competed at the [[Oppara Arena]]. Feeling that he needed a greater challenge, Maldar assembled a group of his fellow gladiators and joined the [[Fifth Army of Exploration]], helping to conquer the area today known as the [[River Kingdoms]]. In return for his service, he was given a large stretch of land that included much of the [[Exalted Wood]] and a mandate to rule that land in the name of [[Taldor]]. Maldar and his companions accepted this challenge and founded the town of [[Tymon]] and began taming the local wilderness.
