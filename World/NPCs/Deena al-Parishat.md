> **Deena al-Gharla Antim Zhar al-Parishat** is a [[Kelesh|Keleshite]] noblewoman. She is the shahiyan (consort) to [[Xerbystes II]], [[Satrap]] of [[Qadira]].


## Biography

> Al-Parishat is originally from Isfahel, the capital of [[Kelesh]], and is distantly related to the imperial family: her cousin Layilah is a possible candidate to succeed [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Kalish XXII]]. Xerbystes arranged to marry her sometime between [[4709 AR|4709]] and [[4720 AR]] after his liege threatened him with removal from office if he did not soon take a bride.


## Interests

> Al-Parishat is an accomplished equestrian and was pleased to share that interest with her new husband. She routinely goes for horseback rides through [[Katheer]] in the early hours of the morning.
> Al-Parishat is outspokenly in favor of the abolition of [[Slavery|slavery]] in Qadira and has secretly been working to establish contact with the [[Bellflower Network]] to help undermine the trade, particularly in [[Sedeq]].
