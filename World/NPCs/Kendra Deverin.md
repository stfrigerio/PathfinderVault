> **Kendra Deverin** has served as [[Sandpoint|Sandpoints]] mayor since [[4702 AR]], after defeating her rival [[Titus Scarnetti]] by a landslide. Lawmaker, judge, and general peacemaker, she has proven to be both an adept diplomat and stern hand when need be, both skills honed during her youth in [[Magnimar]]. With a personal—some say sisterly—style of governing, most of Sandpoint's citizens hold deep respect for their fiery-haired mayor.


## Relatives

> Kendra is the daughter of Amos Deverin, Sandpoint's first mayor, and sister of Fenchus Deverin, who succeeded their father. After Fenchus died, she inherited both the family fortune and his position as mayor. Kendra lives in [[Deverin Manor]] with another brother, Aiver, his wife Vana, and their five sons.
> Kendra's uncle is [[Hobart Deverin|Lord Hobart Deverin]], the head of her family in [[Magnimar]], and her cousin is [[Keleri Deverin]], an aristocrat and scholar also in Magnimar.


## Associates

> Kendra was in a relationship with Sandpoint's late sheriff [[Casp Avertin]], who nominated her for the position of mayor after Fenchus died. However, Casp's death at the hands of the murderer [[Jervis Stoot|Chopper]] cut short their plans of marriage, and since then, Kendra has given up on romance to focus on politics.
