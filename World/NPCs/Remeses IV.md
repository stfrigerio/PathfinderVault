> Remeses IV was pharaoh of [[Osirion]] several hundred years ago. 
> During his reign the cult of [[Rovagug]] re-established a temple within the [[Pyramid of Kamaria]]. Remeses IV initially dealt harshly with the cult, but then decided it was better to allow them to establish themselves within the pyramid rather than have them organise elsewhere in secret. This policy has been followed by subsequent pharaohs.
