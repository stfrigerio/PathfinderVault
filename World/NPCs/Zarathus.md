> **Zarathus al-Samiya Ursani Hakkal** is the most prominent officer in the [[Qadira|Qadiran]] military. He is the general of the northern reaches and commander of the military city of [[Omash]]. The general longs for war with [[Taldor]] and repeatedly asks [[Xerbystes II|Satrap Xerbystes II]] for permission to venture further into Taldan territory. While Xerbystes always denies such requests, both want war and separately consider false-flag operations that will leave the [[Stavian III|emperor]] with no choice other than to declare war. From time to time, Zarathus has to send patrols to the foothills to fight the [[Ogre|ogre]] raiding parties nestled in the mountains, but he also sends emissaries to them to control their bloodlust; only half of them return.
