> **Lord Drellis Artume** was an [[Andoran]] nobleman who fled into the [[River Kingdoms]] after his homeland's successful [[People's Revolt|Peoples Revolt]]. He began the construction of a large keep on the banks of the [[Sellen River]] and gathered his followers and family there. He soon began to organize the local farmers and shepherds for the common defense, eventually declaring himself the king of the newly formed nation of [[Artume]]. After a series of disagreements with the [[Outlaw Council]] of the nearby, and much larger city of [[Daggermark]], he was assassinated in [[4690 AR]].
> His pregnant wife, the [[Sovella Artume|Lady Sovella Artume]], foolishly handed rule to the crusading [[Paladin|paladin]] [[Bransen Waike|Sir Bransen Waike]], who forsook his oath to fight the [[Demon|demons]] of the [[Worldwound]]. Previously the advisor to Lord Drellis, Sir Waike took the position of regent and attempted to assassinate Lady Sovella, who managed to flee to the [[Everbloom]] monastery.
