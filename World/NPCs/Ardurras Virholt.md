> **King Ardurras Virholt**, called the Last King of [[Ustalav]], was the last of the [[Virholt family|Virholt]] line of Ustalavic kings and the last king to resist [[Tar-Baphon|the Whispering Tyrant]] before the lich lord's centuries-long reign. Ardurras fell in combat against the Whispering Tyrant's hordes during the [[Battle of Dawnmarsh]] in [[3206 AR]]. Subsequently, Tar-Baphon raised Ardurras as an undead travesty called the Shrieking Sovereign. The Shrieking Sovereign marched ahead of the Whispering Tyrant's legions, leading them into the heart of [[Ardis]] and finally hanging itself from the [[Palace Tower]].
