>  **Sicnavier** is a powerful [[Umbral dragon]] who dwells in the [[Hungry Mountains]] of [[Virlych]]. The [[Dragon]] has tormented the people of western [[Ustalav]] for countless centuries.
>  Known to few people is the fact that the name Sicnavier is the title not of one, but six different umbral dragons throughout the centuries. Although [[heroes]] have been known to rise up in the past to slay the menace, a younger dragon has always stepped up to take the mantle and claim the vast draconic hoard of [[Sicnavier's Lair]] for itself.
>  The most recent claimant of the title is a very old umbral dragon who took the mantle after defeating his mother in combat. For over a century since that day, he has terrorized the region and wallowed in the wealth and power of Sicnavier's Lair.
>  Rumours hold that Sicnavier is half-mad, driven to near [[insanity]] from the haunting whispers of his own dead kin.
>  Sicnavier has a son named Chunvexus. He knows of his father's claim to fame, and waits for him to show weakness so he could claim the name Sicnavier for himself.
