> **Agrellus Kisk** is the leader of the [[Arclords of Nex]], who dominate [[Nex|Nexs]] ruling [[Council of Three and Nine]]. While he is also the most recent member of the Three, he has held his influential position for more than 100 years, in part because the other Arclords are distracted by their own squabbles.


## Journal

> Agrellus Kisk keeps a journal in which he discusses, amongst other things, the history of his nation.
