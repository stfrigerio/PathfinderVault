> **Brodert Quink** is the resident sage of the town of [[Sandpoint]]. Though his intelligence and education are undeniable, many of his theories are regarded as little more than fantasy by his peers and the community.



## Appearance

> Quink is a aged man, likely losing his hair to stress as much as to the passage of years.


## Personality

> Constantly frustrated by the lack of respect he feels he is entitled to as a result of his knowledge and expertise, Quink is quick to anger and difficult to interact with.


## Skills & Abilities

> Quink's belief that he is superior to those around him is not entirely unfounded; he is an exceptionally knowledgeable individual and a specialist in the fields of engineering and [[Varisia|Varisian]] history. He finds the study of ancient [[Thassilon]] to be particularly intriguing, and it was his research into Sandpoint's [[Old Light]] that originally brought him to the area.


## Friends & Foes

> Brodert Quink considers himself an intellectual and can often be found at *[[The Curious Goblin]]*, where he has been known to engage the shop's owner, [[Chask Haladan]], and its other patrons in discussion.
