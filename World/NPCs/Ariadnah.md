> **Ariadnah, the Briarstone Witch**, is a legendary [[Witch|witch]] born in [[Ustalav]]. She is a descendant of the [[Kellid]] Lacksong clan, which inhabited the shores of [[Lake Encarthan]] before being driven away from their ancestral home during the founding of the nation of Ustalav.


## Background

> Bitter over her peoples' fate, Ariadnah sought to find a way to avenge herself on Ustalav's population. Her prayers to her [[God|goddess]], [[Shub-Niggurath]], eventually led her to the *[[Star Stela|Star Stelae]]*, enchanted [[Artifact|artifacts]] originally erected by the [[Flying polyp|flying polyps]] in the distant past that had the potential to open a connection to alien realms and their inhabitants.
> Ariadnah resolved to use the stelae, which were located in the coastal town of [[Thrushmoor]], to call an aspect of Shub-Niggurath into the world to spread misery and destruction. She insinuated herself into the local population, driving Thrushmoor's citizens towards more and more [[Evil|evil]] acts, and successfully contacted and bound an entity known as the [[Tatterman]]. Ariadnah completed her [[Ritual|rituals]] as the corrupted citizenry rose in rebellion against the government and the church of [[Pharasma]], but a malfunction in the stelae interfered with her [[Magic|magic]]. Instead of [[Summoning|summoning]] an alien entity into the world, Ariadnah was herself transported to the parasite city of [[Carcosa]], where she was left stranded.
> This mistake did not halt Ariadnah's dreams of vengeance. She has endured in Carcosa for 600 years, even as memory of her faded to myth on [[Golarion]], transforming herself into a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] (although she still maintains the outwards appearance of a [[Mortal|mortal]], if aged, woman). She plans to fully activate the *Star Stelae* to bring the [[Great Old One]] [[Xhamen-Dor]] to Thrushmoor, allowing her to both return to her home world and to feed the town to Carcosa, allowing her to finally fulfill her desire for revenge against the people who wronged her ancestors long ago.
