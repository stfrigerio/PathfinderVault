> **King Ethered** was the penultimate ruler of the eastern [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Raemerrund]]. He passed in [[3298 AR]], leaving his lands to his son [[Jarguut]], a man unsuited in temperament to rule. So great was the love his [[Thane|thanes]] bore for Ethered, however, that they accepted Jarguut as their king, even though he had not slain a [[Linnorm|linnorm]].
