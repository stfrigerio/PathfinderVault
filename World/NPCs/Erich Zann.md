> **Erich Zann** is a mute [[Bard's End|bard]] native to the distant [[Planet|planet]] [[Earth]] who leads the [[Leng ghoul|Leng ghouls]] in the Paris nexus of [[Carcosa]].


## History

> During his time on Earth, Erich Zann lived in the Rue d'Auseil in the city of Paris, worked for a local orchestra and tapped into a form of [[Primal magic|primal magic]].
> During a failed performance of *The King in Yellow* in Paris, Erich protected himself with his new masterpiece, the Fugue de Rue d'Auseil. Its [[Magic|magic]] mixed with *The King in Yellow*, excising the Rue d'Auseil from Earth's temporal continuity and transporting it to Carcosa. At Carcosa, his knowledge appealed to the local civilised Leng ghouls, who keep their [[Evil|evil]] nature in check and accepted him as the leader of the new Paris nexus. He has gained a reputation of circumventing many of Carcosa's worst degradations with his masterpieces.
