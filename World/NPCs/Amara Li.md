> Among the newest [[Venture-captain|venture-captains]] of the [[Pathfinder Society]], Amara Li originates from the bustling city of [[Goka]]. Respected for her gracefulness, poise, and cleanliness, Amara Li is also known for her perfectly executed [[Tea|tea]] ceremonies. 
> Rumours circulate of personal financial problems that trouble Amara, although she considers discussing such matters to be "improper" and refuses to discuss them. Gossip also suggests that her money problems have prompted her decision to increase cooperation between the [[Inner Sea region]] and [[Tian Xia]].
> She migrated to [[Absalom]] in [[4711 AR]] to run the [[Lantern Lodge faction|Lantern Lodge]] in the [[Petal District]], where she advised and dispatched Pathfinders to [[Tian Xia]]. She spent much of her time in her meticulously tended garden on the property.
> With the dissolution of the Absalom Lantern Lodge in [[4713 AR]], Amara returned to Goka to operate its expanded [[Lantern Lodge]].
