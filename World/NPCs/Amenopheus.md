> **Amenopheus** is a member of the elite [[Jeweled Sages]] of [[Osirion]], some of the world's most adept spymasters.  Though the Jeweled Sages were disbanded when the [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]] invaders took over their desert empire centuries ago, Amenopheus claims to trace his blood to the line of the [[Astrology|astrologers]] of antiquity—a claim bolstered by the re-emergence of the Diamond Sage [[Tahonikepsu]].
> A former associate of the [[Pathfinder Society]], Amenopheus has since retired to [[Sothis]] and serves as a consultant to the government.


## Appearance

> Amenopheus is a typical Osirian, in that his appearance and demeanor seem to overflow with mystery and inspire awe in those who meet him. His aged features rest over a long black beard which he wears in a single braid adorned with copper bands. His attire is generally austere red robes (the sleeves of which are well-known to contain a number of powerful wands) and basic sandals of fine leather.


## Background

> The **Sapphire Sage** served as the adviser to Drendhet Salhar, an obese Osirian noble who sits on the [[Government of AbsalomGrand Council|Grand Council of Absalom]]. The truth is that Salhar was but one of many pawns in Amenopheus's hand. Many claim that Amenopheus was a member of the [[Pathfinder Society]] in his youth before returning to his homeland when the [[Khemet III|Ruby Prince]] took the throne and restored the ancient Jeweled Sages to their former place at their ruler's side. 
> Assigned to [[Absalom]] by the Prince to oversee the shadow war for control of the metropolis, Amenopheus ran an intricate and secretive web of agents who work to outwit their rivals. Some rumors are more extreme than a youth of adventuring, however, and some claim to have seen ancient Osirian tapestries depicting a man advising the pharaohs who resembles Amenopheus too closely to not be the same man. These whispers naturally lead to assumptions that he is in fact the original Sapphire Sage brought from his uncovered tomb to once again serve his nation.
> Although not a member of the [[Pathfinder Society]], Amenopheus recognized the threat posed by the rogue [[Shadow Lodge faction|Shadow Lodge]] cells as a threat to his faction. In response, he posed as a traitor in order to infiltrate the treacherous elements and bring the subversion to the attention of the [[Decemvirate]].
> After a disastrous incident with an [[Artifact|artifact]] recovered by the [[Pathfinder Society]] and handled by the Ruby Prince, Amenopheus was stripped of his Osirian powers. He later sought out and helped [[Tahonikepsu]], the Diamond Sage, reform the [[Scarab Sages faction|Scarab Sages]] in pursuit of *sage stones* containing powerful, ancient lore.
