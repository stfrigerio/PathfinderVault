> **Tzakiv Korya** is the last of his line in [[Iobaria]]. He is descended from an ancestor who was among those who restored Iobaria in [[3304 AR]].
> He currently lacks the funds to re-establish Iobaria, but he makes the port-city [[Orlov]] his current capital while he schemes to restore Iobaria to its former glory. It is rumored that a mated pair of dragons hidden in Orlov have allied themselves with the Prince to help build his power base.
> The Prince has managed to build some alliances with adventure-seekers and investors in [[Cheliax]] and the [[River Kingdoms]].
