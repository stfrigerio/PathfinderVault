> **Lord Einmarch Henderthane** was until [[4709 AR]] the leader of the powerful [[House Henderthane|Henderthane family]] of [[Cheliax]].  As the chief arms merchant to the [[House Thrune]], Lord Henderthane was considered extremely loyal to the crown.  Only in his early fifties when he passed, Lord Henderthane's death was not seen as overly suspicious, and was not officially investigated by the guard or the [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]].  It was only when his daughter, Pavanna Henderthane, asked [[Varian Jeggare|Count Varian Jeggare]] to look into his death, that the truth was revealed: Einmarch had been murdered by the [[Devil|devil]] [[Orxines]] for failing to go along with a decades-old plot.
