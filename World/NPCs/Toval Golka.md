> **Toval Golka** is a [[Dwarf|dwarf]] from a clan in the [[Golushkin Mountains]]. He was sent as a ward to [[House Garess]] of [[Brevoy]]. While there he lost contact with his clan in [[4699 AR]], the same winter the [[House Rogarvia|rulers of Brevoy]] disappeared. Lord [[Howlan Garess]] lost his only son at the same time and has named Toval as his adoptive heir, which has proven to not be popular among the other nobles.  He has the makings of a skilled warrior.
