> **Inaminah Clov** is the owner of [[Dancing Cat|the Dancing Cat]], one of [[Vise|the Vises]] many notorious hostels, that has a particular reputation for protecting the anonymity of its clients. Her aspect as tight-lipped proprietor is a lie; in reality, Inaminah is a worshipper of the fell [[Deity|god]] [[Norgorber]] in his aspect as the Reaper of Reputations and is the head priestess of the local branch of the church. Some in [[Vyre]] know of Inaminah's secret faith, but most who do wrongly assume she is the high priest of the entire city, never realising how far the corrupting reach of the Church of Norgorber truly extends throughout the city.
