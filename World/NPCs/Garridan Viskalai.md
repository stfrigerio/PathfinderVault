> **Garridan Viskalai** is the proprietor of the [[The White Deer|White Deer Inn]], located in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of [[Sandpoint]]. He is proud of his [[Shoanti]] heritage and would love to return to the traditional [[ShoantiTribes of the ShoantiShriikirri-Quah|Shriikirri-Quah]] ways his parents left behind, but his wife Tannsy and children Rubus, Sarla, and Veedie keep him in town. Garridan's ties to his people's ways have driven a wedge between him and his brother, the town's sheriff, [[Belor Hemlock]], who has all but completely abandoned his ethnic heritage and embraced [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelaxian]] customs and beliefs. Even though the White Deer's rooms are much cleaner and bigger than those of the [[Rusty Dragon]], Garridan matches the price of his accommodation to that of the Rusty Dragon, but his gruff attitude makes his inn slightly less popular.
