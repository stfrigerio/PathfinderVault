> **High Prophet Kelldor** is the highest-ranking prophet of the [[Prophecies of Kalistrade]], *de facto* leader of [[Druma]], and one of the most powerful men in the [[Inner Sea region]]. He is famous for his business acumen and mastery of societal and economic necessities: his wealth, by far greater than any other Kalistocrat's, shows no sign of diminishing. According to many senior Kalistocrats, Kelldor owes his ascension to his ability to [[Magic/Divination|see]] almost everywhere across [[Golarion]], which, combined with his perceptive mind, grants him power just short of prophecy. He is engaged in a long-reaching, continent-spanning scheme, and secretly seeks to maintain the fragile peace between many Inner Sea nations and position Druma to withstand any possible war.


## Associates

> Holding the rank of high prophet, Kelldor wields near-total power over the affairs of other prophets and can retract the rulings of Druma's governing [[Resplendent Bureaucracy]], making him by far the most powerful man in the entire country.
> High Prophet Kelldor recognises the importance of allies, and knows every major political or civil leader in [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]] by name, but keeps a low profile in world affairs. He doesn't care about fame, only for wealth, the prime mover and abstract force of the universe, according to the [[Prophecies of Kalistrade]]. He is friendly and calm, and understands the interplay of non-financial factors in obtaining and maintaining wealth.
> Kelldor rarely leaves the Everlasting Palace in [[Kerse]], is guarded at all times by an elite [[Mercenary League]] contingent, and uses [[Magic|magic]] to communicate beyond the palace. Every [[Sun|sunrise]], he receives reports and letters, then meditates and prepares magic for a short time before spending most of the day planning or meeting with trusted aides and foreign leaders. Unlike many of his predecessors, Kelldor frequently communicates with other Avistani heads of state, and in recent years, he has invited foreign officials into the Everlasting Palace for sensitive topics that have to be discussed in person.
> The High Prophet and his contemporaries secretly own large tracts of [[Isger]] as investment, and in fulfillment of prophecy, the merchant lords plan to buy more.


## Background

> Very little is known about Kelldor's life before he became high prophet, and those researching him find great gaps in his biography. In recent years, he has commissioned several new [[Ship|ship]] designs from the shipyards in [[Detmer]], and ordered the Mercenary League to double its training and recruitment, while withdrawing Druma's long-standing support for [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]].
