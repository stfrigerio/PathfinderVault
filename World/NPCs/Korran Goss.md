> **Citizen Korran Goss** is a former chairman of the [[Revolutionary Council]] in the nation of [[Galt]].
> His rise to power came about when he uncovered the activities of the Cabinet of Skulls, the previous Galtan revolutionary council. A gifted demagogue, Goss had a talent for redirecting the mob's rage away from himself and the council, particularly by blaming neighboring nations for Galt's troubles.
> His rhetoric was a cause of concern for Galt's neighbors, who fear that violence could spill across their borders. Goss met his downfall when he was thrown to a rabid crowd, and was succeeded by [[Camilia Drannoch]]. He is currently incarcerated in the Monolith, a prison in [[Isarn]].
