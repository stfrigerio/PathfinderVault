> **Diauden** serves as an advisor to the current ruler of [[Ustalav]], [[Aduard Ordranti III|Prince Aduard Ordranti III]], although the exact nature of his position is shrouded in secrecy. Diauden is effectively the only person the [[Bureau of Special Affairs]] are answerable to and the Bureau itself is enshrouded in mystery. They operate out of the [[Whiteshaw]] building alongside [[Caliphas city|Caliphass]] police, the [[Department of Constables and Investigators]], but they do not fall within their jurisdiction and no one outside Diauden, the organisation, and perhaps Prince Odranti seem to know the Bureau's actual purpose.
