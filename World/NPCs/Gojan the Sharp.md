> **Gojan the Sharp**, or sometimes **Gojan Sharp**, was a [[Pathfinder]] whose exploits were recorded in Volume 3 of the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]*. 


## Background

> Gojan travelled to [[Numeria]] in [[4308 AR]] and endured a decade of hardship under the oppressive [[Ontar]], the [[Black Sovereign]] of Numeria, in order to gain access to the [[Silver Mount]]: a titanic edifice of steel that looms over Numeria's capital, [[Starfall]]. In [[4318 AR]], he finally earned Ontar's blessing to enter the forbidden lands and explore Silver Mount. While on his mission there, he cataloged the seven different types of local [[Skymetal|skymetal]], and observed the appearance of the [[Lawgiver]], the [[Herald|herald]] of [[Abadar]], in the city of [[Chesed]]. He also found and plundered the recreation deck within the Silver Mount during his investigation.
> His findings from [[Sulfur Gulch]], in the [[Sellen Hills]] of Numeria, were never published; they were hidden away by fellow Pathfinder [[Eylysia]] and were not discovered until some time around [[4716 AR]].


## Publication and disappearance

> Gojan returned to [[Absalom]] in [[4319 AR]], and the [[Pathfinder Society]] published a *Pathfinder Chronicles* volume detailing his journey and research later that year. In [[4320 AR]], Gojan returned to Numeria to learn more but disappeared and was never heard from again.
