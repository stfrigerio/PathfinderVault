> **Korvosa Regus** was an officer in the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] army during the [[Everwar]] of the 44th century AR.  He is remembered because he was [[Jakthion Korvosa|Field Marshal Jakthion Korvosa]]'s first commander, and because the young Jakthion took on the officer's surname after he was disowned by his own family.
