> **Drum Thornfiddle** is the self-proclaimed Gnome King of [[Brastlewark]], the city with the largest concentration of [[Gnome|gnomes]] in all of [[Avistan]] and quite possibly the world. Because of this, he could be considered the ruler of [[Gnome|gnomes]] everywhere, although many would dispute this. He is a sycophantic vassal of [[Abrogail Thrune II|Queen Abrogail II]], the queen of [[Cheliax]].
> Thornfiddle was responsible for forging the alliance with House Thrune (specifically Abrogail's grandmother shortly after her coronation) that has allowed Brastlewark to exist with relative autonomy. Though this arrangement has proven profitable, many now fear that he has promised too high a price and that it is only a matter of time when the rulers of Cheliax come to collect.
