> **Drandle Dreng** is the [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] of the [[Pathfinder Society]] who handles [[Pathfinder]] assignments concerning [[Absalom|Absaloms]] history and mysteries. He has a remarkable memory: he recalls hidden truths about the city's most important people that even they have forgotten. These secrets are not just gathered from Pathfinder agents: one of Dreng's most interesting habits is that, at least one day a week, he dons the "disguise" of a beggar and wanders the streets and markets of Absalom. When asked about this, he has replied, "Tongues are looser around the poor, and a beggar needs no [[Magic|magic]] to make himself invisible."


## History

> Venture-Captain Dreng filled in as [[Master of Scrolls]] for three months while [[Kreighton Shaine]] went on sabbatical in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].


## Appearance

> Venture-Captain Dreng's gray hair, paunch, cataracts, and generally unkempt appearance belie the seasoned Pathfinder's sharp intellect, wit, enthusiasm, and good sense of humor.
