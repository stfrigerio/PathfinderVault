> **Montlarion Jeggare** ([[4331 AR]]–[[4417 AR]]) considered himself a gentleman explorer. He was never seen without his monocle firmly in place. Despite the fact that his support was primarily financial and moral, Jeggare's contingent of marines, trappers, and scouts explored the [[Varisia|Varisian]] river that now bears his name (the [[Jeggare River]]) to its headwaters. Named the second lord magistrate of Korvosa on the death of Field Marshal Korvosa in [[4410 AR]], Jeggare died a pauper, having spent the entirety of his extensive wealth on the foundation of the city of [[Korvosa]].
