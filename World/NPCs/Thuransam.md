> **Thuransam** is a [[Cetus|cetus]] who makes his lair in the northern [[Obari Ocean]]. He is rumoured to have an enormous hoard; while this is true, most of this cache consists of worthless junk, as Thuransam is not intelligent enough to tell the difference between baubles and actual treasure. Nonetheless, he guards his collection ferociously.
