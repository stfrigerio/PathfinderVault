> **Master Alchemist Borume** represents the city of [[Oenopion]] on [[Nex]]'s ruling [[Council of Three and Nine]]. His main rival is [[Dunn Palovar]], representative of the city of [[Ecanus]]; each is tireless in his attempts to increase his own standing on the Council and reduce that of his opponent.
> Borume does not attend the Council in person. Instead, he transfers his consciousness into an [[Alchemy|alchemical]] contraption which he uses to attend the meetings.
