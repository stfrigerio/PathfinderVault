> **Marstead Vizcarra** was a merchant in the region that is now the [[Lambreth|River Kingdom of Lambreth]]. In [[4424 AR]], he overthrew the local lord, Igan Varklein, who was discovered to use [[Humanoid|humanoid]] [[Slavery|slaves]] to hunt for his own and his patrons' amusement. Marstead Vizcarra founded the small town of [[Sezgin]] and built and improved the roads linking the villages of the area to the rest of the realm. In [[4449 AR]], he also built the [[Raven Bridge]] across the Tolemaida River to link Sezgin to [[Daggermark]]. Over the years the [[Vizcarra family]] set up tanneries outside the town and built up Sezgin's reputation for fine leather working and as a center of the fur trade in river marten, otter, and beaver.
