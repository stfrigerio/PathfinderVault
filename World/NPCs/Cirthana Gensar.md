> **Lady Cirthana Gensar** often asks for assistance from the other clergy of her faith in her quest to aid the endangered [[Soul|souls]] of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]], but with the town being so close to the wild frontier, it is hard for the [[Iomedae|Iomedaean]] faith to survive. Would-be [[Paladin|paladins]] and up-and-coming [[Cleric|clerics]] find themselves extremely unprepared for the challenges of Falcon's Hollow, and most end up being pawns of the [[Lumber Consortium]], lured from their faith by bribes and tales of a better life, whether in the form of [[Gold|gold]] or free passes to the [[Rouge Lady]].
