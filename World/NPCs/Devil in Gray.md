> **The Devil in Gray** is a [[Winter wolf|winter wolf]] that has been terrorizing [[Lozeri]] since [[4698 AR]].


## Appearance

> The Devil in Gray, unusually for a winter wolf, has an ash gray pelt. It stands as tall as a fully grown [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|warhorse]] and it is said that its howl is able to [[Magic/Conjuration|summon]] [[Devil|devils]] to serve it and drives those who hear it mad with terror.


## History

> The Devil in Gray first appeared in 4698 AR when it savaged a lone washer woman, however, it seems to follow no predictable hunting pattern. Since its first attack, the Devil in Gray has become the most feared murderer in Lozeri, slaughtering entire hunting parties single handedly. In [[4701 AR]], the Devil in Gray invaded [[Chastel]], murdering almost twenty people in a single night. Though many claim to have slain the beast, the Devil in Gray always returns, some claim it must be a [[Werewolf|werewolf]] but even the [[Lycanthrope|lycanthropes]] of the [[Shudderwood]] are terrified of it. Though no [[Human|human]] hunter has ever been able to track the Devil in Gray back to its lair, the werewolves of the Shudderwood supposedly know its location, a place filled with grim trophies and a pack of hungry pups.
