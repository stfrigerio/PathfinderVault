> **Yargtha** was a [[Necromancer|necromancer]] from the land of [[Geb's Rest]], and the historic creator of the first [[Carrion golem|carrion golem]].  Before his death he was able to pass on the secret of its creation to his many [[Tiefling|tiefling]] children.  To this day, many tiefling [[Golemwright|golemwrights]] prefer creating carrion golems over all others, despite the smell.
