> **Nireed Wadincoast** is the proprietor of [[Silver Shore|Silver Shores]] most famous building, the unique [[Aquaretum]], which serves as [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] only aquarium as well as a unique museum. Nireed is renowned as a bit of an eccentric as is reflected by the bizarre collection of the Aquaretum. Despite his eccentricities Nireed is a known expert on life beneath the [[Varisian Gulf]]. He claims that hidden beneath the waves of the gulf are enormous sunken cities that would dwarf modern Magnimar, most pay no attention to these claims. With [[Varisia]] once being home to the ancient civilization of [[Thassilon]] and the realm of [[Bakrakhan]] slipping into the sea these tales are truer than most would guess.
