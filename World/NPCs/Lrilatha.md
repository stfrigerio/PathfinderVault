> The **Contessa Lrilatha** is an [[Erinys|erinys]] sent by [[Asmodeus]] himself to assist [[House Thrune]], the ruling family of [[Cheliax]]. Her title of *Contessa* does not fit in the standard hierarchy of Chelish noble ranks and may, therefore, be an infernal title. She was specifically instructed to help in the education of its current monarch, the young [[Abrogail Thrune II|Queen Abrogail II]].
