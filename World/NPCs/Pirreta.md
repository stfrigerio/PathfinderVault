> **Pirreta** is one of the so called [[Kings and Queens of Vyre|Queens]] of [[Vyre]], secretly serving as the Queen of Blood. While all Vyre's kings and queens keep their identity secret, Pirreta is served by a group of loyal guards, the [[Masks of Blood]], who help assist citizens of Vyre in legal matters, and see to the defence of Vyre against foreign interests. Queen of Blood Pirreta is a type of [[Naga|naga]] known as a [[Lunar naga|lunar naga]] and, whilst they are amongst the weakest of their kind, Pirreta is one of the most influential figures in Vyre. Pirreta is also the owner of the hostel [[Heavenly House|The Heavenly House]] in the [[Old Vyre]] neighbourhood of [[Vise|the Vise]], though she leaves most of the day-to-day management to the self-deprecating [[Golath Thamus|Slip King Golath Thamus]].
