> The **Worg Queen** is a murderous [[Goblin|goblin]] who, in [[4669 AR]], organized an army of [[Bugbear|bugbears]], goblins, and [[Worg|worgs]] to make war on the [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Loric Fells|Loric Fellss]] outpost known as [[Rookwarden Fells|Rookwarden]], and its outlying hills, known as [[Rookwarden Fells]].
> The raid was a success: the group of monsters destroyed nearly every [[Human|human]] settlement within ten miles of Rookwarden. It would be nearly a full human generation before the region would be reclaimed by humans.
> The Worg Queen was driven out of Rookwarden by a coven of [[Green hag|green hags]], former allies who leveraged their control of a half dozen [[Troll|troll]] tribes to defeat their former mistress.
