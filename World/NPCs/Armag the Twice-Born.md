> **Armag the Twice-Bo[[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarian]]Lords]] [[Barbarian|barbarian]] tribe, which currently serves as mercenaries for [[Pitax]]. He was raised by cultists of [[Gyronna]] to believe he was the reborn ancient Tiger Lords chieftain [[Armag]] and reportedly either seeks or already wields Armag's legendary [[Sword|sword]] *[[Nethys/Artifacts/Ovinrbaane]]*.
