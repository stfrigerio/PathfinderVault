> **Arazni** is a [[Demigod|demigoddess]] of the abused, dignity, and unwilling [[Undead|undeath]]. Before this, she was originally an [[Adventurer|adventurer]] who sought to improve her country, then the [[Herald|herald]] of a [[Deity|god]] who abandoned her to [[Evil|evil]] [[Necromancy|necromancers]], and, most recently, a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] ruler of the [[Garund|Garundi]] nation of [[Geb's Rest]], when [[Geb (person)|Geb]] himself had withdrawn from the day-to-day running of the country. She abandoned both Geb, the nation, and Geb, the ruler, in [[4719 AR]]. Arazni now cherishes her newfound freedom, embraces cruelty and power to defend herself, exacts terrible vengeance against her enemies, and holds scorn for those who think to venerate her.



## Background


### Origins

> Arazni was born in [[Gujaraldi]], capital of the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] nation of [[Xopatl]], during its golden age. She studied the [[Ley line|ley lines]] near Gujaraldi and made great advancements in improving the water quality in nearby aquifers. Thereafter, she came to [[Jolizpan]] to expand her research and understanding of the Veins of Creation, where she befriended the [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] traveller [[Aroden]], and together they earned limited access to [[Tumbaja Mountain]], heart of the Veins of Creation.
> After completing the research she needed, Arazni invited Aroden to travel across Xopatl to apply her research from Gujaraldi to distant communities. For the next several years, they earned a reputation as heroes. In [[-1505 AR]], they returned to Jolizpan to report on their improvements, in the process repelling an invasion by the [[Razatlan|Razatlani]] warlord Imictal, who sought to claim the Veins of Creation for his country. Following this exploit, Arazni and Aroden were granted unlimited access to Tumbaja Mountain.
> After spending a few years studying the kumaru tree that was the source of the Veins of Creation, Arazni grew content with what she knew and parted ways with Aroden to continue improving Xopatl, while he continued his experiments on the kumaru tree. In [[-1491 AR]], Arazni killed and was killed by the terrible beast Tlochach when taming the plains of western Xopatl. Her [[Soul|soul]] was judged and sent to [[Nirvana]] by [[Pharasma]], where she eventually became an [[Astral deva|astral deva]].
> In [[1121 AR]], Arazni met her old friend Aroden again, who asked her to become involved in the affairs of [[Golarion]] once more. She became his [[Herald|herald]], and later a [[Demigod|demigod]]. Very little is known of her from this time, although several sources do mention that she was acquainted with [[Sunlord Thalachos]], the herald of the goddess [[Sarenrae]].
> She served as the patron saint of the [[Knights of Ozem]], a religious military order that fought against the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] during the [[Shining Crusade]] in the 39th century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]]. The Knights [[Summon|summoned]] her in [[3818 AR]] to lead them in battle; although she was perfectly willing to take the fight to the Tyrant herself, the Knights decided to [[Binding outsiders|bind]] her to their will, seeing such a thing as necessary in the face of Tar-Baphon and planting seeds of doubt and resentment in her mind. She was ultimately humiliated and slain by the Tyrant in [[3823 AR]]. In an effort to demoralize his opponents, the lich threw her broken body back to her knights during the [[Battle of Three Sorrows]].
> After the end of the crusade, in [[38' AR]], her body was finally interred by the Knights of Ozem in their new citadel in the young nation of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]]. Her body did not remain there for very long, however, as it was stolen in [[3890 AR]] at the behest of the ghost-king Geb in retaliation for a failed assault on his kingdom by the Knights of Ozem. Geb himself transformed the assailants into [[Graveknight|graveknights]] and sent them to rampage through [[Vigil]] and steal her corpse, to be brought to his nation.
> Geb took a year and a day to drag Arazni's soul back from the [[Great Beyond]]. Over a period of years, Geb used his subtle, yet powerful influence on Arazni, fixating on the doubt and resentment that the Knights of Ozem planted, eventually corrupting her into a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] with none of her former personality. He even turned her against her former allies, particularly [[Iomedae]], her successor as Aroden's herald, who herself had been a [[Paladin|paladin]] of Arazni before the death of the demigoddess. Geb propped her up as his Harlot Queen and delegated to her the responsibility of administration, which he saw as beneath him.


### Ruler of Geb

![[Arazni.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Arazni as ruler of Geb.
> Although not nearly as powerful as she once was as a demigod, Arazni is still a potent force in her own right. She rules Geb from the [[Cinerarium]] in the centre of [[Mechitar]], allowing Geb to focus on more esoteric matters, without having to trouble himself with matters of state. Arazni has no love for her [[Undead|undead]] citizens of Geb, and despises the people of Lastwall, who condemned her to undeath, even more. Harnessing her will and dedication to become the tyrannical ruler necessary to rule an undead nation, she continues to keep the scheming and independent-minded undead who help run the country from seizing power for themselves, and strives to be a better leader than Geb could fathom. Her leadership has kept Geb stable for the last 800 years.
> Arazni has a retinue of [[Graveknight|graveknights]] dubbed the Council Libertine, re-animated by Geb from the former Knights of Ozem who originally stole her corpse from Vigil: [[Amaretos Manslayer]], [[Seldeg Bhedlis]], [[Gustari Fallenstag]], Tycha Ghuzmaar, [[Yhalas]], Ammar Ilverazto, and Andvard Prollin. Among them, the first five remain, while the latter two have been destroyed by the Knights of Ozem. Rumours in Lastwall and [[Taldor]] paint them as her concubines and champions, but their true, little-known role is to watch over her on Geb's behalf, dragging her back to Geb when she tries to flee the nation. Arazni was conditioned to be unable to raise her hand against the Council Libertine, making her helpless against them despite her comparative power over them; she had to manipulate the Knights of Ozem into thinning the ranks of her captors. Arazni's [[Phylactery|phylactery]] is kept carefully hidden from her, making her as much Geb's prisoner as ruler of his nation.
> Although she embraced the hatred that Geb cultivated, Arazni kept hoping that her old friend Aroden would return to save her. He never did, and when he died, Arazni sank further into despair, and realised that when Tar-Baphon killed her, they had been linked together for some reason; the hateful whispers that she had heard since then were not her own, but Tar-Baphon's. In [[4719 AR]], through this tenuous connection, Arazni felt that his rage had been replaced with hope, and suspected that he was regaining his freedom soon. For the first time in centuries, she finally escaped her graveknight jailers and moved north, just in time to watch the destruction wrought by the Tyrant's new superweapon *Radiant Fire*.
> Her whereabouts are unknown, and in the wake of Arazni's disappearance, her erstwhile husband was forced to take a more hands-on approach to ruling his kingdom.


## Arazni's weakness

> Many of Arazni's internal organs were removed before her reanimation as a lich and placed in special canopic jars known as the *[[Bloodstones of Arazni]]*. Arazni is concerned that these organs could one day be used against her, and has done her best over the centuries to track them down and destroy them, including using her retinue of former Knights of Ozem to search for them, but with little success. As these jars hold a fraction of Arazni's former [[Deity|divine]] power, her bodyguard-jailers want them destroyed, while Arazni hopes to recover them.


## Relationships

 
 Arazni in more modern times.
> Arazni considers most other deities callous and contemptible, especially Aroden, for having left her to die at Tar-Baphon's hands. Her old acquaintances during her time as Aroden's herald consider her both blasphemous and tragic, and no longer associate with her.
> Arazni shares some values with other divinities: [[Gyronna]], for the hatred born from cruel abuse; [[Lamashtu]], for how a weak creature can fight their way to power; and [[Erecura]], for ruling a realm not quite theirs. However, the cooperation is mostly limited to their followers; Arazni keeps to herself and other deities rarely notice her.
> Arazni is both resentful of her successor [[Iomedae]] for having reached divinity so successfully and easily, and proud of her for having won the Shining Crusade, and recognises that none should be subjected to her ordeals. She also came to care for the adventurers who aided her against Tar Baphon, sending them away from the explosion of the *Radiant Fire*.


## Cults

> Worship of Arazni takes two different forms, one within Geb's borders and one outside Geb. Most citizens of Geb view Arazni as a secular head of state, and only a few also venerate her as a spiritual figure of undead nobility and leadership. [[Cleric|Clerics]] of Arazni are very rare; most of her priests serve the bureaucratic role of operating state-sponsored temples dedicated to her. Their incapacity in using [[Divine magic|divine magic]] is not viewed as a shortcoming, as that expectation usually falls to clerics of [[Urgathoa]]. Since abandoning both the nation and ruler in [[4719 AR]], Arazni has held nothing but contempt for her former Gebbite devotees.
> Outside of Geb, Arazni has no priests, and her faith is silently practiced by solitary devotees, who view her as an exemplar of an abused victim who nonetheless manages to guard herself and project confidence, when all control over her circumstances has been taken away. In this way, she is most often worshipped by Taldan women and commoners, [[Cheliax|Chelish]] [[Halfling|halflings]] and [[Tiefling|tieflings]], [[Mwangi]] natives in [[Sargava]], and intelligent undead who hate their existence but cannot end it. In Lastwall, Arazni is viewed as a dead goddess, but a few still uphold her teachings of protection. Most Knights of Ozem do not want to dwell on the failure that led to her death, but maintain the shrine where she was once interred in the hope that she could find rest there in the future. Since the fall of Lastwall, some surviving Knights of Lastwall in the [[Gravelands]] who resent how badly their former leaders failed them have turned to her worship, but they are few in number and scattered, and most consider her overly harsh and vindictive.
> Arazni resents her worshippers for venerating what she has become, but also tolerates them, finding a vicarious fulfillment in having followers. She values her privacy, and any cleric who would try to [[Magic/Divination|divine]] her secrets will find their powers taken away.


## Herald's Fall

***Main article: [[Herald's Fall|Heralds Fall]]***
> Ever since the death of Arazni at the hands of Whispering Tyrant, a strange phenomenon has been witnessed at various locations in the vicinity of [[Ustalav]]. Dubbed [[Herald's Fall|Heralds Fall]] by the [[Brevoy|Brevic]] [[Spiritualist|spiritualist]] Kalara Atroshka, the event appears as a type of mobile [[Haunt|haunt]] that is directly connected to the emotional trauma experienced by Arazni around the moment of her death. This emotional and [[Psychic|psychic]] trauma seems to have created some sort of powerful resonance on the [[Ethereal Plane]] that occasionally manifests on the [[Material Plane|Material]], and seems to follow a predetermined path of local Ustalavic [[Ley line|ley lines]].
