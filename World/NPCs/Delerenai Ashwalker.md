> **High Priestess Delerenai Ashwalker** leads the [[Imvrildarai]], a militaristic sect of [[Calistria|Calistrians]] deep in the southern [[Fierani Forest]].



## Appearance

> High Priestess Ashwalker is a light-skinned, blonde-haired [[Elf|elf]]. When equipped for battle, she wears a [[Mithral|mithral]] [[Nethys/Equipment/Armors/Breastplate|breastplate]] and sanctified [[Whip|whip]].


## Relatives

> Ashwalker's wife, Esaril, was the Imvrildarai's master of arms before she was killed in an ambush around [[4670 AR]]. The High Priestess keeps the skull of a [[Babau|babau]] in her quarters in Esaril's memory.


## Associates

> The High Priestess is advised by the heads of the Imvrildarai's two remaining houses: [[Almeredei Songbreaker]], head of the Scions of Deceit, and [[Keshmarada]], head of the Scions of Revenge. Her opinion of visitors to the temple is largely determined by whether they support her leadership.


## Background

> Ashwalker, herself a former head of the Scions of Revenge, was appointed High Priestess after the assassination of the previous High Priest, [[Rekaereil Sandurei]]. Sandurei was a moderate and an archivist, and Ashwalker brings a more militant mindset to the sect.
