> **Hao Jin** was a powerful [[Sorcerer|sorceress]] who lived in the city of [[Goka]], on the continent of [[Tian Xia]]. She was also known as **the Ruby Phoenix** for her bright red hair that grew an ever-brighter shade of red whenever she arose from the dead by resurrection [[Magic|magic]].



## Background

> Hao Jin was born in Goka to an [[Abadar|Abadaran]] priestess and a painter who emphasised the importance of order and creativity in her life. She loved exploring the Empress Yin Museum, home to countless relics from [[Yixing]], whose stewards were fond of her but often told her to be more careful around the exhibits. Her recklessness eventually burnt the museum, killing Hao Jin and destroying countless exhibits. Her parents, at great expense, had her resurrected, igniting her talent as a sorcerer.


### Collection

> Hao Jin's resurrection and the irrevocable damage she did to the museum changed Hao Jin. As her powers developed, Hao Jin sought to recreate her [[Deity|deitys]] collection of [[Magic item|magic items]], wealth, and treasure in a [[Mortal|mortal]] version of the [[First Vault]], like how her patron [[Abadar]] does. After living for several centuries, Hao Jin succeeded in accumulating an impressive collection but eventually realized that her hoard was only safe while she lived. In response, Hao Jin strove for [[Immortality|immortality]], driven by her desire to acquire the greatest collection of magical wonders from across [[Golarion]], but such power consistently eluded her. Fearing her collection would be stolen, broken up, or simply lost to history, she made plans for her eventual permanent demise.
> The crown jewel of Hao Jin's collection was the *[[Hao Jin Tapestry]]*, a personal [[Demiplane|demiplane]] that she created to house entire communities and geographical features and safeguard her most dangerous treasures.


### Ruby Phoenix Tournament

> Among her many contracts and pacts, Hao Jin made an arrangement with the Temple of Abadar in Goka. If she did not return to the temple after a decade and a day, then she would be declared dead and a competition of martial skills would be held every decade after that date. Under supervision from the clergy of Abadar, the greatest combatants of the age would compete for the fame and glory of emerging the ultimate warrior. The victor would then choose a single item as a final prize from Hao Jin's collection. These games would be called the [[Ruby Phoenix Tournament]].
> Content with her creation, Hao Jin departed Golarion for good and moved to [[Axis]]. By 4391 AR, Hao Jin had not returned to the temple of Abadar for ten years. In accordance with her agreement, the priests of Abadar enacted her contract and made plans to create the first Ruby Phoenix Tournament. It would be held in a decade's time, in [[4401 AR]].
> Hao Jin was an expert in the [[Element|elements]].
