> **Pharaoh Khemet II**, known as the **Crocodile King** was the son of the great Pharaoh [[Khemet I]] and ruled [[Osirion]] after his father. He was [[Pharaoh|pharaoh]] from [[4649 AR]] to [[4678 AR]], and was succeeded by his son [[Khemet III]], the Ruby Prince.
> Khemet II inherited his father's [[Magic|magical]] ability, but not his rulership skills. He preferred to spend his time with his extensive harem rather than deal with matters of state. He died in a [[Magic/Conjuration|summoning]] accident.
> One of his younger brothers was Prince [[Kasiya]].
