> **Kroghut** is the chieftain of the newly formed [[Bearslayer tribe|Bearslayer]] orc tribe. The tribe began raiding [[Trunau|Trunaus]] outer holdings in [[4713 AR]] because Kroghut feels the need to show his strength.


## Background

> Kroghut was the leader of the [[Broken Spine tribe|Broken Spine]] [[Orc|orc]] tribe that occupies an abandoned keep in the foothills of the [[Mindspin Mountains]] known as [[Heliu's Folly|Helius Folly]].
> A [[Pathfinder]] named [[Eando Kline]] burned down the Broken Spine's keep in [[4707 AR]]. Chief Kroghut survived the inferno but had to flee to avoid execution for incompetence by his humiliated tribe.
