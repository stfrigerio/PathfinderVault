> **Baroness Stepanya** is the ruler of the town of [[Sascha]], in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of the [[Verge]]. Baroness Stepanya complains that she cannot sleep at night. Her cold keep is haunted by fiery visions of the burning bodies of the residents of the town of [[Ermalin]] which once stood upon the site of the current town; [[Sascha person|Queen Sascha]] had put Ermalin to the torch after a minor peasant uprising. Priests of [[Zon-Kuthon]] and [[Lamashtu]] have been unable to dispel these incorporeal haunts.
