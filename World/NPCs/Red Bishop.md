> The **Red Bishop** is a [[Mothman|mothman]] [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Pazuzu]] who seeks to attract the attention of the [[Demon|demon]] [[Uvaglor]] to the [[Lost Coast]] and turn the [[Pit Sandpoint hinterlands|Pit]] into a [[Portal|portal]] to Uvaglor's realm in the [[Abyss]]. However, the Red Bishop cannot do this until a ward left in the Pit by Sazzleru, a long-dead priestess of [[Ashava]], is destroyed, which can only be done by powerful non-[[Evil|evil]] [[Mortal|mortals]]. As a result, the Red Bishop has committed numerous atrocities, from corrupting [[Jervis Stoot]] into a serial killer, to enslaving the inhabitants of [[Grubber's Hermitage|Grubbers Hermitage]], in order to attract heroes to the [[Sandpoint Hinterlands]]. At such a point, he plans to appear in front of the heroes to ask them for their help in destroying the ward, so that he and his minions would leave [[Sandpoint]] alone. Otherwise, the Red Bishop would burn Sandpoint to the ground and ensure that everyone who dies would blame the heroes for their refusal to help him; while, if they accept, he would keep his word, but the devastation wrought by the unleashed Uvaglor and his minions would be far greater.
