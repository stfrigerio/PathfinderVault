> The massive **Grand Bridge of the Empire** was built 3,000 years ago to connect [[Oppara]] with the southern shore of [[River Porthmos]]. It emerges from [[Grandbridge]], the central district of Oppara, stretches 8,134 feet across the river and ends at the [[Grandbridge Vagabond Camp]] on the southern shore. It is a cantilever bridge set atop enormous stone piles sunk deep into the Porthmos. The rest of the span is made of [[Magic|magically]] strengthened [[Mithral|mithral]] steel, forged in [[Maheto]]. Its longest arch, at the center of its span, is 150 feet, for [[Ship|ships]] of all kinds to pass beneath. The span's surface is covered by mosaic tiles on a foundation of thin granite sheets. It took more than 200 years to be built, at enormous cost to the empire.
