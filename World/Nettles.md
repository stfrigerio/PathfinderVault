> **Nettles** is one of several neighbourhoods that comprise the residential district of [[Pauper's Palace|Paupers Palace]] in the sin-soaked city of [[Vyre]]. Nettles provides some relief for the city's residents from the hustle, the bustle, and the sheer debauchery of [[Bliss]] and [[Vise|the Vise]]. Nettles is one of Pauper's Palace's more middle-class neighbourhoods, confusingly bordered to the north by [[Southmarket]], to the east by the [[Whispers|the Whispers]], and by [[Graystone]] to the west.
