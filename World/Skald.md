*For another meaning of "Skald", please see [[Skald language]].*
> Like [[Bard's End|bards]], **skalds** use their performance talents to inspire allies. The skald's violent nature, however, twists this inspiration into calls for [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|heroic rage]]. As scholars, they record and retell stories of valor and prowess in battle; as [[Art|artists]], their nuanced and multidimensional creativity reflects their ability to emulate a versatile range of [[Magic|magical]] abilities. And in combat, skalds push forward with the front lines into melee combat to better experience the bloody stories they will tell for years to come.
