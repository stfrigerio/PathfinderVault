> By far [[Magnimar]]'s most seedy, dangerous and dirty district, **Underbridge** is the only district in what is known as the **[[Shadow Magnimar district|Shadow]]** area of Magnimar because it lies beneath the shade of the [[Irespan]]. Rat infested Underbridge is filled with gambling dens, rancid brothels, cheap flop houses and decrepit tenements serving as a collection of the worst vices of the city. 
> While the Magnimar government has pledged to clean up Underbridge, many members of the [[Council of Ushers]] realise that the vice-filled district actually helps attract business to Magnimar and that shutting it down may adversely affect the rest of Magnimar. Despite being a shore-side district Underbridge does not have the bustling docks of the [[Bazaar of Sails]] or [[Dockway]] but there are a few places to dock. 
> These Underbridge docks are inevitably used for smuggling, the most infamous of which backs on to the [[Friendly Merchant]]: a shady tavern whose owner charges extortionate rates to use his smuggling dock.
> Members of the [[Magnimar city watch]] who patrol this district call the people who attack from its darkness "living shadows".
