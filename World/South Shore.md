 South Shore lies on the upper left of this picture of the city of Korvosa.
> The newest district of the city of [[Korvosa]], South Shore was only founded at the end of the 47th century AR. Located on the south-western edge of mainland Korvosa next to the [[Gray district|Gray District]], it does not suffer from the overcrowding that plagues the rest of the city. Because of this, it is a highly sought-after residence for the city's new-money elite. It is also home to the [[Pantheon of Many]], Korvosa's ecumenical cathedral.
