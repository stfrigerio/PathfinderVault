> Among the countless legions of [[Daemon|daemons]] on the plane of [[Abaddon]], a few are able to distinguish themselves and rise in power above even the [[Deacon|deacons]] of the [[Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]. These unique individuals are collectively known as **harbingers**, and they rank in power above all other daemons, save the archdaemons. Most maintain small cults on Abaddon and elsewhere, granting power to their worshipers. They are largely subservient to one of the archdaemons, although they are also their greatest competitors.
