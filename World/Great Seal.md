> The ***Great Seal*** is a powerful ward intended to contain the [[Spirit|spirit]] of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] within the tower of [[Gallowspire]] in [[Ustalav]]. The *Great Seal* actually consists of four seals, three lesser and one greater, but only the *Great Seal* is located in Gallowspire. The three lesser seals are watched over by the victors of the [[Shining Crusade]], and are intended to support the [[Magic|magic]] of the greater.



## History

> At the end of the Shining Crusade in [[38' AR]], the victorious armies were faced with a dilemma. The body of the Whispering Tyrant had been destroyed by a fragment of the *[[Shield of Aroden]]* wielded by the [[Taldan]] [[Arnisant|General Arnisant]], but the [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lichs]] [[Soul|soul]] still lived within its [[Phylactery|phylactery]] deep underneath the tower of Gallowspire. Unwilling or unable to confront the [[Necromancer|necromancers]] minions in his inner sanctum, they instead decided to turn the Whispering Tyrant's throne into his prison. First conjuring the lesser seals, [[Narthoc]], a high-priest of [[Aroden]], instructed his fellows to take the seals far away from [[Ustalav]] so they could be hidden and protected away from Tar-Baphon's influence. After the remains of the lich's body were entombed underneath Gallowspire, Narthoc then placed the final, greater seal down to ensure the Whispering Tyrant would never escape.


## Description

> The *Great Seal* is located on the first level below the tower of Gallowspire. Simply accessing it requires tremendous effort, as it is guarded not only by deadly traps placed there by the armies of the Shining Crusade, but also the countless [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/undead|undead]] that still make their home in the tower. The most powerful of these are a [[Vampire|vampiric]] [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/elf|elven]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] named [[Iliamaniss]], who seeks a way to bypass the *Great Seal*, and the animated remains of three unknown soldiers who rose as [[Ghast|ghasts]] to keep out trespassers.


### The Final Guardian

> A powerful [[Sphinx|sphinx]] [[Oracle|oracle]] named [[Shadnusaptera]] is the final living guardian of the *Great Seal*. She was placed here by the leaders of the Shining Crusade and tasked to defend it with her life. She is kept alive by the magic of the *Great Seal*, which also sustains her without food and water. She attacks anyone not carrying a piece of the shattered *Shield of Aroden*, and since these fragments are heavily guarded in secret, few are able to approach her unmolested.


### Magic of the *Great Seal*

> The protective magics of the *Great Seal* are so powerful that the physical structure of the dungeons below Gallowspire cannot be physically manipulated by [[Mortal|mortals]]. Additionally, anyone using magic to transport into the dungeons is kept from leaving by the same means. The strength of the [[Spell|spells]] is strong enough to even keep [[Summoned|summoned]] creatures from returning to their home [[Plane|plane]].


### Opening the *Great Seal*

> The magic of the *Great Seal* is extremely powerful, the cumulative effect being that the dungeons beneath Gallowspire are now impregnable. The only way for someone to breach the magic is to locate and disable all three of the lesser seals (*see below*).


## The Lesser Seals

> The lesser seals were created at the same time as the *Great Seal*. The high-priest of Aroden, Narthoc, ordered each of the parties that took part in the Shining Crusade ([[Taldor]], the [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/dwarf|dwarves]] of the [[Kraggodan|Kingdom of Kraggodan]], and the [[Knights of Ozem]]) to take them far away from Ustalav, so that the *Great Seal* could never be opened.
