> **Last Rites** is a store in the [[Ankar-Te]] [[Ring district]] of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]].  It is owned and run by [[Horus Ilaktya]], who also oversees this unusual neighborhood with [[Shamalay Kasan|High Priestess Shamalay Kasan]].  Horus is a talented [[Necromancer|necromancer]], and Last Rites is a supplier of custom-created undead for use as menial servants, mounts, and laborers.  He prefers to refer to his merchandise as "[[Twice-Born]]", rather than undead, and thinks there is nothing wrong with his chosen profession.  Since his creations are usually homicidal after being imbued with unlife, Horus has created special control-amulets known as [[Death's head talisman|deaths head talisman]], which allow the purchaser full control over his "reborn" minions.
> Horus is always looking for fresh "raw materials" for his work, and will readily purchase fresh corpses. However, he is careful not to be seen to encourage grave-robbing, so he always checks the provenance of the bodies he buys.
