> The moss-covered **Harrowstone Memorial** stands at the far south-west of the town of [[Ravengro]] on the eastern banks of the Ravengro Creek, a site which is one of the closest points in the town to the [[Harrowstone]] Prison; the prison itself stands on a hill to the south of the town. The stone memorial commemorates the 25 people who died in the fire of [[4661 AR]], which totally destroyed the Harrowstone Prison: they were the prison's warden [[Lyvar Hawkran]], his wife [[Vesorianna Hawkran]], and the prison guards. The names of the dead are etched at the base of the statue below a 25 foot sculpture of Warden Hawkran in uniform, wielding a truncheon. The memorial was built by the people of Ravengro shortly after the fire, as a statement of appreciation for the sacrifices made that night preventing the escape of [[Ustalav]]'s most dangerous criminals.
> Today the Memorial is a site for lovers' trysts and as close to the haunted grounds of the Harrowstone prison that most people will dare to go.
