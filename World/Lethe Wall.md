> The ***Lethe Wall*** is a [[Protean|protean]] [[Artefact|artefact]] appearing as a non-living wall of black stone that moves through the city of [[Galisemni]].
> Generally viewed as [[Curse|cursed]], the locals will temporarily move away when the wall approaches their neighbourhood. When a creature willingly carves its name on the wall the Lethe Wall consumes that name, erasing all of their traces from history, including their own memories. The Lethe Wall will then grant them their greatest wish, altering events so they unfolded without the creatures' participation.
> A rare few retain some or all memories of their previous lives, and call themselves the Wyrmtouched; most of the rest eventually return to society, blissfully ignorant of what they did.
