> **The Pantheon of Many** is a temple devoted to almost all of the main [[Deities|deities]] of the [[Inner Sea region|Inner Sea]] that sits in the [[South Shore]] district of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]]. The Pantheon of Many contains shrines to all the core deities of the Inner Sea except for [[Gorum]], [[Lamashtu]], and [[Rovagug]]. Originally, neither [[Cayden Cailean]] nor [[Desna]] had a shrine within the Pantheon but, when huge crowds of their worshippers blockaded the Pantheon before its opening, their shrines were swiftly added.
> Each god's shrine is equally sized and equally respected. [[Cleric|Clerics]] and priests of each religion are allowed to practice their personal rites and rituals without interference as long as they abide by the laws of Korvosa, and regardless of whether the religion is [[Evil|evil]] or [[Chaotic|chaotic]]. The only restriction is that no sacrifices, [[Human|human]] or [[Animal|animal]], are allowed.
