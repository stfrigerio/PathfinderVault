 The [[Grand Lodge]] in [[Absalom]], a Pathfinder lodge.
> **Pathfinder lodges,** also known as outposts or chapter houses, are the accommodation build by the [[Pathfinder Society]] to house its members, their research, and [[Artifact|artifacts]] found during their explorations. The basic purpose of the lodge is to provide support for [[Pathfinder|Pathfinder Society members]]: a place to sleep, a library for research, meeting rooms to converse and plan, and mechanisms to communicate with other lodges.

 The Exalted Lodge of [[Razmiran]].
> There is no such thing as a canonical Pathfinder lodgeâ€”it could be a log cabin or a majestic fortress. But the following things must be true to give it true lodge status:

> - It can only be founded by a member of the Pathfinder Society.
> - The lodge founder must own a minimum of one volume of the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]*, to be kept in the lodge.
> - The lodge must provide access to texts that specialize in the region in which the lodge resides: geography, flora/fauna, demographics, *etc.*
> - The lodge must honor the requests of any [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] seeking aid.
> - The lodge must uphold the policy of tolerance and respect to all Pathfinders. The lodge is a safe-house for all Society members, regardless of religious beliefs, political persuasion, gender, or race.
