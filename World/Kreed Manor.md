> The home of [[Thuldrin Kreed]] is more of a residential fortress than a mansionâ€”10-foot-high [[Darkwood|darkwood]] walls surround **Kreed Manor**, protected by some of the hardiest rogues in the [[Redrock Guild]] and guarded by the most vigilant sell-swords that the [[Lumber Consortium]] can purchase, making the manor nearly impenetrable. Rioters from the city have attempted to burn the [[Kreed family]] out, prompting the Kreeds to add four additional towers within the mansion's walls. When [[Harpy|harpies]] began attacking the upper floors of their home on [[Moon|moonless]] nights, the Kreeds placed an always-present group of guards with [[Crossbow|crossbows]] on the roof, and in response to an intruder who changed shape and walked through the front gates, they also instigated the rigorous use of passwords. The Kreeds' survival of [[Darkmoon Vale|Darkmoon Vales]] terrors for over a century is no accident.
