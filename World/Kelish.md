![[Qadirans.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Most [[Qadira|Qadirans]] speak [[Taldane]] as well as any [[Inner Sea region]] culture, but Kelish is their primary language.
> **Kelish** is the language of the [[Kelesh|Great Padishah Empire of Kelesh]] east of the [[Inner Sea]], including its westernmost [[Inner Sea region]] satrapy of [[Qadira]]. It is a throaty, phlegmatic language rich with poetry, scholarly writing, and history, having served the empire for countless generations. It is also widely spoken by the [[Genie|genies]] of that land.



## History

> Kelish is derived from the tribal languages spoken within the Padishah Empire of Kelesh. Also known as [[Old Keleshite]], these languages were more grammatically complex with sounds not commonly used in other regions. Their unique and often difficult nature slowed the spread of Keleshite influence, leading merchants to create a simplified trade version that shared more in common phonologically with languages found outside of [[Casmaron]].


## Features and grammar

> Kelish has six vowel sounds (a, e, i, o, u, which can be short or long; and É™, which is either silent or pronounced as a [[httpenwikipediaorgschwa|schwa]]). In most cases, *r* sounds are trilled with the tip of the tongue, while a second *r* sound is instead rolled. The spoken language also uses glottal stops.
> Most words stress the final syllable.


## Script

> Kelish uses an [[httpenwikipediaorgabjad|abjad]] script, and written Kelish contains only consonants. Each consonant can have two inflections, commonly referred to as "soft" and "hard", depending on context.

## In the Inner Sea region

> Kelesh is widely spoken in the [[Inner Sea region]] in [[Absalom]], [[Alkenstar]], [[Geb's Rest]], [[Katapesh]], [[Nex]], [[Taldor]], and of course [[Qadira]], the westernmost satrapy of the Great Empire. The traders of Kelesh are so ubiquitous, that the language is even spoken by a sizable minority in the great city of [[Goka]], in distant Tian Xia.
> Despite its usage as a trade language, it remains complex compared to [[Taldane]] and is inconsistently transcribed, making it difficult for Taldane speakers to learn.
