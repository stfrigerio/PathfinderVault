 A [[Liavaran dreamer]] feeds from a ley line.
> A **ley line** is an imperceptible, nearly stationary conduit of raw [[Magic|magical]] energy that can stretch thousands of miles, and includes [[Psychic magic|psychic impressions]] among its ambient energy. Scholars suspect ley lines imbue magical effects, thoughts, and phenomena to reality along their paths.
> The concept of ley lines is part of the [[Occult|occult]] [[Philosophy|philosophy]] of [[Cosmic biology|cosmic biology]], which suggests the [[Planet|planets]] of the [[Material Plane]], and the material of other [[Plane|planes]], is itself alive.



## Appearance

> Most ley lines are invisible to the naked eye, with the exception of those that pass through areas with high levels of ambient energy, such as areas of [[Wild magic|wild magic]] or [[Negative energy|negative energy]]. They move too slowly for most [[Mortal|mortals]] to perceive, drifting only slightly over millennia.
> A person can detect ley lines through [[Spell|spellcasting]] and [[Occult|occult]] abilities, which reveals them as colored streams of ghostly energy. The line's power corresponds with its color, following a similar pattern to the [[httpenwikipediaorgvisible light spectrum|visible light spectrum]]: violet lines are the weakest, and red lines are the strongest.


## Use in ritual magic

## On distant worlds

> [[Liavara]] is so densely populated with ley lines that the [[Brethedan]] settlers sent to colonize the world entered meditative trances focused on the ley lines after their arrival. Becoming [[Liavaran dreamer|Liavaran dreamers]], these more individualistic Brethedans fly into a rage if detached from a ley line but are capable of finding and feeding from them on [[Bretheda]], and likely other worlds as well.
