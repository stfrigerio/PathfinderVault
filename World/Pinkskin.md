> "***Pinkskin***" is a derogatory term for non-[[Orc|orcs]] by those of orc blood.  The colloquialism refers to the fact that [[Humans|humans]] and other demi-humans have a pinkish hue to their skin, rather than the green or grey tones of orc-kind.  While the term generally refers to humans and [[Elves|elves]], in places where [[Half-orcs|half-orcs]] are looked down upon by full-blooded orcs, they can be grouped into this term as well.  Pinkskin is also the name of the human district of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] orc settlement, [[Urglin]].
