> The **Gray Garrison** is a museum located in the [[Old Kenabres]] district of the city of [[Kenabres]] in [[Mendev]]. The building is squat and plain, and is completely windowless. The museum gained its name due to its plain gray stone faÃ§ade.
> The museum contains numerous relics from the [[Mendevian Crusades]] as well as an aerie and a shrine to [[Iomedae]]. The whole building is tended by several aged curators.
