> **New Calignos** is a district of [[Pangolais]], located southwest of the city proper. It is inhabited mostly by [[Caligni|caligni]], who try to replicate how Calignos, their ancestral home during the [[Age of Legend]] that they have never seen, would have looked like.
> The architecture of New Calignos is distinctive from the rest of Pangolais, in part due to swooping rooflines and ornately tiled walkways. Purple-hearted white star of Azlant flowers fill window boxes and tumble from plinths at street crossings, creating a subtle fragrance that deeply ingrains itself in the minds of those that grow up here. Every bakery sells leaf-shaped cakes filled with torani nut paste, and every family has a recipe for the duvai, savoury steamed dumplings that grandmothers serve to their grandchildren each birthday.
> It is dubious that New Calignos' traditions are authentic to the original Calignos: caligni scholars spend lifetimes searching historical records for bits of information about their ancestors, but the ancient [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] were a diverse people, and New Calignos' culture is not a recreation of how the actual people of Calignos once lived, but was artificially cobbled together from what little scholars know about numerous different Azlanti sub-cultures. Nevertheless, these traditions have been deeply rooted in the minds of the many generations of caligni that grew up with duvai dumplings and nut-paste cakes in New Calignos.
