> The **Grand Vault** is an enormous hall within [[Azlanti Keep]] that serves as the final defense of the city of [[Absalom]] in case its walls and keeps are ever breached. The [[First Guard]], Absalom's primary defense force, holds its assemblies in the room under the standards of the countless armies that have failed to breach the keep. The immense Grand Vault could once accomodate Absalom's entire population in times of siege (as it did during the [[First Siege of Absalom|First Siege]] of [[23 AR]]), but it outgrew this capacity long ago.
> The Grand Vault also houses immense stone tablets upon which are written [[Aroden|Arodens]] [[First Laws of Absalom]], which formed the foundation of the city's governmental structure.
