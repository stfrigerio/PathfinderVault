> **Ghost mold** is a [[Fungus|fungus]] found in areas of strong [[Necromancy|necromantic]] activity in the [[Darklands]]. It appears as faintly glowing black dust, hard to spot even for those who have encountered it before. It reacts by briefly glowing a pale white if living creatures come within arm's reach, throwing out a cloud of spores in a ten-foot radius. These spores attack both the mind—potentially causing fearsome hallucinations of death—and the body, draining away life energy.
> The body of a creature completely drained of life energy becomes a new patch of ghost mold. The victim's spirit may briefly remain to haunt the area as a [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]], until it too is destroyed by the feeding of the ghost mold.
