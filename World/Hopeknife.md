> The presentation of a **hopeknife** as a child enters adulthood is an important life event for the citizens of [[Trunau]].


## History and Use

> Children of Trunau are presented with a hopeknife on their twelfth birthday and shown precisely which arteries to cut to kill themselves should they or their families be taken alive by the [[Orc|orc]] hordes. They are taught that a swift death is better than being eaten alive, tortured, or being forced into [[Slavery|slavery]] by the orcs. The hopeknife is associated with the Standing Vow made by all Trunauans to defend the town even to the point of sacrificing one's own life.


## Description

> A hopeknife is a small, sheathed [[Dagger|dagger]], often of masterwork quality, usually secreted away under clothes and attached to a chain.
