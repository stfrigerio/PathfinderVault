> The **March of Madness** is the only one major tunnel that runs through [[Reguare]], an isolated expanse of [[Nar-Voth]] that lies beneath the ancient holdings of [[Ghol-Gan]] empire. Much shorter than the [[Long Walk]], the March of Madness features halls of cyclopean size and its caverns tower hundreds feet high, obviously home to colossal creatures. Strange inscriptions on the walls sometimes span from floor to ceiling. Scholar say that the [[Cyclops|cyclopes]] of Ghol-Gan captured and tamed [[Purple worm|purple worms]] or other slithering behemoths to use as mounts in their wars against the [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]], and the March of Madness served as a valuable passageway for Ghol-Gan cavalry on their campaigns.
