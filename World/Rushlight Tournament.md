> The annual **Rushlight Tournament**, hosted by [[Castruccio Irovetti|King Castruccio Irovetti]] of [[Pitax]] since [[4705 AR]], draws champions from across the [[River Kingdoms]] to a festival ground northeast of Pitax on the banks of Cutter's Creek, a tributary of the Rushlight River. The six-day festival is held from the first [[Fireday]] of [[Sarenith]] through the final day's Midnight Joust.
> Save for the Midnight Joust, contests begin an hour before noon on each day. Each contest has its own rules, but all share three common rules: no contestant can harm a spectator, kill a competitor, or be caught cheating. Violators of these rules are disqualified from that event. Past contests have included longbow competitions, axe-wielding tests of strength, boasting contests, and drunken jousts.
