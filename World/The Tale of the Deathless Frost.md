 The demonic rune of [[Kostchtchie]].
> The unholy text of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Kostchtchie]] is called ***The Tale of the Deathless Frost***. It is usually written in spiralling [[Rune|runes]] on stone, making it very heavy; to overcome this problem, the short stories are often learnt and told orally. It contains a history of Kostchtchie's ascent to [[Immortal|immortal]] power, where the story of [[Baba Yaga]] is twisted from the truth. It also contains his three commandments to his faithful:

> - Avenge Yourself Times Three
> - Bow to No Woman
> - Kill All Witches
