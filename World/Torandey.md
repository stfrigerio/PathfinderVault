> **Torandey** was a great [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] city in [[Cyrusian]] on the ruins of which, today, is built the city of [[Jol]], the capital of the Kingdom of [[Southmoor]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. After the fall of Thassilon, the city was controlled by [[Giant|giants]] who succeeded in defending it from powerful attacks by Rolf Redhand in -502 AR and King [[Ulvass]] in -446 AR. It was not until [[1102 AR]] that King [[Eskir Honeytongue]] founded Jol on the ruins.
