 [[Bard's End|Bards]] draw upon occult magic from esoteric knowledge.
> **Occult magic** is one of four [[Magical tradition|traditions]] of [[Magic|magic]], along with [[Divine|divine]], [[Arcane|arcane]] and [[Primal magic|primal magic]], that manifests in the form of [[Spell|spells]] and spell-like effects. Occult magic is rooted in esoteric and alien knowledge of the [[Multiverse|multiverses]] mysteries. The practitioners of occult traditions seek to understand the unexplainable, categorize the bizarre, and otherwise access the ephemeral in a systematic way.

### On Golarion

> Occult magic is the most misunderstood of the four types of magic. Because of its association with the eldritch, the aberrant, and the unknown, it is seen as creepy and rarely discussed openly, leading to even more disinformation among the general population of [[Golarion]]. While most misconceptions of occult magic are harmful to its practitioners, some are quite amusing. For example, even educated individuals often believe that [[Bard's End|bards]] use some sort of [[Arcane|arcane]] magic, as the scary and mysterious occult magic could not possibly be wielded by someone who plays cheery music and has such an energetic attitude.
> Occult magic is a component of some [[Mualijae]], [[Ilverani]], and [[Vourinoi]] magic, often in the forms of thought-reading and [[Telepathy|telepathy]].
> [[Cheliax]], [[Druma]], and [[Ustalav]] are nexuses of occult activity in the [[Inner Sea region]], which also makes them hotbeds of occult magic. The [[Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye]] specializes in occult studies, and [[Kelesh]] incorporates occult calculations into its imperial rule.
> The [[Pathfinder Society|Pathfinder Societys]] quest for knowledge is often compatible with occult studies, including occult magic.
> The *[[PathfinderWiki/Items/Artifacts/Minor Artifacts/Final blade|final blades]]* of [[Galt]] are inherently infused with occult magic.


### Practitioners

> [[Bard's End|Bards]], some [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]], some [[Witch|witches]], some [[Summoner|summoners]], and [[Psychic|psychics]] all cast occult spells.
> Occult magic often attracts diviners, hermits, and scholars. Fell gnomes are also drawn to occult magic.
