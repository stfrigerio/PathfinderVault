 A [[Magus|magus]] emulates a Jistkan artificer.
> During the middle-period of the [[Jistka Imperium]], the **artificers** were one of the two factions struggling for power. They concentrated on the manufacture of [[Golem|golems]] and other powerful war machines. As the Jistka Imperium expanded, the artificers built the majority of their golemwork factories in the Jistkan territories of southern [[Avistan]] while their rival faction, the [[Jistkan magistrates|magistrates]], established their most prominent holdings in northern [[Garund]].


## Jistka's artificer caste

> The artificers were organized into the **artificer caste system**, with each caste holding different levels of influence and importance. Their caste system included:

> - the **worker-artificers**, who made up the lowest class of miners, forgers, and other laborers
> - the **priest-artificers** who were revered for their connections to the [[Outer Planes]] and their prowess with [[Divine magic|divine magic]]
> - the **judge-artificers** who commanded the legions of golem soldiers that served as northern Jistka's armies, using the Imperium's legendary *[[Ivory baton|ivory batons]]*
> Priest-artificers used to bless especially powerful golems at great **temple-forges** with powers granted by their mysterious gods.


## Jistka's golems

> Artificers' [[Automaton|automatons]] and inventions were incorporated in Jistka's society. Their uses varied from miniature mechanical actors for audiences' amusement, to imperial automaton troops and black-masked executioners. The most impressive of Jistka's golems were the colossal [[Behemoth golem|behemoth golems]]. The priest-artificers infused these [[Elephant|elephantine]] goliaths with [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiend]]-tainted compounds and fueled them with the spirits of [[Daemon|daemons]], [[Devil|devils]], and [[Demon|demons]]. Their unholy, incredible power provided the generals of the Jistka Imperium with the additional power they needed to confront the [[Div|divs]] and [[Necromancy|necromantic]] [[Elemental|elemental]] [[Outsider|outsiders]] of [[Osirion|Ancient Osirion]].
