 An ogre hook item card.
> Nothing more than a large, sharpened metal hook, the **ogre hook** is commonly a large weapon, making it uncomfortable for [[Human|human-sized]] people to use. They are normally created by [[Giant|giants]] and their kin, so this doesn't worry the smiths creating them.
> They are most commonly used by [[Ogre|ogres]], hence the name. The [[Beast of Lepidstadt]] is also known to wield an ogre hook.
