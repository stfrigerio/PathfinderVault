> **Thyst** is a highly [[Radiation|irradiated]] [[Moon|moon]] of the [[Planet|planet]] [[Bretheda]].


## Geography

> Thyst's atmosphere is highly radioactive, enough to quickly melt most visitors into residue, and covered in thick clouds that shroud most of the surface in perpetual twilight.


## Inhabitants

> Thyst has developed an ecosystem that lives off the intense radiation that would kill many other lifeforms. This includes tree ferns with black leaves and 20-foot-tall grasses, and bald, thin [[Feline|felines]] that prey upon the burrowing locust-voles. Texts written by Thyst's neighbours suggest that its resident sapient life forms are a light-absorbing [[Humanoid|humanoid]] race with unnaturally inorganic-looking skin (which might or might not be a type of clothing), but very few have managed to contact them, and most visits only report of countless eyes glowing in the grass forests.
