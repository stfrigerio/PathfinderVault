> **Ganderhal's Lair** is an underground vault on the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] side of the [[Menador Mountains]], where the mountains form the border between Cheliax and [[Nidal]]. The lair is north of the [[Doracium River]] and south of the Nidalese settlement of [[Ridwan]].


## History

> The lair's namesake, [[Ganderhal]], was a powerful aristocratic [[Shadowcaster|shadowcaster]] in centuries past. He and his rival Zonotha were both trained at Nidal's [[Dusk Hall]] and founded lairs in the Menador Mountains for their experiments with [[Shadow magic|shadow magic]] and immortality through [[Undeath|undeath]] and [[Lich|lichdom]].
> Between the two, Ganderhal failed: Zonotha achieved lichdom first and killed Ganderhal before he could complete his ritual. The [[Wizard|wizard]] instead rose as a [[Shadow|shadow]] to seek his revenge, and refashioned his lair into a labyrinthine trap filled with [[Undead|undead]] creations while compiling an extensive library of information on liches. Nearby worshipers of [[Iomedae]] and [[Sarenrae]] in [[Andoran]] grow increasingly concerned about Ganderhal's power.
