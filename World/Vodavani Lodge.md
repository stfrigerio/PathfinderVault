> Many [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] from across the [[Inner Sea region]] who arrive at the **Vodavani Lodge**, sometimes called the **Havenguard Asylum**, in [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]] proceed to explore the various sites of interest in [[Ustalav]], including:

> - the [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]]-haunted wasteland called [[The Furrows|the Furrows]]
> - the sites associated with the [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|lich]] king [[Tar-Baphon|Tar-Baphon the Whispering Tyrant]], like his prison-fortress at [[Gallowspire]]
> - the [[Hundred Haunted Vales]] of the [[Hungry Mountains]]

> The Lodge also serves as a mental health treatment facility.


## Venture-captain

> [[Beaurigmand Trice|Dr Beaurigmand Trice]] acts as the chief [[Heal|healer]] of the Asylum. He used to be the [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] for the lodge, but the wake of [[Tar-Baphon]]'s assault on [[Avistan]] in [[4719 AR]], his healing services are in such demand that he has given over management of the lodge to Venture-Captain [[Evni Zongnoss]] whose Pathfinder lodge in [[Vigil]], [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] was destroyed by the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]].
> Dr. Trice firmly believes that people hold within them the power to heal themselves and others without relying on the power of [[Divine magic|divine magic]]. Dr. Trice, over the course of his career, has come to focus on maladies of the mind, helped by his assistant [[Cereis Linas]].
