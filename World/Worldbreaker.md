## History

> The Fifth Army of Exploration first used the *Worldbreaker* between [[2009 AR|2009]] and [[2014 AR]] to pacify what would later become the [[River Kingdoms]] and [[Brevoy]], advancing all the way to the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]] before turning back. After the end of the war, the siege engine was placed on [[Worldbreaker Hill]] in [[Oppara]] to guard the western river approach to the city.Cite error: Invalid <ref> tag; invalid names, e.g. too many
> Seventy years later, the Sixth Army of Exploration pulled the *Worldbreaker* from its foundation in Oppara and dragged it across the continent of [[Garund]]. It was captured by the forces of the [[Gorilla King]] in [[2089 AR]] in the [[Battle of Nagisa]], and is now said to hang in the treasure hall of the [[Silverback King]] of [[Usaro]].
