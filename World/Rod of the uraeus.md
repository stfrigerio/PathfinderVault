> The **rod of the uraeus** is constructed in the form of the two-headed, winged spitting cobra. This creature is the [[Uraeus|uraeus]], the symbol of the benevolent serpent [[Wadjet]] that is the guardian of the [[River Sphinx]] and the ruler of [[Osirion]]. While any wielder can use it as an magical light mace, one who is devoted to law and order is especially nimble and gains insight into the motives of others. Such a wielder can use the rod to summon a cloud of stinging poison that can sicken and stun his opponents.
