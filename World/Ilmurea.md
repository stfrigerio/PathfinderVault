> **Ilmurea** is a lost subterranean city that was once home to the [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]] [[Deity|god]] [[Ydersius]] during the [[Age of Legend]].


## Geography

> By serpentfolk standards, Ilmurea was a small settlement. However, despite having been badly damaged by both the [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] and [[Earthfall]], Ilmurea still exudes the serpentfolk's ancient power. Its buildings, far beyond the scope of [[Human|human]] [[Engineering|engineering]], are scarred but still intact, as are the waterfalls that continue to irrigate it and the serpentstone sculptures that yet exude strange incenses, sounds, and lights.


## History

> Ilmurea was hastily built as a small, emergency military base by the serpentfolk of [[Sverenagati]] during the twilight years of their empire, as their war against the Azlanti took greater and greater tolls on them. From this last redoubt, the serpentfolk sought to reclaim what they lost on the surface, but all their plans were ruined when Ydersius was beheaded by the Azlanti heroine [[Savith]]. Repeated Azlanti raids eventually forced the serpentfolk to abandon the city and retreat to deeper enclaves. For untold years, the Azlanti garrison looted Ilmurea until Earthfall came and cut them off from supply, causing them to gradually evolve into [[Morlock|morlocks]].
