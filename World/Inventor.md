> Any tinkerer can craft using a formula, but the inventor is an innovator, creating what was considered impossible and pushing the boundaries of reality. An inventor is always on the cusp of making the next breakthrough in science and technology, and every setback presents another opportunity to fine-tune their contraptions.



## Innovation

> While inventors are always working on something new, they all have an 'innovation' - their preeminent work, that, after a bit of refinement, will hopefully change the world. It may be a cutting-edge suit of customized armor with a variety of attachments; a mechanical construct with various modifications; an impressive (an unusual) custom weapon augmented by numerous mechanisms; or even something barely held together by an inventor's ingenuity and pure hope, always ready to fall apart because of the complex and powerful functions it was made to perform.
> Many inventorsâ€™ creations seem to defy reality, made possible by their creators' constant study and search for the hidden laws of reality. Inventors believe the world has its own set of mostly undiscovered laws, like what makes electricity follow a certain path.
> Exactly what these laws are and how they should be explained is a matter of debate. To safeguard their trade, status, secrets, and revenue, many inventors hide their findings behind bizarre symbols and secret codes. However, there are more open-minded individuals who believe that sharing their findings and letting peers evaluate their works can help others. While these societies are small and isolated, most of their members think that they and others like them are on the right course toward solving the mysteries of the multiverse. While academic spellcasters appreciate their rigor, they believe the separating the laws of mundane reality from magic is an unnecessary and needless constraint, considering that magical essences are an important part of the fundamental fabric of reality. For their part, naturalists believe these spellcasters are missing the point.
