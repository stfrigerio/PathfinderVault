 A depiction of Pharasma.
> **Pharasma's Palace**, located at the center of the [[Boneyard]] is a soaring building of white marble and gothic architecture. The gleaming white structure shines with an inner light, representing [[Pharasma]]'s domain as the [[Deity|goddess]] of birth, while the onyx-black floors represent her domain as the goddess of death. This glorious palace is where the Lady of Graves herself resides, as well as the [[Soul|souls]] of her worshipers. It is also where the most difficult of adjudications, those of souls under contract (usually [[Hell|infernal]] in nature) who regretted the pact and took significant steps toward redemption and another [[Alignment|alignment]], are resolved by the goddess herself. Such cases often involve the parties' most powerful representatives available.
> The palace is where souls that died under mysterious circumstances can make a request to take care of unfinished business, including sending short messages to a loved one or haunting one's enemies. Determined living [[Mortal|mortals]] might also traverse the long and difficult path to secure a meeting with Pharasma, where they can petition the goddess for answers or favors that only she or [[Psychopomp|her servants]] can provide.
