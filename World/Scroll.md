*This article covers the [[Magic|magical]] document. "Scroll" can also refer to a [[httpsenwikipediaorgScroll|non-magical document on a roll of paper]].*
> A **scroll** is a [[Magic|magical]] document on which a [[Spell|spell]], or a number of spells, has been written in a special way. Unlike a spell written in a [[Spellbook|spellbook]], a spell scribed on a scroll is released when read by a proficient spellcaster, almost as though she had cast it herself. The spell is erased from the scroll when it is read.



## Appearance

> A scroll is always written on an expensive and heavy surface, such as vellum or fine paper; they are reinforced with leather boundaries for protection, or even metal rods for larger scrolls. Scrolls are usually 8â€“9 inches wide and about one foot long per spell written on them. Scrolls are often rolled from both ends to create a double tube for easier unfurling when they are needed for casting.


## Storage

> Scrolls are often needed quickly, perhaps to save a life or during combat so their storage and ease of access has to be balanced with protecting a vulnerable asset. A **scroll tube**, or **scroll case**, is often used to protect scrolls from, for instance, damage by water or spell effects. Such scroll tubes may be plain or more ornate made from ivory, jade or metal, rather than mere wood or leather. Some casters will use magic sigils to denote the contents of a scroll tube. More paranoid or cautious magic users may even entrap their scroll tubes to avoid them being stolen or misused.
