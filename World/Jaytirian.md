> The city of **Jaytirian** in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] was once home to the humanoid bat-folk known as the [[Sabosan|sabosan]]. They defended it against attacks from the [[Spawn of Angazhan]].
> However, several hundred years ago an unknown disaster forced the sabosan to abandon the city. Other sources state that a siege by the [[Gorilla King]]'s forces took so much from the sabosan, that the few survivors had to leave their home and take on a roaming lifestyle.
> Centuries later, the ruins of Jaytirian were explored by [[Donatalus Bisby]], following sponsorship by the Pathfinder [[Decemvirate]]. Only two men survived the expedition (including Bisby) though they were rumored to have returned with an exotic relic.
