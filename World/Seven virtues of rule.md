> The **seven virtues of rule** are the ideals of wise governance first articulated by [[Xin|Emperor Xin]] of the ancient realm of [[Thassilon]] in what is today [[Varisia]]. They include charity, generosity, humility, kindness, love, temperance, and zeal, and were developed from the teachings of the goddess [[Lissala]]. Xin believed that the seven virtues were rewards given to righteous and wise rulers. The seven virtues eventually became corrupted under the successors of Emperor Xin, the [[Runelords|runelords]], and were transformed into the seven vices: greed, lust, pride, gluttony, envy, wrath, and sloth. Both the virtues and the sins of rule are represented by the seven-pointed star of Thassilon, the [[Sihedron Rune]].
