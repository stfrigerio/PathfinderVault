 A map of the [[River of Souls]], which depicts the various paths a mortal [[Soul|soul]] takes from its creation to its death.
> Most life on the [[Material Plane]], including [[Golarion]], experiences **mortality**, wherein the creature's life has a definite beginning and ending linked to the points in time when its [[Soul|soul]] is joined to and released from a vessel. Any entity that has a soul but has not yet been judged by [[Pharasma]] in the [[Boneyard]] is considered mortal.
> Individual creatures who experience mortality are known as **mortals**, as opposed to those who do not, who are often known as **immortals**. However, immortality is not simply the absence of mortality—perpetually living mortals still receive judgment from Pharasma at the ends of their lives.
