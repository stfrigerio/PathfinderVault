> ***Gug hide*** is a suit of [[Armour|armour]] stitched together from the hide of [[Gug|gugs]] from the [[Dreamlands]] and [[Leng]]. The wearer of *gug hide* can infuse the menace of Leng into their actions in an underground environment, and, if they have two arms or fewer, can split them into two arms at the elbow, each ending in a furred hand like that of a gug. This ability lasts for ten minutes and can only be used once per day.
