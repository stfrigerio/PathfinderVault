> The **Seven Dragon Bridge** is an impressive bridge in the [[Tian Xia]] city-state of [[Goka]] stretching from the city to the [[Island of Endless Fortunes]] with its many famous casinos. The Seven Dragon Bridge is renowned for its graceful spires and was built soon after Goka's founding. [[Xhai Xen Xiao]], the city's founder, fell to his death from the Seven Dragon Bridge in [[329 AR]]; rumour has it that a yellow-robed member of the [[Yixing]] precursor to the [[Butterfly Blades]] was somehow involved in this.
