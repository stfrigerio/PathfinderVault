> **Miratanza**, also known as the **Floating Market**, is located in the [[City districts of Westcrown|Rego Laina]] in [[Westcrown]]. It is the only area open to transactions and commerce on Westcrown Island or the [[City districts of Westcrown|Parego Regicona]]. It allows servants for the inhabitants of [[City districts of Westcrown|Regicona]] to shop for goods without visiting the mainland. Vendors can rent space or simply sell from ships tied up at the market.
> The public murder of Lileia Ruel on the market's edge in [[Pharast]] of [[4575 AR]], during the [[White Plague]], inspired her widower [[Daidian Ruel]] to form a vigilante force to hunt down the [[Path of Grace]] cult implicated in her death. Daidian Ruel and his group would go on to found the [[Order of the Rack]], the first [[Hellknights]] order, during this quest for vengeance.
