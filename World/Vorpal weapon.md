> A **vorpal weapon** is a [[Mechanics/Spells/Spells/Level 1/Magic Weapon|magic]] [[CategorySlashing weapons|slashing weapon]] imbued with the power to cleave a target's head from its shoulders when the wielder scores a particularly accurate hit, causing instant death. Creatures with no discernible heads and most [[Mindless undead|mindless undead]] are unaffected by this, however.
> It is said that vorpal weapons were originally created as a means of killing [[Jabberwock|jabberwocks]]; in any event, the beasts have a healthy fear of such [[Weapon|weapons]].
> The vorpal quality is arguably the most powerful ability a weapon can have. It is certainly the most difficult and time-consuming to create of all the weapon enhancements. As a result, such items are extremely rare, and anyone who owns one should be treated with caution.


## On Golarion

> Attitudes toward vorpal weapons vary. [[Elf|Elves]] claim to find them inelegant, while the random nature of the beheadings is often of interest to [[Gnome|gnomes]]. There have never been any reports of [[Goblin|goblins]] wielding vorpal [[Dogslicer|dogslicers]], but that is presumably due to a lack of magical talent rather than any moral scruples on the part of the goblins.
> The [[Aldori swordlord|Aldori swordlords]] do not allow their use in duels, and the [[Eagle Knight|Eagle Knights]] of [[Andoran]] use them only as a last resort. However, worshippers of [[Sarenrae]] praise them as the most merciful of weapons; indeed the most legendary of the [[Qadira|Qadiran]] dervishes are said to use fiery, razor-sharp [[Scimitar|scimitars]] with the vorpal quality. 
> In the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], those who slay a [[Linnorm|linnorm]] demonstrate their worthiness to rule. Sometimes, this feat is achieved with the aid of a vorpal weapon. A few of the [[Ulfen]] are starting to regard this use of vorpal weapons as cheating.
> Priests of [[Urgathoa]] use vorpal scythes in a [[Ritual|ritual]] known as the [[Reaping]]. Followers of [[Gorum]] view vorpal [[Greatsword|greatswords]] as holy relics, and often seek to recover those in the possession of heretics.
