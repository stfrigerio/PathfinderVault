> The **Palace of Ivory and Bone** is a perverse, desecrated fortress within the holy lands of the [[Divine Garden]] region of eastern [[Vudra]]. The palace was built in [[4465 AR]] by the [[Rajput Shivji Shashibhushan|Vile Prince Rajput Shivji Shashibhushan]] who desecrated and stole from the holy [[Elephant|elephant]] graveyard of the [[Ajitesh Valley]]. Using these vast skeletal reserves, the Vile Prince created an [[Undead|undead]] workforce of [[Rajput ambari|rajput ambari]] to drag these materials to his new fortress. The Palace of Ivory and Bone is a vast, towering structure built mainly of stolen elephant bone and ivory. The Vile Prince was defeated centuries ago but still the palace stands and rumour says it is still haunted by the [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]] of the Vile Prince to this day.
