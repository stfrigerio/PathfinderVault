> The **Parchlands** is an exceptionally dry desert located in [[Casmaron]], south of the [[Whistling Plains]]. Several groups of nomads skirt its perimeter but avoid the interior, due to powerful taboos and fear of the resident territorial [[Girtablilu|girtablilus]] and [[Ash giant|ash giants]]. The only settlement within the Parchlands is [[Curse|accursed]] and abandoned Neruzavin, originally built by the [[Flying polyp|flying polyps]], located approximately 230 miles from its northwestern corner.
