> **The Hungry Sepulcher** is the uncompleted tomb of the [[Pharaoh|pharaoh]], [[Kemusar I]]. It appears randomly along the banks of the [[River Sphinx]]. Every time the Hungry Sepulcher appears, it mysteriously coincides with a mysterious death, usually of a descendant of Kemusar's court. Some scholars believe there is a pattern to the location of the appearances and hope to glean enough information to be present when it next appears, either to loot the tomb or to search the sepulcher for a possible greater treasure.
