> A **teleportation mishap** is sometimes the result of a failed or disrupted [[Teleportation|teleportation]] attempt. The most common result is a painful injury, but mishaps can also lead to unexpected destinations for those being teleported.


## Causes

> [[Magic|Magical]] teleportation also often requires the [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]] to at least be familiar with the destination in order to teleport to it. Attempts to teleport to an unfamiliar or invented target have a higher chance of resulting in a teleportation mishap.


## Effects
