> The **Green Faith** (also known as the **Old Faith**, the **Great Eld**, or the **Wyrd**) is a naturalistic [[Philosophy|philosophy]] based on the belief that natural forces are worthy of attention and respect. Followers of the Green Faith meditate daily, commune with natural forms of power, and show respect to nature in all things. They often hang fresh herbs from the lintels of doorways as a sign of respect for nature. Although the Green Faith is based on nature, one need not be a [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] to value its tenets, nor do all druids necessarily count themselves as members of this philosophy, although almost all of them appreciate its values.



## History

> The Green Faith is one of the oldest forms of worship in Golarion, as evidenced by the numerous druidic symbols found in the cave drawings of early man. According to legend, in the earliest years of its existence, the Green Faith was split into four factions. One group venerated the strength and endurance of stone, another the power and ferocity of wild beasts, a third the bountiful earth, and the last, the cleansing purity of fire. For years, these four factions fought for supremacy, each claiming that the aspect of nature it venerated was the most important. Finally, the leaders of the four factions agreed to resolve their conflict through single combat. Before the battle could begin, however, a multicolored geyser sprang from the ground, equal parts water, earth, and flame. The geyser was followed by an enormous flock of multicolored birds, which flew off in all directions. The faction leaders saw this as a clear sign from nature that no one element could be more important than another, and that ultimately, the four factions shared the same basic philosophy.


## Moot of Ages

> The [[Moot of Ages]] is an annual meeting held on the summer solstice, hosted on the [[Isle of Arenway]] by the druids of the [[Wildwood Lodge]]. The Isle is located within the [[Verduran Forest]] of [[Taldor]], at the confluence of the [[Sellen River|Sellen]] and [[Verduran Fork|Verduran Fork rivers]]. Druids from all over [[Golarion]] travel there to present their findings to the assembled Green Faith community. Conclusions are generally not reached through logic and the enforcing of dogma, but rather by listening for and interpreting the [[Will of the World]], the collective intelligence of nature itself.


## Holidays

> The worshipers of the Green Faith do not need calendars, which are just constructs of civilization. The markers they use are the changing of seasons. As a result, the Green Faith mainly celebrates, with simple rituals, the equinoxes and solstices.


## Holy text

> The Green Faith writes its texts solely on stone and does not use paper. These texts are complicated and one usually needs to read on multiple stones to understand a single document, which helps protecting the faith's secrets from infidels. For the same reason, the Green Faith has a strong oral tradition, and initiates of the faith need to be able to remember large amounts of information. High-ranking members sometimes compile their thoughts on the Green Faith's teachings into songs or speeches.


## Relationships

> Followers of the Green Faith are generally on good terms with those who worship [[Golarion|Golarions]] nature [[Deity|deities]] such as [[Erastil]], [[Gozreh]], and the [[Eldest]]. The Green Faith is hostile to religions that corrupt or shackle nature (such as the cults of [[Demon lord|demon lords]], [[Urgathoa]], [[Rovagug]], [[Nethys]], *etc.*)


## On Golarion

> On [[Golarion]], the Green Faith is centred in [[Andoran]], [[Nirmathas]], [[Taldor]], and the [[River Kingdoms]]. [[Sarkoris]], prior to its destruction at the hands of [[Demon|demons]], was formerly the Green Faith's greatest bastion; since then, Green Faith holdouts continue their fight to protect nature from the corruption of the [[Worldwound]]. [[Human|Humans]], [[Elf|elves]], and [[Half-elf|half-elves]] make up the majority of the Green Faith's members.
