> The **Hearth-Grown House** is the "[[Divine realm|divine realm]]" of the [[Halfling|halfling]] [[God|goddess]] [[Chaldira Zuzaristan]], and is unusually located within the divine realm of another deity: [[Abadar|Abadars]] city of [[Aktun]] on the [[Plane|plane]] of [[Axis]]. The reason that "divine realm" is in quotes, is because the Hearth-Grown House is much smaller than the standard divine realm of a goddess. It is merely a rambling set of apartments, feasting halls, and countless inns and taverns located in and around several of Akitun's more well-known buildings. The House's location also allows the goddess to keep a close watch on her main rival, [[Thamir Gixx]], who resides in the back alleys of Axis. The Hearth-Grown House serves as a refuge not only for Chaldira, but also for like-minded friends and allies who live or visit Aktun and yearn for relief from the Eternal City's unchanging perfection. Abadar in turn tolerates the disorder and gambling that tends to take place in the House, seeing at a necessary evil that allows the city's inhabitants to blow off steam while stimulating the economy.
