> **The Palms** is one of the two easternmost of the sixteen city districts of [[Sothis]] along with [[Peacock Square]]. The latter district lies to the south of the Palms, and the similarly rich [[Grand Oasis]] district. To the west lies the [[Rose Quarter]], known for its illicit trading. 
> Like the other rich, peripheral suburbs, the Palms contains large oasis circles; wide, tree-lined streets; and excellent facilities for its inhabitants. These residents include wealthy merchants and craftsmen, civil servants, and nobles dwelling in their mansions.
