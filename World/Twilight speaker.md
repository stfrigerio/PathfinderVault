> **Twilight speakers** are traveling religious envoys of [[Ilverani]] [[Elf|elf]] tribes. Due to the Snowcasters' insular society, twilight speakers who are viewed as being corrupted by the outside world—including those who mate with [[Human|humans]] and parent [[Snowcaster half-elf]] children—are exiled from their tribes.
