 [[Lisette Demonde]] carries a rifle across her shoulders.*See also [[CategoryImages of rifles]].*
> An excellent long-range [[Firearm|firearm]], the **rifle** fires small-caliber bullets at a high velocity through a grooved barrel (or "rifled" barrel, thus its name) that spins the bullet for greater accuracy. This makes it the firearm of choice for snipers. The length of the barrel requires two hands to aim properly.



## Variants

> The rifle is an evolution of the [[Musket|musket]].
> The double-length double hackbut is mounted to a lightweight carriage for highly accurate, stable firing from a fixed, but portable, position.
> The pepperbox rifle has a rotatable set of four barrels for rapid firing.
> A [[Wand rifle|wand rifle]], while not a firearm, borrows the rifle's form to more accurately aim [[Magic item|magical]] [[Wand|wands]].

> Rifles are among [[Golarion]]'s most advanced and expensive firearms, with base models costing between 3,000 and 5,000 [[Gold piece|gold pieces]]. Most weigh about 12 pounds and load ammunition via metal cartridges, though the cylinder rifle is loaded through a rotating eight-chambered horizontal disk. Rare rifles have barrels crafted from special materials, such as [[Mithral|mithral]].
> To combat the threat of [[Spellscar fext|Spellscar fexts]], gunsmiths in Alkenstar craft special glass bullets for rifles.


### In culture

> On the [[Technology|technologically]] advanced [[Planet|planet]] of [[Earth]], more sophisticated rifles like the bolt-action M1891 are capable of even more devastating effects at longer ranges.
> Several [[Beam weapon|beam weapons]] and other technological rifles from [[Androffa]]—including the arc rifle, EMP rifle, gravity rifle, hypersonic rifle, [[Nanite|nanite]]-firing id rifle, laser rifle, sonic rifle, and zero rifle—have a similar-enough shape and triggering method as rifles to be intuitively used by more primitive cultures—including people of [[Golarion]] who encounter remnants in [[Numeria]]. These weapons are sometimes also installed on or integrated into Androffan [[Robot|robots]].
> The [[Shobhad|shobhad]] of [[Akiton]] wield longrifles that take advantage of the world's relatively low [[Gravity|gravity]] to fire with great accuracy from long range.
> Radium rifles, and the larger variant Thark rifles, of Barsoom fire radium cartridges that explode upon impact, but only when exposed to sunlight.
