> The **Rabid Dog** is a tall, ramshackle tavern that sits amidst warehouses and mining offices east of the road through the [[Dawn Gate]] in [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]]. Its owner is an old [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]] named [[Moss Pelt]] who caters to gnoll visitors and locals. The food served is distinctly "gnollish" in nature. The Rabid Dog is a dangerous place to frequent but it is said that a gnoll named Shank Whitelock who spends much of his time in the Rabid Dog, is one of the greatest
guides in the city. For a fee of 5 gp per day Shank can guide his clients to just about anywhere they want to go from Katapesh all the way to Solku.
