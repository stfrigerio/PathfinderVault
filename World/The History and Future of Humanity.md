> ***The History and Future of Humanity*** is the god [[Aroden|Arodens]] holy text. Since the death of Aroden and the demise of his faith, the text may now be found in some churches of [[Iomedae]]; presumably the best places for finding it being in those churches of the Inheritor that were once Aroden's temples. It may also be found in private collections.

## The Pilgrim's Cave

> Passages of this sacred text, along with numerous carvings depicting the twelve guises of Aroden, are carved into the [[Pilgrim's Cave|Pilgrims Cave]], a large cavern in the foothills of the [[Kortos Mounts]]. The carvings are thought to be centuries old, yet still contain a faint echo of the dead god's power.
