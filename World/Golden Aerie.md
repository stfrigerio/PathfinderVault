> The **Golden Aerie** is the headquarters of the [[Eagle Knight|Eagle Knights]] of [[Andoran]], and is located at the center of the [[Field of Concord]] in the [[Liberty District]] of the capital city of [[Almas]].


## History

> The Aerie, officially known as the **Guardian Tower of the Golden Aerie**, is a massive column-shaped fortress, said to have once been part of a much larger, ancient ruin that was brought to Almas stone by stone from abroad. In the mid [[Absalom Reckoning|46th century AR]], all of the pieces were reassembled into a massive seven-story column, which was crowned with a 15-foot tall golden statue of [[Talmandor]], the patron [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] of Andoran. The original location of the column, and how it was discovered, remain a mystery, but most-likely it has something to do with the legendary [[Avoral|avoral]] [[Agathion|agathion]]. The original ruin is also rumored to have been connected to an ancient center of agathion influence.
