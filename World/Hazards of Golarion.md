 [[Blightburn]], a naturally hazardous [[Radioactive|radioactive]] material.
> A number of hazardous substances of various types can be found in [[Golarion]], especially in the [[Darklands]].



## Brown mold

> Brown mold [[Fungus|fungus]] draws heat from everything in a five-foot radius, and noticeably lowers the temperature in a 30-foot radius. If it comes into contact with a strong source of heat such as fire, the brown mold instantly doubles in size. It is vulnerable to extreme cold temperatures.
> Brown mold spores are used to create a pale blue poison known as [[Poisons of GolarionPoisons Acting through Ingestion|frostspore]], which injures its target with intense cold.


## Cytillesh

***Main article: [[Cytillesh]]***
> Cytillesh is also known as brain mold. It gives off a bright blue glow equivalent to torchlight and is prized by [[Dero|deros]], who appreciate its benefits and are not fazed by its severe detriments. Thus it can often be found growing on the walls and ceilings of dero communities.
> Prolonged exposure to cytillesh can slow ageing by half. Derro also believe it provides mental enhancement and is responsible for creating the exceptional dero they refer to savants. It also causes stillbirths, birth defects and insanity, which the dero view as minor drawbacks.
> Derros also use [[Poisons of GolarionPoisons Acting through Ingestion|cytillesh extract]] as a poison.


## Ghost mold

***Main article: [[Ghost mold]]***
> Ghost mold is found in areas of strong [[Necromancy|necromantic]] activity. It is a faintly glowing black dust and hard to spot even for those who have encountered it before.
> It reacts if living creatures approach within five feet, throwing out a cloud of spores in a 10-foot radius. These spores attack both the mindâ€“potentially causing fearsome hallucinations of death-and the body, draining away life energy.
> The body of a creature completely drained of life energy becomes a new patch of ghost mold. The victim's [[Soul|soul]] might briefly remain to haunt the area as a [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]], until it too is destroyed by the ghost mold's feeding.


## Green slime

***Main article: [[Green slime]]***
> Green slime is a highly acidic type of semi-intelligent mold that can destroy flesh and other organic materials on contact. It clings to walls, floor, and ceilings, and can detect movement to drop onto prey below. It can also affect wood and metal, but not stone. A creature covered in green slime is quickly dissolved unless the slime is scraped off, frozen, burnt, or destroyed by sunlight.


## Radiation

***Main article: [[Radiation]]***
> Radiation is the emission of natural, magical, or [[Technology|technological]] energies at levels that can harm living creatures, and is common in parts of the Darklands and the technological ruins of [[Numeria]].


## Russet mold

***Main article: [[Russet mold]]***
> The dangerous fungus known as russet mold releases a cloud of spores whenever a creature approaches within five feet. The spores take root in the lungs of unfortunate victims, and in severe cases the creature dies. A day after being killed by russet mold, one or more fully grown [[Vegepygmy|vegepygmies]] emerge from the corpse, with the exact number dependent on the size of the slain creature.
> Russet mold is vulnerable to acid and [[Alcohol|alcohol]], and is dormant in sunlight.


## Shrieker

> A shrieker is a [[Human|human]]-sized purple mushroom. Any light or movement within 10 feet causes it to utter a piercing shriek. This drowns out any other noise and often attracts predators.


## Splintermold

***Main article: [[Splintermold]]***
> Splintermold is a [[Darklands]] fungus that makes stalactites more prone to fall on creatures that pass beneath.


## Yellow mold

> If yellow mold is disturbed, it launches a cloud of poisonous spores in a 10-foot radius. This can prove debilitating or even fatal to those caught within the cloud. Yellow mold is dormant in [[Sun|sunlight]] and can be destroyed by fire.
