> **The Bottoms** is a southern neighborhood in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]].  Located within the massive city walls, the Bottoms is situated on the edge of the [[Storval Rise]], and is home to ex-slaves and abolitionist from all over [[Golarion]].  Fierce believers in the ideals of democracy, its citizens have taken to calling themselves the [[Freemen]].  They oppose forced labor in any form and support the rights of the oppressed and subjugated.  As slavery is legal in Kaer Maga, however, this brings the Freemen into frequent conflict with its proponents.
