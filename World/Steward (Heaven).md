> The **stewards** of [[Heaven]] are tasked with overseeing and organizing the inhabitants of the bottom six levels of the plane. They are not rulers, but serve as authorities on matters concerning their levels. The role of steward is a rotating one and holds great authority within its domain, and even the [[Lawful|lawful]] [[Deity|gods]] grant them deference on matters relating to their tier.
