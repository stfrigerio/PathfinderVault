> **Silk** is a natural fiber that can be woven into textiles. It is typically produced by certain insects, such as silkworms and [[Silk gargoyle|silk gargoyles]]. It is often produced by boiling insectoid cocoons, unraveling their filaments, spinning them into reels of thread, dying the thread into colors as desired, and weaving the thread into fabric. Other sources include [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spiders]] (as well as giant spiders) and other arachnids.
