> Raw **potentiality**, an [[Unaligned|unaligned]] [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] force that courses through the [[Maelstrom]], is one of the most primordial forms of the energy that eventually manifests as a [[Soul|soul]].


## Reclamation

> Upon any [[Outsider|outsiders]] destruction, its [[Alignment|aligned]] quintessence—along with its compiled knowledge and beliefs—is absorbed into its home [[Plane|plane]], or often into other planes if destroyed away from its home plane. Quintessence is perpetually disintegrated from the planes by the [[Maelstrom]] to become unaligned potentiality, at which point it is funneled to the Antipode and redirected to the [[Inner Plane|Inner Planes]]. In the [[Positive Energy Plane]], it becomes part of the source matter of new souls.
