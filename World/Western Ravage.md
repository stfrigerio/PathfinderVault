> The **Western Ravage** is the name given to a large valley in the [[Shattered Range]], on the westernmost edge of the [[Mana Wastes]]. It is an area of dead magic, which has enabled several tribes of giants—[[Hill giant|hill giants]], [[Ogre|ogres]] and [[Ettin|ettins]]—to thrive here.
> The tribes fight one another over territory, but occasionally a strong leader emerges who can unite them. The usual result of such unity is a raid on the nearby [[Gunworks]]. In some cases they have even managed to obtain a few [[Firearm|firearms]] from these raids. The largest of the giants are able to wield cannons as if they were massive [[Rifle|rifles]].
