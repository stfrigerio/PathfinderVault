> The Siphons are a system of underground tunnels beneath the [[Absalom]] district of [[The Puddles|the Puddles]].  They consist of parts of the city's larger sewer system as well as an intricate series of crypts and emergency tunnels.  The frequently flooded nature of these tunnels makes them an ideal location for criminals, who find that the risk of collapse and drowning are enough to keep the law away, and many thieves' guilds and other nefarious elements shore up walls and use the system for their lairs.  Perhaps the best-known of the Siphons' residents is the information broker [[Grandmaster Torch]].
