> The ***Song of Extinction*** has two forms:

> - a melody;
> - a [[Major artifact|major artifact]] in the form of a music box.
> Both devour the [[Soul|souls]] of their victims and transfer their life energy to its singer or wielder, granting them extended life.
> The magic box is currently owned by [[Tyruwat]] the Lost One, who used it on the people of [[Dokaren]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].
> The artifact was created in response to Tyruwat's prayer to [[Zon-Kuthon]]; he was granted knowledge of the lyrics of the *Song of Extinction*, created a music box and inscribed the lyrics on its sides in [[Abyssal Language]]. When a sufficiently strong willed follower of the god sings the lyrics to the accompaniment of the tune from the music box, walls crumble and an entire city can be reduced to ruins. Thus the artifact kills indirectly and indiscriminately.
