> The **Rifardona** is a massive sandbar over twelve miles long which shelters the port and city of [[Westcrown]] from the worst of oceanic tides. Ships sailing into the [[River Adivian]] through [[Gemcrown Bay]] must skirt the Gemcrown Cliffs at the sandbar's edges. The so-called "**Reef of Aroden**" can be treacherous to unwary ship-captains as evidenced by the large number of shipwrecks to be found here.
