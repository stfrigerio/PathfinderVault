> The **Reaping Rock** has been both a blessing and a [[Curse|curse]] to the city of [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]]: it shelters Lady's Harbor from the powerful storms whipping in from [[Lake Encarthan]], but it has also claimed dozens and dozens of [[Ship|ships]] and the lives of countless sailors. Near the cliff's base, hidden rocks and strange currents have resulted in numerous wrecks, all within sight of the safety of the city. The most famous wrecks that lie at Reaping Rock's feet are those of the *Silver Star* and the *Trackless*.
