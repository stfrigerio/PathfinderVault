> **Tokarai Springs** is a rare fertile freshwater spring in desolate [[Devil's Perch|Devils Perch]]; trees grow by its waters, and [[Animal|animals]] drink from it. The [[Windspire tribe]] of [[Strix|strix]] claim the springs as their best source of fresh water. After two bloody battles against forces from [[Cheliax]] attempting to mine nearby [[Sorvus's Strike|Sorvuss Strike]], the Windspire strix secured the springs as part of a 100-year truce.
