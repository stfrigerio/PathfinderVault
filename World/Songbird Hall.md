Shelyn's [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]]: a [[Songbird|songbird]].
> **Songbird Hall** is the temple to [[Shelyn]] in the city of [[Kintargo]]. It is the only [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|good-aligned]] faith permitted in the city.
> During its time, the faith of Shelyn has done its utmost to minimize the harmful effects of infernal rule while still complying with the government's demands. Still, worshipers must register with [[House Thrune]] and all ceremonies must be presided over by an appropriate official.
> The church raises most of its fund by educating wealthy nobles in the [[Art|arts]] before investing those funds back into the community, such as by feeding the hungry and generally improving the quality of life of Kintargo's inhabitants.
> The current high priest is [[Zachrin Vhast]].
