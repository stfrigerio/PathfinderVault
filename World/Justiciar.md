Serving many different roles, from diplomat to judge, jury, and executioner all in one, they continually work towards the further  advancement of society.

## Abilities

**Sure Shot**
Justiciars are masters of the crossbow, and can use the weapon to make particularly accurate and deadly ranged attacks.
**Oathmark**
To a justiciar, an oath is as solemn as law itself. They possess the ability to link two individuals making such a promise. If one party breaks the oath, the other is made aware of the act, and the oath breaker is cursed as a result of his or her betrayal.
