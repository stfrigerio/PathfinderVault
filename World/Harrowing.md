*For another meaning of "Harrowing", please see [[The Harrowing]].*
> An uncommon spell known to [[Varisian]] [[Harrower|fortune-tellers]], ***harrowing*** allows the caster to use a [[Harrow deck]] to perform the [[Harrow]] and tell a fortune for him or herself or someone else. A *harrowing* must cover one specific set of events or course of action, and the caster performs a choosing for each subject and a spread for the course of action. The spread consists of nine cards drawn that represent events or factors of the past, present, and future. A successful *harrowing* may improve the caster's success in the events that may come to pass.
