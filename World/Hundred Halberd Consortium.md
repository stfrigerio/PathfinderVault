> The **Hundred Halberd Consortium** was a wealthy merchant organisation that specialised in trading in [[Magic item|magic items]] and exotic beasts. They operated out of the city of [[Oagon]] in [[Lirgen]].
> The [[Eye of Abendego]] destroyed Oagon, and the Consortium is no more. However, rumours of the treasures contained within the Consortium's magical vaults continue to attract adventurers to Oagon's drowned streets.
