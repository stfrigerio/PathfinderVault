> The **Pyramid of the Dog** is a [[Siege engine|siege engine]] located on the beach south of the town of [[Shoreline]] near [[Absalom]], with easy access to the city's [[The Puddles|Puddles]] district. It is one of the closest siege castles to Absalom's walls. 
> Three battered, ancient towers have collapsed inward toward the fourth, forming a huge wreck. The pyramid had many names over the centuries; its current name derives from a ruthless criminal gang known as the War Hounders, who use the pyramid as their base of operations.
