> The **Lumber Consortium Headquarters** are located just north of the [[High Market]] in the small [[Andoren]] town of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]]. Once the most impressive building in town, now the office remains empty and has fallen into disrepair. [[Thuldrin Kreed]] conducts most of his official business at [[Kreed Manor]]. The building is occasionally used only to host important Consortium guests and for some business Thuldrin wishes to keep out of his private estate. A statue of [[Thalsin Kreed]], Thuldrin's father, is located in the building and is always maintained and freshly polished by Thuldrin's cowed servants.
