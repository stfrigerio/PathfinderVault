> **Spherewalkers** embrace [[Desna|Desnas]] philosophies as they speak to the very core of their being, embracing their endless wanderlust. Spherewalkers make great adventurers, they travel the world with a divine mandate to explore the most extreme and unknown of locations always pushing their luck (which, thanks to be favoured of Desna can seem near limitless). Spherewalkers have achieved a wide range of goals from founding nations on distant continents to discovering lost cities above all they pursue adventure. Spherewalkers can come from any background be from [[Fighter|fighter]] to [[Wizard|wizard]], members of near any class who worship Desna can become a Spherewalker. Spherewalkers abilities assist with travel, improve their ability to use the [[Starknife]] (Desna's favourite weapon), grant great bouts of luck and the most powerful can transform into a beautiful swarm of butterflies (Desna's favoured creatures).
