The **Koumssa Gap** is the easiest place for the [[Path of Aganhei]] to climb from the tundra lowlands of northern [[Avistan]] to the high plains of the Hoarwell March. It is a break in the mountains that surround the high ice of the [[Crown of the World]] with a gentle ascent. At its foot sits the trading town of [[Unaimo]].
