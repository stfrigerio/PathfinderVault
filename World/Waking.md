 Rovagug's unholy symbol
> The **Waking** is one of the two main holidays of [[Rovagug]]. It is celebrated in early spring when [[Orc|orc]] [[Shaman|shamans]] across [[Golarion]] commemorate the Rough Beast's stirrings after the fall of the *[[Starstone]]*. They urge their followers to war with great ceremonies of [[Humanoid|humanoid]] sacrifice and blood.
