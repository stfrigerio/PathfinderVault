## History and use

> Depictions of [[Varisian]] starknives date back centuries and maintains its cultural ties to Varisia despite its close association with Desna's broad worship. Desnan starknives represent the [[God|goddesss]] home of [[Cynosure]], the North Star.
> Starknives are often strapped to a belt, thigh, or forearm, similar to a [[Buckler|buckler]] or [[Dagger|dagger]]. The four blades can be sheathed for extended travel in order to protect them (and the wearer from them).
