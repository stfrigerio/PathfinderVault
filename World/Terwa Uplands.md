> The **Terwa Uplands** is a mountainous, jungle region of [[Garund]] split between the [[Shackles]] and the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. From here the [[Terwa River]] has its source. It is home to one of the region's two primary groups of [[Dwarf|dwarves]]: the traditionalist [[Mbe'ke|Mbeke]] tribe; they live in villages of several hundred dwarves. It is rumoured that there might be one or more [[Sky Citadel|Sky Citadels]] in these mountains.
