> The ruins of **Kembe** are in the southern part of the [[Mwangi Jungle]], in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].
> It consists of three concentric rings of buildings. The buildings of the inner ring are sized for giants, those of the middle ring are sized for humans, and those of the outer ring are sized for halflings. 
> According to the myths carved on the city walls, a race of giants arrived from the sky in silver craft. They built the inner ring of buildings, but over generations found themselves getting smaller and smaller, requiring the building of the middle ring, and then finally the outer ring. Eventually, they shrunk too small to be seen.
