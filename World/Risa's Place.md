> **Risa's Place** is an out of the way tavern located on Undercliff Way in [[Sandpoint]].  Although the [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisian]] [[Sorcerer|sorceress]] [[Risa Magravi]] still owns this establishment, she is now old and blind and leaves the running of it to her children [[Besk Magravi|Besk]], [[Lanalee Magravi|Lanalee]], and [[Vodger Magravi|Vodger]].  Customers come for Risa's telling of myths and legends as well as her delicious spiced potatoes and cider.  Those who frequent the tavern also appreciate that its off-the-beaten-track location generally keeps away strangers.
