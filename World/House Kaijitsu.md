> **House Kaijitsu** is a noble family in [[Magnimar]], formerly known as the **Amatatsu family** of [[Minkai]]. In Minkai, they were one of the five families [[Shizuru]] granted a divine mandate to rule. Pursued by a group of [[Oni|oni]] called the Five Storms who were intent on their destruction, they fled their homeland in the mid-47th century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]]. They left the continent of [[Tian Xia]] and finally settled in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]], where they became part of that city-state's nascent nobility.


## In Magnimar

> Although the family has largely removed itself to the nearby town of [[Sandpoint]], they still maintain a manor home in Magnimar known as [[Kaijitsu Villa]], located in the [[Naos]] district.
