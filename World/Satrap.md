> **Satrap** is a [[Kelish]] term for the ruler of a **satrapy**, one of the provinces or dependent kingdoms of the [[Kelesh|Empire of Kelesh]]. The satrap rules in the [[Padishah Emperor|Padishah Emperors]] stead, and is often appointed to the position. In [[Qadira]], the most well-known satrapy in the [[Inner Sea region]], the satrap is in charge of overseeing the nation's domestic affairs, but has no control over its foreign trade and relations, which are handled by the emperor-appointed [[Vizier|vizier]]. Qadira is unusual among the satrapies of Kelesh, in that the position of satrap is hereditary, rather than appointed by the emperor. The current satrap of Qadira is [[Xerbystes II]].
