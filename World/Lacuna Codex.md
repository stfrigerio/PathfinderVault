> The ***Lacuna Codex*** is a book that played a part in the battles between the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] and the kings of [[Ustalav]]. It may contain the spells that the powerful Lord Virholt was able to cast when he died, and have since been lost. These spells are so powerful that they can rip the very fabric of the world and kill hundreds at a time. It was translated from ancient [[Thassilonian]], and is rumored to be one of the earliest writings of the cult of [[Urgathoa]]. The original *Codex* is a large book, bound in human skin, knitted together. Some of these pieces of skin still show distinctive body parts such as lips and ears.
> In [[4711 AR]], Count [[Varian Jeggare]] found the volume with about 40 others in the vaults of Lord Virholt. Unfortunately, a cult of [[Norgorber]] has the original book, but the spell *[[Steal book|steal book]]* was used to erase it and copy it into another set of pages. The [[Cheliax|Chelish]] [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] was then responsible for the transport this only copy of the recently rediscovered book to the [[Decemvirate]] in [[Absalom]].
