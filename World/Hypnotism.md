*This article covers the hypnotic state. For the [[Arcane magic|arcane magic]] [[Spell|spells]], see hypnotism (spell) and hypnotic pattern.*
> **Hypnotism** uses powerful methods of suggestion, and sometimes [[Psychic magic|psychic]] or [[Arcane|arcane]] coercion, to recover or alter a creature's memories. More intense hypnotic states can leave the hypnotized creature fascinated and pliable to certain commands.
> In addition to [[Occult|occult]] practitioners and [[Magic|magic]] users who deploy mind-altering [[Spell|spells]], several creatures can naturally deploy hypnotic powers, such as the tenebrous blight and even rare variants of [[Flail snail|flail snails]].
