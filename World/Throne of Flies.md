> The **Throne of Flies** is the palace and stronghold of the [[Archdaemon|archdaemon]] [[Apollyon]] on the [[Outer Plane]] of [[Abaddon]].


## The Origins of the Throne

> Apollyon's seat of power is a gigantic monolith, built from the bones of an impossibly massive corpse.  Adorned with its eons-old innards, it is as hideous as it is immense. The identity of the body is one of the many dark mysteries of Abaddon, alternatively claimed to be a dead [[Deity|god]] of healing, a rival patron of [[Disease|pestilence]], or a [[Protean lord|protean lord]] of leviathan proportions dragged from the depths of the [[Maelstrom]].
