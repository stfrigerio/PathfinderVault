> **Grodlych** was one of the two counties of [[Ustalav]] most devastated by the baleful influence of the reborn [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] and the devastation of the [[Shining Crusade]] launched to overthrow the [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|lich]]. After the defeat of the Tyrant, it was combined with its equally desolate neighbor [[Virholt]] to form the new territory of [[Virlych]]. It remained a protectorate of the nation of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] until the fall of that country in [[4719 AR]], before which frequent armed patrols from Lastwall hunted down any [[Undead|undead]] still roaming the land near the Whispering Tyrant's prison of [[Gallowspire]].
