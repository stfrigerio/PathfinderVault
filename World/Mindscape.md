> **Mindscapes** are intentionally constructed areas on the [[Astral Plane]]. Creatures can create a mindscape by engaging in a psychic duel, casting [[Spell|spells]], using [[Artifact|artifacts]], or performing a [[Ritual|ritual]]. Because mindscapes are entirely constructed by their creator, they can appear in any way the creator so desires: from the utterly fantastical, to a simulacrum indistinguishable from reality.


## Types of mindscape

> Scholars have differentiated mindscapes into two distinct categories: binary mindscapes and immersive mindscapes. The binary mindscape is the hollow background for a psychic duel. The area is little more than a blank canvas on which to carry out a battle of the minds. The immersive mindscape, however, presents a fully realized sensory experience to those who find themselves within it.


## Mindscape conditions

> Regardless of its type, the rules of the environment within the mindscape are solely controlled by its creator. Elements such as the ability to know that one is in a mindscape, the area and boundaries of the mindscape, whether or not one can be harmed within the mindscape, and the function of natural, [[Arcane|arcane]], and spiritual forces can all be manipulated by the mindscape's creator.
