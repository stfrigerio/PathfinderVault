> A **trap** is a device or plot intended to detain, kill, harm, or surprise a creature. Traps are unknowingly triggered by the victim's presence or actions—such as opening a door, picking something up, or switching something on—and sometimes have some form of bait designed to lure the victim toward it. Traps might be used to capture or kill wild [[Animal|animals]], deter [[Dungeon|dungeoneers]], or repel or kill trespassers who violate personal or restricted areas. Traps are more common in uninhabited or actively defended locations; a peacefully inhabited site (or one overrun with monsters) is unlikely to still have many active traps remaining.

## Types

![[Traps.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 To the detriment of [[Harsk]] and [[Seelah]], [[Valeros]] steps on the trigger for flaming pit and swinging [[Axe|axe]] traps.
> Most traps are mechanical devices [[Engineering|engineered]] to perform a specific action when triggered, and might be as simple as a false floor over a pit or a complex, cascading contraption with far-reaching effects. Some are [[Magic|magical]] in nature, whether as a component or enhancement of a mechanical trap, wholly comprised of [[Spell|spells]] and other magical devices or triggers, or created from nothing by a spell.


## Creation

*See also: [[CategoryTrapsmiths]] and [[CategoryTrap shops]]*
> A person who creates traps is often called a **trapsmith**. Mechanical traps are created in much the same manner as any other mechanical device, though this process can be aided by [[Magic item|magic items]], such as a *ring of maniacal devices*.
> Magical traps are most often created through spells, and through magic items that can contain spells or similar abilities, such as a *staff of traps*.


## Detection

> Traps are typically designed to be camouflaged and require a keen eye for most people to detect before triggering them. Many [[Rogue|rogues]] are especially adept at sensing the presence of traps, and [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] can enhance their senses to detect traps.


### Disarming

> Detecting a trap is often the most difficult part of dealing with them; a known trap can be avoided or disarmed. Traps can often be disabled with a steady hand, careful analysis, and the right set of [[Thieves' tools|tools]]. However, lingering at the site of a trap to disable it is sometimes as dangerous as the trap itself.


## As equipment

> Traps are useful in defense and for hunting. Sharp-jawed bear traps are commonly sold for a few [[Gold piece|gold pieces]], and string is often employed to create tripwires and alarms.


## On Golarion

> Many of [[Golarion|Golarions]] dungeons and tombs contain traps, as do several fortifications, closely guarded locations, and containers such as chests. The pyramids of [[Osirion]] are particularly renowned for their many complex mechanical and magical traps.
> Notable examples of traps on Golarion include:
