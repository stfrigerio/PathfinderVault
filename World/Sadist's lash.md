> The ***sadist's lash*** is a [[Mechanics/Spells/Spells/Level 1/Magic Weapon|magical]] [[Whip|whip]] first constructed during the days of ancient [[Thassilon]], most probably by the mages of the Realm of Lust, [[Eurythnia]]. Made of black leather with wires of [[Silver|silver]] alloy running through it, the enchanted lash causes its victims to bleed profusely. Its wielder can cast any [[Spell|spell]] through it that would otherwise require one to physically touch the target, and also makes its victims highly susceptible to [[Magic/Enchantment|enchantment]] spells; this vulnerability subsides after about a minute.
