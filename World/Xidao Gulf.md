> The **Xidao Gulf** is a shallow sea between [[Minkai]] and continental [[Tian Xia]]. Beneath its waves lies the underwater nation of [[Xidao]].
> The gulf features abundant shellfish and pearls, including rare and well-renowned black pearls. However, those who harvest from the gulf are expected to provide offerings of valuables, such as tools, [[Weapon|weapons]], and surface-grown vegetables, at Xidao trade spires scattered across its surface.
