*For another meaning of "Sentinel", please see [[Sentinel prestige class]].*
> **The Sentinel** is an ancient fabricated satellite of the [[Planet|planet]] [[Eox]], designed by unknown hands as an orbiting defence system for the planet below. Today it is crewed by [[Bone sage|bone sages]], who still successfully use the Sentinel in the same way, despite much of the satellite being out of use.
