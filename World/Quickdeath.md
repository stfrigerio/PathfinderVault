> **Quickdeath** is a natural gas found in isolated pockets throughout the [[Darklands]]. Colorless and odorless, this hazard is heavier than air and collects in lower-lying pockets. Air-breathing creatures who enter an area contaminated with quickdeath immediately begin to choke and suffocate, as the gas is toxic.
