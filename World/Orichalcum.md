> Also known as **horacalcum**, **orichalcum** is the rarest of the [[Skymetal|skymetals]]. It has the amazing property of warping [[Time|time]] around it, either by slowing it down or speeding it up. Possessing the weight and density of steel, orichalcum has a dull, coppery appearance that can deceive ignorant examiners into believing that the skymetal is instead a far baser substance.
> Due to its extreme rarity, it is unusual for orichalcum to be found in quantities greater than a pound, although [[Weapon|weapons]] and (fearsomely expensive) [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] made from the metal allow the wearer to both react more quickly and also to perceive time around them moving more slowly. Any damage to orichalcum mends itself after just 24 hours.
> Orichalcum is associated with [[Illusion|illusion magic]], humility, and pride. Unsurprisingly, it was also favored by the [[Thassilonian]] [[Xanderghul|Runelord of Pride]] during that empire's reign.
