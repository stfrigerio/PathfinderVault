> Once the busiest gate in the city, the **Salt Gate** is now a useless relic: the internal workings of the gate have rusted so much that the gate can no longer be used and is stuck open. The Salt Gate's usage declined as more and more shipping moved away from [[Old Harbor]] to [[Yolubilis Harbor]] and the Foreign Quarter of [[Jarvis End]], but it is still used by the traders of [[Salt Market]].
