> **Ilsur's Arena** was built when [[Ilsur]] and his followers founded the town of [[Ilsurian]], being the establishment with the longest legacy in town. Back then, it was used for the training of [[Warrior|warriors]] who would be marched against [[Korvosa]]. The arena is still used today for martial training and is sanctified in the name of [[Iomedae]]. Three times per day all fighting must stop for one hour to allow for prayer. Several citizens serve as experts on various [[Weapon|weapons]] and their work is supported by the city. They include [[Polearm|polearms]] master Kyresti Peorus, archer Pryannion Varaccus, and the popular [[Sword|swordmaster]] Lidia Chegarre.
