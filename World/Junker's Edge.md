 A [[Goblin|goblin]] scavenges on Junk Beach.
> **Junker's Edge**, and by extension **Junk Beach**, are the ultimate destinations for much of the garbage and unwanted items in the town of [[Sandpoint]]. Such refuse is gathered by a [[Half-orc|half-orc]] dung-sweeper named [[Gorvi]] and his employees, then dumped over the cliff. Despite protests by the faithful of [[Gozreh]], Sandpoint's town council feels it is best to allow such waste to be managed by the tides.



## Services

> Junker's Edge acts as a general dumping ground where citizens can dispose of the unwanted with the intent that it be carried out to sea.


## Notable individuals

[[Gorvi]]
One of only a handful of half-orcs to populate Sandpoint, Gorvi acts as the town's dung-sweeper. He is paid well for his services since no one else particularly wishes to be responsible for working in his stead.
[[Hannah Velerin]]
Velerin is a follower of Gozreh and an outspoken opponent of the dumping practices used at Junker's Edge.

## Junk Beach

> Junk Beach is the area underneath the cliffs where the garbage sits until washed out by the tide. The [[Seven Tooth]] tribe of [[Goblin|goblins]] sneak onto the beach some mornings and take whatever items strike them as suitable treasure.
