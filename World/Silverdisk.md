> **Silverdisks** are small, etched silver disks frequently used in place of [[Currency|currency]] by the people of [[Numeria]]. They are presumably of alien origin, as they are found most frequently in or near the wreckage of spaceships (such as [[Silver Mount]]) that fell to [[Golarion]] during the [[Rain of Stars]].
