> **Restoration Park** is located next to the looming [[Castle Stryithe]] in the heart of the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] capital of [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]]. Restoration Park was built by the aristocracy of Caliphas after the end of the [[Shining Crusade]] by sealing off then burying an older part of the city. The park's most prominent feature is an enormous iron glass house that is home to many exotic species brought to Ustalav from warmer climes. The park's other statuary includes a statue of [[Sesasgia Caliphvaso]] who refounded Caliphas after the defeat of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]], and "The Valiant Charge" a huge statue of Ustalav's founder, [[Soividia Ustav]]. The park also includes a reflecting pool, commissioned by [[Ilmhost Vheist]], that is lined with columns depicting soldiers of the Shining Crusade facing off against barbaric [[Kellid|Kellids]], [[Orc|orcs]] from the [[Hold of Belkzen]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]], and a variety of [[Undead|undead]] horrors including [[Dullahan|dullahans]] and [[Graveknight|graveknights]].
