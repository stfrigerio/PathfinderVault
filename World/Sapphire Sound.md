> **Sapphire Sound** is a large sea to the north of the [[Xidao Gulf]] in the northern reaches of [[Tian Xia]]. It serves as the northern border of [[Chu Ye]], which lines the south of the Sapphire Sound, while to the north, separated by the sound, lies the mysterious [[Forest of Spirits]]. The Sapphire Sound also borders [[Hongal]], the tundra of the [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Horse|horse]] lords, forming much of its southern and eastern borders and mostly separating it from Chu Ye and the Forest of Spirits. Finally, it also extends to the north-westernmost edge of the peninsular nation of [[Minkai]].
