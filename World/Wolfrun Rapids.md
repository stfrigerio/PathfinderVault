> **Wolfrun Rapids** of [[Foam River]] in [[Andoran]] is a 3-mile stretch of whitewater at the point where the river punches through the Wolfrun Hills via a narrow gorge before dumping into the [[Andossan River]]. Wolfrun Rapids is a great difficulty for the floating logs down the river and much timber is lost there. Multiple efforts to smooth out the rapids have failed because of the frequent landslides and also the many logs that have become snared in the rapids over the years.
