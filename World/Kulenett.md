 A Kulenett dwarf.
> The **Kulenett** are a [[Grondaksen]] [[Dwarf|dwarven]] ethnicity who live nomadic lives in intricate tunnels below the mountains of [[Geb's Rest]].


## Appearance

> Kulenett have deep tawny skin, reddish-orange eyes, and straight, thick dark hair. When travelling above ground, they wear light [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] and travelling clothes, including goggles to shield their eyes from the sand.


## Culture

> The Kulenett's underground tunnel network stretches across the entirety of Geb, and few can navigate it without having lived there for their whole lives. No outsider has returned with evidence of the oasis-cities protected by [[Positive energy|positive energy]] from Gebbite [[Necromancy|necromancy]] and corruption, where the Kulenett claim to live. Despite their opposition to necromancy, the Kulenett maintain relations with Geb out of necessity.
