> The "**Winter Palace**" of [[Ysborg]], the 'Steading of the Ice Trolls', at the far south-eastern corner of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Southmoor]], is the bastion of Ysborg's ruler: the [[Blue Jarl]]. It is one of of Ysborg's few stone buildings. It is nothing more than a blocky pile of icy rocks but it is well-fortified. The throne of the Blue Jarl is made from carved [[Mammoth|mammoth]] tusks and is decorated with [[Human|human]] skulls. The Blue Jarl's kennels, just outside the palace are filled with [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]] who have sworn allegiance to the jarl and the Bear Pits host ferocious [[Polar bear|polar]] and [[Grizzly bear|grizzly bears]] [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armored]] and trained to fight.
