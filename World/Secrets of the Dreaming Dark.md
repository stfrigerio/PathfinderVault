> ***Secrets of the Dreaming Dark*** is an anonymous work written in [[Aklo]] late in the [[Age of Darkness]]. It supposedly contains methods for contacting agents of the [[Dominion of the Black]] and describes formulae and rituals capable of summoning [[Neh-thalggu|neh-thalggu]], [[Neshmaal|neshmaals]], and various other alien creatures.
> The first half of the book is devoted to conflicting reports on hundreds of [[Planet|worlds]] said to exist within or be touched by the [[Dark Tapestry]]. The remainder of the book is split between rare and dangerous [[Spell|spells]], a few frenetic passages regarding various [[Great Old One|Great Old Ones]] and [[Outer God|Outer Gods]], and a series of verses detailing 61 different individuals' dreams—each accompanied by a date and a cause of death. The last 32 pages of all seven remaining copies are almost completely blotted out, with only a handful of words left unobscured: "house," "home," and in one case, "firmament" written in red.


## History

> In ancient [[Osirion]], [[Neferuset|Queen Neferuset]] was exposed to the *Secrets of the Dreaming Dark* as a child, and shortly thereafter became an [[Oracle|oracle]] of the Dark Tapestry. Though she wished to be interred with her [[Dwarf|dwarf]]-skin-bound copy, a defiant advisor burned the book and scattered its ashes across the desert.
> Another copy of *Secrets of the Dreaming Dark* is known to have been the final tome procured by [[Gaius Beaulenard]], noted [[Oppara|Opparan]] scholar on the subject of the Dominion of the Black. Following his mysterious death in [[4612 AR]], this copy was sold to an unknown collector.
> Within the Cathedral of Embodied Wisdom, in [[Nidal]]'s capital city of [[Pangolais]], lies the secret of an original copy of the work's location.
> The last known copy to have surfaced—incomplete though it was—was found in the hands of the [[Rahadoum|Rahadoumi]] [[Wizard|wizard]] Balthus Hunclay after he relocated to the town of [[Belhaim]], [[Taldor]].
