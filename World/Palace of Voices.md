> The **Palace of Voices** serves as the most significant [[Opera|opera]] house and theatre in the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] capital of [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]]. For the elite of the city, the Palace of Voices serves as a hub of culture despite the conflicts and intrigues occurring behind the scenes. The Palace of Voices is owned by the brother and sister [[Paulo Carameizta|Paulo]] and [[Marrian Carameizta]] who inherited it from their parents. The pair's relationship is full of petty dislikes, long-standing sibling rivalries, and they both have diametrically opposed ideas about how best to run the theatre leading them to detest each other. While Paulo and Marrian engage in endless petty squabbling, the Palace of Voices employees now look to the conductor [[Aldentor Rudono]] for artistic leadership. Aldentor's love-hate relationship with [[Calmadra Vhalikackos]] of the [[Karcau Opera]] is well known.
