> **The Jailed Emergence** is a sinkhole that plummets down into the [[Darklands]], through [[Nar-Voth]] and into [[Sekamina]], with a terminus near the [[Drow|drow]] city of [[Giratayn]]. The surface entrance is ringed with stone towers oriented toward defending the surface from subterranean interlopers, and [[Prophet of Kalistrade|Prophets of Kalistrade]] fund protective walls that also mask their far quieter [[Slavery|slave trade]] with Darklands drow.
