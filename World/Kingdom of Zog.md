Land: River Kingdoms
---

> The **Kingdom of Zog** was a small empire of [[Goblin|goblins]] ruled by a dynasty of seven [[Barghest|barghests]] in the [[River Kingdoms]].
> First created in [[4071 AR]], the kingdom sprang up after goblins overwhelmed the young kingdom of [[Alban]] (modern-day [[Lambreth]]) and took its place as master of the region. Ruled over by barghests, the empire survived until [[4217 AR]] when the [[Yellowtongue Sickness]] swept through the region, crippling the kingdom. It then fell to a loose coalition of [[Adventurer|adventurers]], riverfolk, and [[Half-elf|half-elves]] that same year.
> The goblins of Zog left behind many pits, delves, and hidden cave complexes that have yet to be explored.
