> **Thremyr's Steps** in [[Tusk Mountains]] is a rocky passage between the mountains to the [[Crown of the World]]. [[Frost giant]] legend says that this ragged passage was forced by [[Thremyr]] when he awakened from his slumber by the [[Starstone]]'s fall. Frost giants consider it as sacred ground but it is held by [[Ice troll|ice trolls]], [[Cold rider|cold riders]], and [[Winter fey|winter fey]]. At the height of the steps resides a lone [[Norn|norn]] with mythic abilities, called the [[Fate Watcher]], holding a court of [[Troll|trolls]] and [[Fey|fey]].
