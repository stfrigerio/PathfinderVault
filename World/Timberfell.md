> In the early years of the [[Andoren]] democracy, the government of [[Almas]] sold off parts of the [[North End]] neighborhood to the [[Lumber Consortium]] to generate funds. This part of town became known as the **Timberfell**, and is still wholly owned by the Consortium to this day. Even though it is technically a part of Almas, the Timberfell is under the jurisdiction of [[Ryma Bloodthorn|Gavel Ryma Bloodthorn]], a notoriously heavy-handed enforcer who works for the company. Timberfell is the north-westernmost neighborhood of Almas, and is bounded to the south by the [[Tamuth River]], and to the north by the [[Andoshen River|Andoshen]].
