> The **Nightways Gate** and the [[Night Road]] it is named for link [[Kintargo]] to its shadowy northern neighbour [[Nidal]] via the scholastic district of [[Villegre]]. The gate and road form an awkward but necessary trade route; due to Kintargo's distance from [[Cheliax|Cheliaxs]] central heartlands, goods from Nidal are often cheaper than domestic commodities. Unfortunately, this route also grants the fell influence of Nidalese culture another in-road into Cheliax.
