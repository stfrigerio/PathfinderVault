> A **tumblefire** is a weather event most commonly encountered during the summer months in southern [[Avistan]], particularly [[Andoran]], [[Cheliax]], and [[Taldor]]. It can best to described as a thunderstorm without rain, where lightning flashes through the heavens and thunder booms in response. On rare occasions, a particular type of ball lighting will strike the ground and roll along it like a tumbleweed that generates no heat or fire and only gives a mild shock if touched. Observers have reported that this lightning seems to be attracted to [[Metal|metal]] and can even be directed with pitchforks or knitting needles.
