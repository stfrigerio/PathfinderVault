> The **Storval Rise** is a cliff of immense proportions which stretches across the width of [[Varisia]], dividing it in two like an unavoidable facial scar.  Reaching heights of over a thousand feet in the south, the Rise begins as low as only a few hundred feet in the north, by the [[Velashu Uplands]].  It is here, at the cliff's lowest point, that ancient [[Giant|giants]] built the [[Storval Stairs]], which still provide the easiest access from the fertile lowlands to the harsh [[Storval Plateau]] above.  Much of the cliff face is filled with ancient statues and monoliths, relics from the long-lost empire of [[Thassilon]].  One such ruin is the mysterious hexagonal city of [[Kaer Maga]], which sits atop the edge of the Rise at the falls created as the [[Yondabakari River]] plummets to the land below.
