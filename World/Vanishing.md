> The **Vanishing** is a mysterious event that occurred in the nation of [[Brevoy]] in early [[4699 AR]] in which every member of the ruling [[House Rogarvia]] disappeared without a trace, leaving the country to be governed by the other feuding noble houses. Prior to this, the descendents of [[Choral the Conqueror]] ruled the unified nation Brevoy for two hundred year from the [[Dragonscale Throne|Dragonscale Thrones]]. In their absence, House Rogarvia was replaced by [[House Surtova]] as the ruling dynasty in Brevoy, and [[Noleski Surtova]] now reigns from the [[Ruby Fortress]] in [[New Stetven]]. No explanation of the fate of House Rogarvia has ever been put forward and the Vanishing remains a mystery over a decade later.
