> The **Korradath** is the former royal castle and seat of Imperial [[Cheliax]] in the Regio Corna section of [[Westcrown]]. A massive fortified castle, it remains an impressive sight even though it has not seen any major upkeep since before the death of [[Gaspodar|King Gaspodar]] in Neth of [[4622 AR]]. It is still used by Wiscrani nobles for offices, temporary lodgings, or neutral meeting places for visitors to Westcrown that need to be impressed and protected from the rabble of the streets. Persistent rumors tell of secret, monster haunted dungeons located below the castle that have not been fully explored since Aroden's Fall.
