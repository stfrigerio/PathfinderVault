> The **Tempering Hall** is a combat school located across the main street from the [[Seventh Church]] in the [[Ascendant Court]] district of [[Absalom]]. The facility traditionally trains [[Paladin|paladins]] of [[Iomedae]] as well as those called by [[Abadar]], [[Irori]], and [[Shelyn]], a few of whom supplement the dozens of paladins of Iomedae trained by the elderly priests. However, in recent years, the Hall has started accepting anyone dedicated to fighting [[Evil|evil]]. A specialism of the school is teaching mastery of a [[Deity|gods]] favoured weapon to that deity's followers.


## Curriculum

> The three-year course of study and training overcomes many prospective paladins who undertake it, though its rigors and renown are such that even a single season of training is considered valuable preparation against powerful foes.


### Faculty

> [[Evandor Malik]] is the Knight Lord of the Tempering Hall, a position previously occupied by [[Rochae Swiftblade]].
