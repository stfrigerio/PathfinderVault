> A **flindbar** comprises two [[Iron|iron]] bars, ringed with spikes or studs, linked together with a heavy chain. Though it resembles a nunchaku, it is significantly heavier due to its metal parts. The flindbar is the signature [[Weapon|weapon]] of [[Flind|flinds]]—a more powerful variant of [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]]—and all flinds are naturally proficient with this weapon despite its difficulty of use.
