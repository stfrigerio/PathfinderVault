> Home of the noted [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] [[Canayven Heidmarch]] and [[Venture-Captain]] [[Sheila Heidmarch]], **Heidmarch Manor** is the first [[Pathfinder lodge]] in all [[Varisia]], serving as the [[Pathfinder Society|Pathfinder Societys]] base of operations into the rest of Varisia. Heidmarch Manor is located in [[Magnimar]], the so-called "City of Monuments", within the prosperous [[Alabaster District]] of the city's wealthy [[Summit Magnimar district|Summit]] area. The manor lies just north of the [[Triodea]] in the neighboring [[Naos|Naos District]]. The manor contains all the usual amenities of a Pathfinder lodgeâ€”including some with a Varisian twist.
> As the lodge is also the residence of Canayven and Sheila Heidmarch, it contains their personal residence decorated with mementos of their earlier adventures, ranging from [[Taldan]] suits of [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] to the stuffed remains of fearsome monsters. The lodge has individual cottages for visiting Pathfinders, known as the Thassilonian Houses, each named after one of the ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] realms that once ruled over the land: [[Eurythnia|Eurythnia House]], [[Bakrakhan|Bakrakhan House]], [[Shalast|Shalast House]], and [[Haruka|Haruka House]]. The actual lodge is known as the **Meeting House** and features a meeting room, a lecture hall, a library with a large collection of *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]* and essays on Varisian history, and a showroom lined with ancient Thassilonian [[Artifact|artifacts]]. Currently, along with the owners, the lodge serves as the home for two other Pathfinders: [[Almya Gorangal]] and [[Joadric Heimurl]], both of whom are planning expeditions into different areas in central Varisia.
> Sheila and Canayven would fund any mission that Pathfinders were sent out to Heidmarch Manor to do, however, after recent discoveries in Varisia, the [[Decemvirate]] has funded all endeavors in the region.
