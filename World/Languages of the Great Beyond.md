> Given the size of the [[Multiverse|multiverse]], there are bound to be countless languages spoken within it. What follows is but a small sampling of languages spoken on other [[Plane|planes]] and [[Planet|planets]], both within and from outside of [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Solar system|solar system]].


## Abyssal

***Main article: [[Abyssal Language]]***
> Some believe that Abyssal was the first language developed by the inhabitants of the [[Outer Sphere]]. Given the incredible rate of change within the tongue, this is very difficult to prove. Although it is the native language of the [[Demon|demons]] of the [[Abyss]], it is also spoken by many [[Devil|devils]], [[Daemon|daemons]], or others who have frequent dealings with races of the lower realms. Abyssal is spoken on Golarion in the [[Worldwound]], a region in northern [[Avistan]] with a direct connection to the Abyss that is overrun by demons. In [[Tian Xia]], Abyssal is most commonly spoken among the [[Oni|oni]] and other evil [[Spirit|spirits]].


## Androffan

*For other meanings of "**Androffan**", please see [[Androffan disambiguation]].*
> Androffan is the native language of inhabitants of [[Androffa]], including the creatures and [[Robot|robots]] that crewed the *[[Divinity]]* [[Spaceship|spaceship]] that crashed into [[Numeria]] during the [[Rain of Stars]]. Many of Numeria's ruins are inscribed in this complex language, and few Golarion natives outside of the [[Technic League]] can speak or read it; indeed, the League actively hides documentation and teaching methods for learning the language. Nevertheless, it has been proved that [[Magic|magic]], such as the spell *comprehend languages* can successfully decipher the script.
> To the ear, Androffan is clipped and sharp; in written form it is quite alien to other forms of writing on Golarion, using multiple dots to supplement a curved and graceful script.


## Aquan

> Aquan, from the [[Plane of Water]], grew from a proto-elemental language which was the progenitor of all elemental languages. Much of its vocabulary is taken up with water-related terms. It is a guttural language with many long syllables made up of dense, throaty sounds, with affixes and inflections providing subtle shifts in meaning. Aquan is spoken in [[Tian Xia]] in the [[Kraken|kraken-ruled]] underwater nation of [[Xidao]] and by those who wish to do business with this strange realm. It is sometimes known as the "tongue of the sea" there.


## Auran

> Auran is a soft-spoken, breathy language which shares a similar grammar with the other elemental languages.  It is primarily spoken by those of the [[Plane of Air|Elemental Plane of Air]], and occasionally by the inhabitants of the [[Wall of Heaven Mountains]] and the nation of [[Zi Ha]] in [[Tian Xia]], where it is sometimes referred to as the "tongue of the heavens".


## Brethedan

> Brethedan is the language spoken by the large, jellyfish-like natives of the gas giant [[Planet|planet]] [[Bretheda]], also called [[Brethedan|Brethedans]]. The language is extremely difficult for [[Humanoid|humanoids]] to understand or to use for communication.
> 


## Celestial

> Celestial is spoken by all [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|benevolent]] races of the [[Outer Sphere]]. It shares aspects of its structure with both [[Nonhuman languages of GolarionSylvan|Sylvan]] and [[Nonhuman languages of GolarionDraconic|Draconic]], with few voiced consonants and lightly voiced vowels. In [[Tian Xia]], Celestial is the official language of the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aasimar|aasimar]] nation of [[Tianjing]], and is growing in popularity in [[Kwanlai]] as well.


## Cyrunian

> A language spoken by [[Witchwyrd|witchwyrds]].


## Daemonic

***Main article: Daemonic***
> Daemonic is the language spoken primarily by [[Daemon|daemons]] of [[Abaddon]].


## D'ziriak

> The [[D'ziriak|dziriak]] are insect-like natives of the [[Shadow Plane]] who communicate using a language of their own also called D'ziriak. The language sounds quite simply like insect noises: a buzzing and a chittering noise. Fortunately, the creatures can communicate with other races using telepathy.


## Languages of Planet Earth

> It seems that the [[Human|humans]] of the planet [[Earth]] have many languages, and this list is unlikely to be comprehensive:


### Balachka

> Balachka is a dialect of the Cossacks.


### Church Slavonic

> Church Slavonic is the primary liturgical language of the Russian Orthodox Church.


### Cimmerian

> A language of an ancient civilization on Earth.


### Czech

> Czech is the language of the [[httpenwikipediaorgKingdom of Bohemia|Kingdom of Bohemia]], but it is also spoken by certain [[Mandragora|mandragora]].


### Greek

> Greek is the language of the [[httpenwikipediaorgKingdom of Greece|Kingdom of Greece]], as well as the adjective for describing someone or something from Greece.


### Polish

> Polish is the language of the Polish people of eastern Europe. This language is known to be understood by [[Baba Yaga]].


### Proto-Indo-European

> Proto-Indo-European is an early form of many modern languages of Earth.


### Russian

> Russian is the language of the people of [[Russia]], a large country on the distant [[Planet|planet]] of Earth. This language is known to be understood by [[Baba Yaga]].


### Sarmatian

> A language of an ancient civilization on Earth. This language is the first language of [[Baba Yaga]].


### Scythian

> A language of an ancient civilization on Earth.


## Elder Thing

> The super-intelligent [[Elder thing|elder things]], or "old ones", speak their own language also called Elder Thing. Due to the creature's alien form, the language is extremely difficult for other creatures to speak; it consists of high pitched shouts and doleful woodwind sounds. The written language is equally alien, being spun in circular patterns looking like nonsensical dots.


## First Speech or Feycommon

> Almost all creatures in the [[First World]] that can speak do so in the First World's ubiquitous, but unnamed, tongue. Outsiders have dubbed this common language as **"First Speech"** or **"Feycommon"**. The language is similar to both [[Sylvan]] and [[Aklo]] to such an extent that those fluent in either language can generally understand First Speech as well, so First Speech may have been the root of both of those languages.


## Grioth

> Grioth is both the name of the language and of the [[Grioth|batlike humanoid creatures]] who speak it.


## Ib

> Ib is the language used by [[Being of Ib|beings of Ib]]. These creatures are unable to speak in the fashion understood by, say, humans but their language uses facial expressions and hand movements to communicate. They can also learn and understand other species' languages.


## Ignan

> The language of the [[Plane of Fire|Elemental Plane of Fire]], Ignan is a quick, percussive language, said to emulate the popping of a fire. In [[Tian Xia]], Ignan is also known as the "tongue of fire" and is most commonly spoken in the volcanic mountains of central [[Nagajor]] and the [[Valashmai Jungle]].


## Infernal

> Spoken predominantly in [[Hell]] and by those who traffic with it, Infernal is a concise language which requires precise speech. It contains many homophones in its vocabulary, leading to great confusion among novice speakers, as similar-sounding words can have widely varying meaning. In [[Tian Xia]], Infernal is sometimes spoken by [[Oni|oni]] and other evil [[Spirit|spirits]].


## Jandelayan

> Jandelayan is the supposed language spoken by the inhabitants of the mythical realm of [[Jandelay]]. The only creature known to have ever spoken it is the one most closely related to that place: the [[Oliphaunt of Jandelay]].


## Lashunta

> The humanoid race who live on the planet [[Castrovel]] known as the [[Lashunta|lashunta]] speak their own language. Most lashunta also speak [[Elven|elven]] and can communicate with others via [[Telepathy|telepathy]].


## Mi-Go

> The unique language of the extraterrestrial plant life known as [[Mi-go]] consists of clicks of their pincers and subtle colour changes of their heads. This inseparable connection of the language with elements of a Mi-go's body makes it an almost impossible language to be mastered by non-Mi-go creatures.


## Ningese

> Ningese is a language spoken on the planet [[Triaxus]], the seventh planet in Golarion's solar system. It is spoken by the people of the island continent and independent empire called the [[Ning|Immortal Suzerainty of Ning]].


## Protean

> Protean is the ever-changing language of the [[Protean|proteans]], who are natives of the [[Maelstrom]]. The language's mutability makes it very difficult to record or study in either its hissed vocalized form or its written form.


## Reptoid

> [[Reptoid|Reptoids]] are mysterious reptilian creatures from another planet or even another plane that use their own language, Reptoid, to communicate.


## Shae

> Shae is the language spoken by and named after the mysterious humanoids of the [[Shadow Plane]] called [[Shae|shae]].


## Shobhad

> Shobhad is the language spoken by and named after the four-armed giant inhabitants of the [[Planet|planet]] [[Akiton]]: [[Shobhad|shobhads]].


## Terran

> Like the other elemental languages, Terran sentences always begin with the subject, followed by the object and the verb. It is an extremely slow language and not meant to be rushed. In [[Tian Xia]], Terran is also known as the "tongue of earth" and is commonly spoken in their [[Darklands of Tian Xia|Darklands]].
> The [[Plane of Earth|Plane of Earths]] oldest [[Earth elemental|earth elementals]] speak a version of Terran that is so ancient it is incomprehensible to any others, including native Terran speakers. It is believed this form of the language is that spoken when the Plane of Earth formed, and maybe from even before that time.


## Triaxian or Triaxian Common

> Triaxian Common, or simply Triaxian, is a language spoken on the planet Triaxus, the seventh planet in Golarion's solar system. It is a trade language spoken by many more creatures than the [[Triaxian]] [[Humanoid|humanoids]] who dominate the planet. Only [[Draconic language|draconic]] is as widely spoken and understood on the planet. This language is known to be understood by [[Baba Yaga]].


## Truespeech

> While not a language per-se, truespeech is a magical form of communication possessed by [[Angel|angels]], [[Archon|archons]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Culture/Races/Azata|azatas]], which allows them to speak with any creature that possesses a language. Mortals are not known to be capable of using truespeech, although on very rare occasions, [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lords]] have been known to bestow this power on worthy [[Paladin|paladins]] in their service. Truespeech is also spoken by the undead personifications of death known as [[Grim reaper|grim reapers]], and the [[Divine servitor|divine servitor]] race of [[Abadar|Abadars]] called the [[Orsheval|orsheval]].


## Utopian

> Utopian is the language of [[Axis]], [[Aeon|aeons]], [[Inevitable|inevitables]], and [[Axiomite|axiomites]]. Aeons demonstrated to axiomites after the Convergence that the language is a combination of aeon principles and formulaic [[Mathematical|mathematical]] expression.


## Yaddithian

> Yaddithian is spoken by and named after the race of alien [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aberration|aberrations]] called [[Yaddithian|yaddithians]].


## Yithian

> Yithian is the language spoken by, and named after, the alien [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aberration|aberrations]] called [[Yithian|yithians]].
