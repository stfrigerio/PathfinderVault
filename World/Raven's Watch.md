> **Raven's Watch** was a fort constructed on the northern banks of the [[Turandarok River]] in the [[Ravenroost|Ravenroost tors]] of [[Varisia|Varisias]] Sandpoint hinterlands. The prison was abandoned when [[Sandpoint]] grew large enough to support its own garrison and jail, and rumours about a haunting or a curse have swirled around the prison since. 
> Though the above-ground portion of the prison quickly crumbled into ruin, the lower portions, where the guards were said to have left some prisoners, remain largely intact. A band of bandits aligned with the [[Lamashtu|Cult of Lamashtu]] are now said to have taken up watch within the prison's ruins..
