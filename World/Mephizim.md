> **Mephizim**, sometimes spelt 'Mephism', is the name of the stinking [[Abyssal realm]] of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Gogunta]]. It is a vast swamp floating on the Abyssal sea of [[Ishiar]], [[Dagon]]'s realm. This realm within a realm is very unusual for the demon lords but Dagon seems to take little interest in Gogunta's business. Compared with Dagon's realm, however, Mephizim is tiny in comparison, and the Shadow of the Sea is content to let Gogunta conduct his blasphemous rituals there.


## Inhabitants

> Mephizim is home to the largest population of [[Hezrou|hezrou]] [[Demon|demons]] in the [[Great Beyond]]. Gogunta is known to take hezrou as her mates.
