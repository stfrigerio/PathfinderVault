![[Amaryllis_Hollendock.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A [[Halfling|halfling]] sorcerer.
> The intense power the **sorcerer** commands comes from their [[Magic|magical]] blood. Regardless of the source of their [[Bloodline|bloodline]]—a [[Deity|deity]]'s special favor, a powerful magical lineage, a celestial or horrifying progenitor, or simply the whim of fate or a quirk in the magical weave—the sorcerer is the product of an innate and unbreakable connection to magic that other [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] must devote their lives to mastering. And yet this very boon is also the sorcerer's potential undoing; the sorcerer is defined by her connection to magic, but can be just as easily consumed by it. Their sorcerous gifts and abilities manifest in numerous individual ways, reflecting their diverse sources of power, and while some strive through disciplined practice and meditation to control their power, others give in to the temptation of unfettered magic and allow their power to control them.



## Abilities

> Ability to manipulate magic comes naturally to sorcerers, rather than acquired through research and study, so sorcerers can cast any [[Spell|spell]] they know without needing to study and prepare each spell prior to casting. Because sorcerers need not develop the focus and concentration that comes from study and preparation, however, sorcerers are generally more limited in the number of spells they can comprehend and memorize, or that they can cast before exhausting their reservoir of magical energy.
> Additionally, many sorcerers develop early the ability to cast spells without using the consumable [[Material component|material components]] that most [[Wizard|wizards]] require for successful spellcasting.


### Bloodlines and bloodline abilities

***Main article: [[Bloodline]]***
> Sorcerer's magical abilities derive from their bloodline, a taxonomic term for identifying the inherited source of such abilities. At least 20 independent bloodlines are widely known to exist across [[Golarion]], most involving a progenitor of highly advanced magical ability or belonging to an magical or extraplanar race. Some theorize that a few regions may have additional bloodlines native to and largely confined to such regions.
> What is widely accepted, however, is that as the sorcerer gradually gains mastery over her magical abilities, she may learn spells, gain supernatural powers and spell-like abilities, and sometimes even manifest physiological characteristics reflecting the historical source of her inherited power. Sorcerers claiming an aquatic bloodline, for example, have demonstrated a marked affinity for water-based magic, and there are verifiable accounts of such aquatic sorcerers whose very bodies have developed abilities to withstand the cold and pressure of a deep-water environment.


### Combat

> Whether because the time, focus, and dedication required for magical mastery leaves the sorcerer with little time for physical development or combat training, or simply because the sorcerer learns to rely on her powers rather than force of arms, most sorcerers are capable of using only the simplest [[Weapon|weapons]], and even those with little proficiency. Additionally, encumbering [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] and [[Shield|shields]] make it difficult if not impossible for the sorcerer to make the gestures and other body movements necessary for successful spellcasting. While it is not unheard-of for an adventuring sorcerer to undertake some combat training during the course of her career, many surround themselves with companions or hirelings to take care of hands-on defense and protection while the sorcerer relies on offensive and defensive spellcasting—from a safe distance.
> The sorcerer's spellcasting flexibility and reliance on a small selection of favored spells makes her highly valued as a battle mage.


## On Golarion

> Sorcerers can be found, with greater or lesser relative frequency, in nearly every inhabited part of [[Golarion]]. Sorcerers are very common on the island of [[Hermea]], where pervasive social engineering by the [[Gold dragon|gold dragon]] [[Mengkare]] nurtures the development of arcane abilities. Nations and regions such as [[Geb's Rest]], [[Nex]], [[Sarkoris]], [[Varisia]], and the [[Worldwound]] tend to produce sorcerers more frequently than their neighbors, possibly owing to the influence of centuries of magic in those areas.
> In [[Rahadoum]], where deific worship is illegal, [[Divine|divine]] sorcerers are viewed with suspicion and distaste.

## Races

> Sorcerers may come from nearly any race or species, although some species may be more or less likely to produce sorcerers owing to their degree of interaction with the sorcerous creatures that are believed to spawn sorcerer bloodlines, or simple evolutionary adaptation. [[Dwarf|Dwarves]], for example, tend to possess markedly less affinity for arcane magic than most other races, while among [[Varisian]] [[Human|humans]], sorcery is more common, due to their connection with the magic-rich traditions of ancient [[Thassilon]].
> [[Gnome]], [[Goblin|goblin]], [[Catfolk|catfolk]], [[Kobold|kobold]], [[Azarketi|azarketi]], [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], [[Changeling|changeling]], [[Dhampir|dhampir]], [[Tiefling|tiefling]], [[Beastkin|beastkin]], [[Fetchling|fetchling]], [[Sylph|sylph]], [[Undine|undine]], [[Kitsune|kitsune]], and [[Anadi|anadi]] [[Adventurer|adventurers]] often become sorcerers.
> Among some races, certain [[Bloodline|bloodlines]] are more common than others—for example, [[Changeling|changeling]] sorcerers are almost always of the [[Hag|hag]] bloodline. 


## Religion

> Sorcerers might be inspired to worship [[Shelyn]], the goddess of [[Art|art]] and love; [[Desna]], the goddess of luck and travel; or even [[Cayden Cailean]], the god of freedom and [[Alcoholic beverages|alcohol]]. Devotion might be woven into their self-expression, or it could provide a connection to like-minded followers, or give them a deeper sense of purpose.
