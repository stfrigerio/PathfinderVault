***[[The Choosing]]***

**Written by** [[Ron Lundeen]]

**Expected** April 26, 2023


A vision of a strange shop in the [[Grand Bazaar]] of [[Absalom]] accompanies the unexpected arrival of powerful [[Magic|magic]] cards that mysteriously manifest in the possession of a band of [[Adventurer|adventurers]]. But when an investigation of this vision reveals murder, treachery, and [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] machinations, the adventurers are thrown into a race to control the very future of all things to come, tied to the ubiquitous fortune-telling cards known as the [[Harrow]]! Who has chosen your characters for this deadly quest, and what might become of your destinies should you fail?

***[[The Destiny War]]***

**Written by** [[Chris S Sims]]

**Expected** May 24, 2023


More scattered cards of the mysterious and powerful [[Harrow deck]] known as the Deck of Destiny must be gathered before those who would use the Harrow's power to alter fate itself for their own needs can get them first. But this time, the cards come to the heroes when one of their competitors grows aggressive and attacks them in their own home. Only by gathering allies, exploring an ancient ruin, and exploring a corrupted [[Demiplane|demiplane]] can the heroes stand a chance over their latest enemyâ€”a demonic mercenary who's taken an apocryphal Harrow card as his own identity.

***[[The Worst of All Possible Worlds]]***

**Written by** [[Luis Loza]]

**Expected** June 28, 2023


The final cards of a powerful [[Artifact|artifact]] based on the legendary [[Harrow]] deck finally lie within the grasp of the heroes who seek to defend the very future of reality from being set in stone, but fate itself has its own plans. Will the heroes of Stolen Fate make their own way into an unknown future and clash against the very creators of this potent magical artifact, or is destiny truly a force that cannot be withstood?
