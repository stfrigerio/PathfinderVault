> **Nesh** is the mountainous [[Abyssal realm]] of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Zura]]. Within the mountains, a long valley contains a spectrum of environments, moving gradually from cold to warm: snowy peaks and glaciated valleys; woodlands and moor; jungles and swamps. It is always nighttime in Nesh, and the sky has an alarming similarity to the night sky of [[Golarion]].
> Duped [[Mortal|mortals]] live in Nesh believing it to be in their [[Material Plane]] [[Planet|world]], and only the [[Evil|evil]] village leaders are aware that they are actually in the [[Abyss]]. In a similarly sadistic way to the hunts of [[Jezelda]]'s [[Moonbog]], favourites of Zura are allowed to hunt these frightened [[Humanoid|humanoids]] within the realm.
