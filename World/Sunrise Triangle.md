> **Sunrise Triangle** is home to, and takes it name from, the second largest tent bazaar in [[Ular Kel]], after the more famous market of [[The Crossway]]. Here, buyers can find a huge variety of items from exotic fruits to strange [[Weapon|weapons]] and, as the market closest to the [[Gate of Grass]], sometimes even genuine relics from distant [[Kaladay]].
