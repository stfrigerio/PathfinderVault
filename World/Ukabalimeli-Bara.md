> The **Ukabalimeli-Bara** is a large region of the town of [[Elokolobha]], located far to the east, in the boundary of the [[Screaming Jungle]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. It is the territory of the [[Graveborn tribe]], led by [[Ukabalimeli|Ukabalimeli the Manslayer]], which is one of the [[Eloko]] tribes that inhabit the town. Perhaps the oldest part of the city, Ukabalimeli-Bara contains half-carved towers, temples, bridges, and barricades. The most impressive of these structures is [[Eastblock]], a massive wedge of carved stone. Inside its hollow walls, a 1,000-foot-tall staircase permits entrance to the city without the need to climb the dangerous crags. Other important structures in Ukabalimeli-Bara are the Temple of Withering, the Fallen Gate, and a massive tower called Coldblock.
