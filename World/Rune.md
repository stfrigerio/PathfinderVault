> **Runes** are letterforms in some languages' alphabets, and have especially strong associations with [[Dwarven]] (shared from [[Terran]]), [[Thassilonian]] and its derivative languages (such as [[Giant language|Giant]], [[Shoanti language|Shoanti]], and [[Varisian language|Varisian]]), some [[Elven]] cultures, and related traditions.
The ancient empire of [[Thassilon]] placed particular importance on runes, and its founder and first king [[Xin]] innovated rune magic from bargaining with ancient creatures such as [[Dragon|dragons]] and [[Outsider|outsiders]], as well as the worship of [[Lissala]], [[God|goddess]] of runes.
