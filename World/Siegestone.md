> The ***Siegestone*** of the town of [[Trunau]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]], is a [[Magic|magical]] cauldron-like altar, which could produce many gallons of a tasteless porridge, keeping the residents alive in times of trouble. It resides in the [[Longhouse]], among the other town's supplies, and is never used except in direst need.
