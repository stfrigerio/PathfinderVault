> The **Rose Quarter** is one of the sixteen city districts of [[Sothis]] located immediately east of the [[Old City]] in 'lower' Sothis. To the north and east are rich, peripheral districts—[[Marblecourt]], [[Grand Oasis]], [[The Palms]] and [[Peacock Square]]— while to the south is the [[Scorpion Road]] district. Despite its proximity to wealthy districts, the Rose Quarter is a seat of illicit trade. It differs in atmosphere considerably from the frenetic [[Malhitu Bazaar]] in the neighbouring Old City district though: here life takes on a slower pace.

a famous curio shop that is very popular with desert explorers: it is full of relics of [[Ancient Osirion]] nearly rivalling the [[Sothis Exhibitory]], but handles all transactions with utter discretion asking no questions.
