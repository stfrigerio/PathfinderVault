> A party of [[Gray Gardeners]] were taking Toothy Morris, one of [[Galt|Galts]] infamous [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Artifacts/Minor Artifacts/Final blade|Final Blades]], from [[Edme]] to [[Isarn]] when they were attacked by [[Giant|giants]] and Toothy Morris was taken.
> A [[Frost giant|frost giant]] [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]] called Jorngarl took the blade from the guillotine and attached it to an [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]] haft to form a rudimentary giant-sized [[Greataxe|greataxe]] that came to be known as ***Jorngarl's Harm***.
> It has the [[Vorpal weapon|vorpal weapon]] quality, but also retains the property of the final blade it was made from; anyone killed by it has their [[Soul|soul]] trapped and cannot be resurrected. The Gray Gardeners are able to free souls trapped by the final blades, so presumably they could free a soul trapped by the axe. The axe laughs when it kills.
> The axe is currently in the possession of a frost giant called [[Bjarlsfarn|Bjarlsfarn the Bloody]], who lives in the [[Fog Peaks]] and leads raids into [[Galt]] and [[Taldor]]. The Gray Gardeners would love to reclaim Toothy Morris, but all their attempts to date have failed.
