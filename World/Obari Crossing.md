> The **Obari Crossing** is an ocean-going trade route that connects the [[Inner Sea region]] with the distant nations bordering the [[Obari Ocean]] on the continent of [[Casmaron]] and the sub-continent of [[Vudra]]. The route begins in [[Katapesh]] and moves east past the island nation of [[Jalmeray]] to the western coast of [[Qadira]]. There, it turns south and heads out across the open ocean, passing the southern satrapies of the [[Empire of Kelesh|Keleshite Empire]] and the island archipelago of [[Iblydos]], including its westernmost city of [[Aelyosos]], before ending in Vudra. Even though the route is highly profitable, it is also highly dangerous: violent weather in the Obari Ocean is common, as are countless terrible sea creatures, ambitious [[Pirate|pirates]], the [[Jalmeri]] navy, and the treasure-hunting [[Brine dragon|brine dragon]] Brisaswaithe.
> Merchants who ply the Obari Crossing often carry a vast range of luxury goods, particularly spices, [[Weapon|weapons]], and [[Magical beast|magical beasts]] from sources spanning from [[Tian Xia]], to Vudra, to [[Garund]].
