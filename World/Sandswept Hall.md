> **Sandswept Hall**, sometimes called **Sothis Lodge**, is the [[Pathfinder lodge]] in the [[Osirion|Osirian]] capital of [[Sothis]]. It is a converted jail that the [[Pathfinder Society]] rents cells out both to private customers, as well as the government to hold city prisoners; the lodge also has a side-line in bounty hunting. The walls of the compound contain the two-storey main structure, underground vaults, and gardens. The current [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] is [[Norden Balentiir]].



## Gardens

> The gardens housed inside the walls of the lodge are designed to be a place of tranquillity amidst the bustle of the city of Sothis. They contain date palms, sycamores, and tamarisk; a variety of grapevines and hanging plants are also growing on latticework. There are also two aqueduct-fed pools just outside of the garden from which the Pathfinders draw their water.


## Main building

> The main building of the lodge is a two-storey structure built out of white limestone blocks with copper-reinforced, wooden doors. Statues of two [[Sphinx|sphinxes]] flank the entryway.


## Personnel

> The lodge's record keeper is [[Aygrim Bossell]], a largely senile Pathfinder kept on out of mercy by the venture-captain.
