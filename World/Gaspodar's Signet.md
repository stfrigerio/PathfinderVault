> **Gaspodar's signet ring** still encircles the severed finger of the long dead [[Gaspodar|King Gaspodar]]. Clipped from the hand of the dead king of [[Cheliax]], both ring and finger are preserved in a small glass jar of honey that is sealed with solder. The ring has a thick gold band, etched into the inside of which is an [[Azlanti]] phrase that reads "Hail [[Aroden]], Bringer of the Age of Glory." The ring's bezel is engraved with the seal of Cheliax. The craftmanship of the signet is extremely intricate, making its duplication almost impossible.
> It is believed that the Gaspodar's Signet is still kept as a blasphemous trophy somewhere inside the [[Midnight Temple]], the [[Asmodeus|Asmodean]] temple in [[Egorian]]. The Gaspodar's Signet is a potent political tool sought both by the Chelish government and the [[House of Thrune]]'s enemies.
