> ***The Bones Land in a Spiral*** is the holy book of [[Pharasma]]; it is sometimes referred to as ***Bones Fall in a Spiral***. This work was written in several parts. The first part consists of vague, debatable predictions by an ancient prophet. The prophesies are inconclusive and esoteric, allowing a cunning reader to fit specific parts of the text to any number of situations, past or future.
> Later additions discuss childbirth, burial rites, and the prevention of [[Undeath|undeath]].
