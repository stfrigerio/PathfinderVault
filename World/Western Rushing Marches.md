> The **Western Rushing Marches** are a large swath of land in the [[Moda Prefecture|Moda]] prefecture in the nation of [[Taldor]]. The region is administered by an earl and the traditional custodians of the land are the Merkondus family.
> The people of these lands are mostly fisherfolk and peat-cutters with little other industry to speak of. Rumours say that the citizenry are willing to house smugglers and even revolutionaries from time to time, and incessantly grumble about the taxes they pay to their liege lords.
