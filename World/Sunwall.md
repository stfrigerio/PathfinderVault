> The **Sunwall** was a great line of uniform fortresses that stretched across the open plains of the land now known as the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. The fortresses were constructed after the defeat of [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] at the end of the [[Shining Crusade]] in [[3828 AR]] to protect against any further threat that might emerge from the desolate northern lands. The Sunwall held back the rampaging hordes of [[Orcs|orcs]] for four hundred years before it finally fell to them in [[4237 AR]]. Now it remains only as a series of abandoned fortifications some of which have been taken over by the very orcs they were meant to defend against.
> The series of fortresses were stretching from the [[Mindspin Mountains]] in the west to the [[Gap of Valballus]] in the east, where they joined with Ustalav's defensive line of [[Bleakwall]]. The fortresses were placed at intervals of 15 miles (the distance an armored soldier can travel on foot in a day).
