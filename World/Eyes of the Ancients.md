> The **Eyes of the Ancients** are the three biggest and most famous storms on [[Bretheda]], located in its southern hemisphere. Tens of thousands of miles wide, they are big enough to be visible from [[Golarion]] with a telescope. They form a perfect equilateral triangle and appeared in historical records [[1606 AR|exactly three millennia]] before the formation of the [[Eye of Abendego]] on Golarion, leading to numerous speculation about their true nature.
