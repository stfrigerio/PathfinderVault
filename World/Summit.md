> The **Summit** is the highest peak of [[Heaven]] and is only few square miles in size. The location has no lord and no residents aside from the occasional [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioner]]. Such visitors never arrive at the same time.
> Beyond the transient spirits, only one thing exists there: the round walls and open, broken gate of a small garden at the center of the Summit. This location is known as the [[Garden Heaven|Garden]] after which the topmost tier of Heaven is named.
