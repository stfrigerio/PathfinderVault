> **Sholay** is a huge pool of magma that sits in the lower southern foothills of the [[Lohaparbat Mountains]] in the [[Falling Mountains]] region of the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]]. The mechanical god [[Dhuangir]] is said to lie buried beneath this stretch of mountains and Sholay is the result of his [[Duergar|duergar]] followers' attempt to excavate parts of Dhuangir from beneath the mountains.
