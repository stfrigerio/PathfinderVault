 Zyphus' [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]].
> The ***Letters of Harsh Truth*** is a book collecting the revelations about the folly of the [[Deity|gods]], the dominance of chance, and how [[Mortals|mortals]] should accept their inevitable and random deaths, including specific responses to various mortal sufferings, like the death of a loved one, loss of a limb, blindness, and the like. The book was an original creation by a [[Zyphen]] [[Priest|priest]] using automatic writing, which other priests will quote verbatim for the attack letters they send to strangers.
