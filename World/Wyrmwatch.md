> Both a functioning lighthouse and a tribute to [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] founder [[Alcaydian Indros]] the **Wyrmwatch**, or **Wyrmwatch Tower**, is a one of the city's most prominent landmarks. The Wyrmwatch sits at the western most edge of [[Outcast's Cove|Outcasts Cove]] at the very tip of [[Beacon's Point|Beacons Point]] jutting out into the [[Varisian Gulf]] warning ships away from the dangerous spur of rock and welcomes them to the busy harbour of the [[Dockway]] and the [[Bazaar of Sails]]. It supposedly sits upon the very site where Alcaydian Indros slew the mighty [[Dragon|Sea Dragon]] known as [[Vydrarch]] which was one of the events that lead to the founding of Magnimar.
