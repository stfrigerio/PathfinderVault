# Wand Cane

**Item 4**

> Though it appears to be a basic cane, the inner workings of the *wand cane* are an intricate network of lenses and magical circuits, with a slot at the top to insert a [[Wand]]. The *wand cane* then spends 1 minute attuning to the wand, after which the wand can be used through the cane.
