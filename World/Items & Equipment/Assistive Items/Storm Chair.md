**Item 14**

> This traveler's chair uses magic and Stasian technology, storing up power in its Stasian coils to arc lightning through your foes and grant brief spurts of flight.

**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You create a ball of electricity around the chair, surrounding it in a damaging aura of electricity and using electromagnetism to briefly levitate. For 1 minute, you gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed and adjacent creatures that hit you with a melee attack, as well as creatures that touch or hit you with an [[Unarmed]] attack, take 2d6 electricity damage each time. As normal, this applies to creatures who choose to touch you, not when you touch or attack another creature.
