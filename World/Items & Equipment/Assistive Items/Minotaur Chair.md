# Minotaur Chair

**Item 9**

> A *minotaur chair* is a [[Traveler's Chair]] with [[Chair Storage]], *[[Impulse Control]]*, and *+1 [[Striking]] [[Wounding]] [[Nethys/Assistive Items/Wheel Spikes]]*. The *wheel spikes* can have runes upgraded, transferred, or added as normal. The chair magically stores the kinetic energy from movement throughout the day, allowing you to expend it to make a powerful rushing charge.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You rush forward with the wheelchair in a powerful charge, bowling through foes who stand in the way. Stride in a straight line, moving through enemies' spaces and making an attack with the wheel spikes against every foe in the line. If the foe is [[Prone]], the following effects apply: the attack gains a +1 circumstance bonus to damage per weapon damage die, and the *wounding* rune deals 1d12 [[Persistent Bleed Damage]] on a hit (or 3d6 persistent bleed damage on a critical hit).
