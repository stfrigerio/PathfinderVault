# Guide Harness

**Item 1**

> The grip of this guide harness fits comfortably in the hand. Guide harnesses are purpose-built for low-sight or blind adventurers who have guide animals. Usually fastened with side straps placed through a martingale, guide harnesses can be easily reconfigured to allow them to be worn by any animal companion.
