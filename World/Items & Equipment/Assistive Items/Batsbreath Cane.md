# Batsbreath Cane

**Item 10**

> A specialized *+1 [[Striking]] [[Thundering]] [[Nethys/Assistive Items/Probing Cane]]* made from strengthened spruce wood, a *batsbreath cane* is distinctive for its brass tip. The tip covers a small hollow in the wood that houses quartz crystals infused with latent storm magic.

*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You strike the cane firmly against the ground, causing a pin within the brass tip to tap the crystals and emit a sonic pulse. The pulse reverberates in a 60-foot radius for the next minute, with the cane acting as an antenna to receive the echoes. For 1 minute, as long as you remain in the area and are holding the cane, you gain hearing as a [[Precise Sense]].
