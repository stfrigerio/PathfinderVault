# Falconsight Eye

**Item 6**

> This prosthetic eye resembles that of a bird of prey. Along with the abilities of the *[[Magical Prosthetic Eye]]*, it allows you to strike foes at greater range and with impressive accuracy.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You become keenly aware of your foes, even those seemingly out of reach. For 1 minute, you can close your eyes as a free action to see through a ranged weapon you're wielding, which reduces the penalty for firing into your weapon's second [[Range Increment]] from –2 to 0. This effect doesn't negate the [[Blinded]] condition.

```
