# Reading Ring

**Item 1+**

>  *Reading rings* are small magic items that can be crafted into any design the wearer pleases and worn on any finger. They're made using a variety of materials, such as metal or wood, and are imbued with minor divination magic. These rings assist [[Blind]] and low-vision wearers in reading books, tomes, and other such forms of writing, needing only to run the finger or hand wearing the ring over the pages to hear what's written on the page in their mind.If the user is deafblind, the ring will instead translate the writing into tactile sign or another method for the user to glean the writing's meaning.A *reading ring* is personalized to its user and capable of reading only languages in which the user is fluent. Each ring is unique and can't be used by anyone other than its specific bonded user. A *reading ring* is bonded to its user in a process that taps into the user's inner potential, similar to an [[Invested]] item, except the process takes 10 minutes, is permanent, and doesn't count toward your number of invested items. You can wear the ring in various ways, often either on a finger or a chain worn about your person if you can't have it on a digit. You can use the *reading ring* to read text by taking an Interact action, and you read with the ring at roughly the same rate as a visual reader. There is no limit to how often you can use the ring to read in this manner.
