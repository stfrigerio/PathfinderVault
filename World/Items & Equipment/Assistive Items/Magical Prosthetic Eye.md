# Magical Prosthetic Eye

**Item 1**

> This prosthetic eye converts visible light into a telepathic signal that is relayed to the wearer's mind using divination magic. As the wearer's mind must process the telepathic signal in the same way as it would a nerve impulse, the acuity and other abilities related to the vision provided by the *magical prosthetic eye* matches that of other members of your ancestry (for instance, a [[Goblin]] with a magical prosthetic eye would be able to see in [[Darkvision]], while a [[Human]] wearing the same prosthetic would need illumination). You can remove or replace a *magical prosthetic eye* using an Interact action.
