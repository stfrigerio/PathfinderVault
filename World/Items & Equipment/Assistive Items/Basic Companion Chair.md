# Basic Companion Chair

**Item 0**

>  [[Light Barding]] around the torso connects via struts to a number of wheels to assist animal companions' movement. Companion chairs can be fitted for animal companions of any shape or size and have two- and four-wheel configurations depending on the level of physical support needed. Like the [[Basic Chair]], a companion chair is ideal for everyday use but not more strenuous activity, making it more common among non-adventurers.
