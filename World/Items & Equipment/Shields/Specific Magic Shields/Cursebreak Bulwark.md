# Cursebreak Bulwark

**Item 17**

> This [[Tower Shield]] (Hardness 14, HP 56, BT 28) is composed of interlocking hexagonal wooden tiles lined with metal. The tiles are painted a verdant green, and each is marked with a faded rune that protects against curses. While you have this shield raised, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells that target you, increasing to a +2 circumstance bonus against [[Curses]]. You can unleash the energy stored in the shield to destroy a curse before it can affect you.
