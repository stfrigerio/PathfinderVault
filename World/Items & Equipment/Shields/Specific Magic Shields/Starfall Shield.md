# Starfall Shield

**Item 19**

> This [[High-Grade Adamantine]] [[Heavy Rondache]] (Hardness 17, HP  100, BT 50) bears a *+3 [[Greater Striking]] [[Shield Boss]]* and has dents that resemble craters on its surface. While wielding the shield, you have fire resistance 15.

title: **Activate**
*â¬½{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You Stride up to three times. This movement doesn't trigger reactions and ignores difficult terrain. At the end of your movement, you deal 6d10 bludgeoning damage in a 10-foot emanation and 14d6 fire damage in a 40-foot emanation (DC 40 [[Basic]] Reflex save, with the results applying to both the bludgeoning and fire damage). The space where you end your movement and all adjacent spaces become difficult terrain for 1 minute, and the shield glows red-hot for 10 minutes, during which it gains the effect of the *[[Greater Flaming]]* property rune.
