# Nethysian Bulwark

**Item 16**

> This round shield is often fashioned to resemble the religious symbol of its dual-natured namesake. A *Nethysian bulwark* is a [[High-Grade Cold Iron]] [[Shield]] (Hardness 10, HP 40, BT 20) that defends the wielder and can explode with retributive force when struck.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â­“{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Trigger**: The shield becomes broken when performing a [[Shield Block]] ;
**Effect**: The shield explodes in a burst of bright light and shadowy tendrils, releasing a 15-foot cone of force that must include the attacker if possible. The cone deals 6d8 force damage to all creatures in the area (DC 34 basic Reflex save).
