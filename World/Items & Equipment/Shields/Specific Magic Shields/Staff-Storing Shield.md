# Staff-Storing Shield

**Item 7+**

> This magically reinforced [[Wooden Shield]] (Hardness 6, HP 36, BT 18) normally has a blank face. It can absorb a [[Staff]] and transform between a shield and staff. When you prepare a staff, you can hold it up to the shield, at which point the items will merge, and the shield's face becomes an image corresponding to the type of magic, such as a skull for a *[[Staff Of Necromancy]]*.

```ad-embed-ability

**Effect**: You change the *staff-storing shield* from its shield form into the stored staff, which has an image of the shield on it, or change it from the stored staff back into a shield.
