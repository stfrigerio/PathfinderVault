# Forge Warden

**Item 10**

> The religious symbol of [[Torag]], the forge god—an ornate hammer of dwarven construction—adorns the face of this reinforced [[Steel Shield]] (Hardness 10, HP 40, BT 20). The shield is a [[Religious Symbol]] of Torag.You and any adjacent allies have fire resistance 5 while you have the shield raised. When used for a [[Shield Block]], the *forge warden* rings out like the hammer strike of a blacksmith, and the symbol glows as if lit by the fires of a furnace.
