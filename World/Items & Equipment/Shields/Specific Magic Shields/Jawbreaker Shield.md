# Jawbreaker Shield

**Item 12**

> This heavy bone shield is composed of a massive plate of dinosaur bone with jagged, tooth-like ridges ringing its edge. It has Hardness 12, HP 48, and BT 24. The ridges are unremovable *+1 striking [[Shield Spikes]]* that deal slashing damage instead of piercing damage. While holding the *jawbreaker shield* , you gain a +3 item bonus to your Reflex DC to resist [[Swallow Whole]] attacks.

**Trigger**: A creature attacks you with a jaws or fangs Strike or similar Strike using its mouth;
**Effect**: You make a shield bash Strike as a reaction against the attacker. If the shield bash hits, the target takes damage and must attempt a DC 31 Fortitude saving throw. The effects of the saving throw are determined after the effects of the triggering Strike are resolved.
