# Silkspinner's Shield

**Item 15**

> This oddly fuzzy [[Buckler]] (Hardness 10, HP 60, BT 30) resembles the abdomen of a spider. Its defensive side is covered in fine hairs, and two small spinnerets protrude from the bottom of its rim. The spinnerets serve as *+2 [[Greater Striking]] [[Shield Spikes]]*.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Command; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You animate the *silkspinner's shield*. Eight spider legs sprout from the shield's rim, granting you a climb Speed of 25 feet until the end of your next turn. Additionally, the spinnerets animate and produce silk for 1 minute. Successful shield bash Strikes made with the *silkspinner's shield* during this time entangle the target in silk. The target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. If your Strike was a critical hit, the target becomes [[Immobilized]] for 1 round instead. Regardless, the target can attempt to [[Escape]] (DC 30) to end the effect early.
