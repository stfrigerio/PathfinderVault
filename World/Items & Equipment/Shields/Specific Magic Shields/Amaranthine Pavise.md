# Amaranthine Pavise

**Item 10**

> This [[Tower Shield]] (Hardness 9, HP 54, BT 27) was developed by followers of [[Ketephys]], the elven god of the hunt. It's distinct for having a central ridge, and for being made from only wood and hide. Ketephys's religious symbol, a hawk rising over a silver crescent, is painted on the hide stretched across the front of the shield. Each *amaranthine pavise* is blessed by Ketephysian priests to aid in liberating Tanglebriar and defeating the nascent demon lord [[Treerazer]]. While you have the shield raised, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against the innate spells and special abilities of [[Demons]]. When your allies have cover from the *amaranthine pavise* , the circumstance bonus they gain from cover to Reflex saves against area effects also applies to Fortitude and Will saves against demons' area effects.
