# Shining Shield

**Item 10**

> Kalabrynne Iomedar commissioned the first of these shields, which have become some of the Shining Sentinels' most valued equipment, replicated among these knights. A shining shield is a seemingly simple [[Wooden Shield]] (Hardness 6, HP 24, BT 12) with the Shining Oath engraved on the inside.While raised, a *shining shield* moves itself to provide cover for your allies. If you have this shield raised and would provide [[Cover]] to an ally against a foe by standing between them, the cover you provide increases one step. Thus, if you were to grant lesser cover, you grant standard cover instead; if you were to grant standard cover, you instead grant greater cover.
