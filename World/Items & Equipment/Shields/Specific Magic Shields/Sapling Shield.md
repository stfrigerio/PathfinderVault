# Sapling Shield

**Item 3+**

> This surprisingly weighty, though well-balanced, wooden [[Buckler]] is emblazoned with the image of a sapling. The sapling withers as the shield takes damage.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Effect**: The buckler expands, with the sapling image growing into a mighty oak tree. The buckler becomes a [[Tower Shield]], gaining the corresponding AC bonus, Speed penalty, and ability to [[Take Cover]]. It keeps the same Hit Points and Broken Threshold, but its Hardness and Bulk increase by 2 in this form. The shield remains in this form until you Activate it again to revert it to a buckler.
