# Indestructible Shield

**Item 18**

> An *indestructible shield* is a [[High-Grade Adamantine]] [[Shield]] (Hardness 13, HP 90) that can withstand just about any damage. It can be damaged only by a *[[Disintegrate]]* spell (roll damage as if against a creature that failed its save) or by an artifact tied to destruction, such as a *[[Sphere of Annihilation]]*.
**Craft Requirements**: The raw materials must include at least 4,400 gp of adamantine.
