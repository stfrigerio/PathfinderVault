# Floating Shield

**Item 11+**

> A *floating shield* is usually carved with wing motifs. This [[Buckler]] (Hardness 6, HP 24, BT 12) can protect you on its own.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: The shield magically releases itself and floats off your arm into the air next to you, granting you its bonus automatically, as if you had [[Raised The Shield]]. Because you’re not wielding the shield, you can’t use reactions such as [[Shield Block]] with the shield, but you gain its benefits even when using both of your hands. After 1 minute, the shield drops to the ground, ending its floating effect. While the shield is adjacent to you, you can Interact to grasp it, ending its floating effect early.

```
