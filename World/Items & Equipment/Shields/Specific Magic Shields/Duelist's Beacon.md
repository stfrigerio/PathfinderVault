# Duelist's Beacon

**Item 8**

> A spiked glove is attached to the front of this [[Buckler]] (Hardness 6, HP 24, BT 12), functioning as *+1 [[Striking]] [[Shield Spikes]]*. Perforations and slits line the defensive side, shining bright light through them when the item's magic is activated.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You activate the shield's inner light. Attempt a melee Strike with the *duelist's beacon*. On a hit, the target must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be [[Blinded]] for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target uses the result one degree of success worse than it rolled for its Fortitude save.

```
