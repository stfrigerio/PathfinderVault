# Pillow Shield

**Item 4**

> The shield's blue enameled face is cool to the touch, and displays the moon's current phase at night. When you lay your head on the reverse side of this [[Steel Shield]] (Hardness 6, HP 36, BT 18), it becomes as pliant and supportive as the best pillows. If you complete a period of rest using the *pillow shield* , you can choose to transfer your recovery to the shield. Instead of [[Recovering A Number Of Hit Points After Resting]], the shield is restored an equal number of Hit Points instead.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* command, envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: The shield creates an area of vigilance. It casts *[[Alarm]]* centered on itself; you decide whether it creates a mental alarm or an audible alarm. The alarm goes off at the end of the spell's duration or when triggered as normal, whichever comes first.
