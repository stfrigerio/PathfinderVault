# Lion's Shield

**Item 6**

> This [[Steel Shield]] (Hardness 6, HP 36, BT 18) is forged into the shape of a roaring lion’s head. The lion’s head functions as *+1 striking [[Shield Boss]]* that can’t be removed from the shield.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Raise a Shield; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You animate the lion’s head. You [[Raise The Shield]] and make a melee Strike with it as part of the same action. The shield’s biting maw is a martial melee weapon that deals 2d6 piercing damage and has the deadly 1d6 trait; it can’t be enhanced by runes. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, during which time you can Strike with it each time you Raise the Shield, as well as with a Strike action.
