# Harnessed Shield

> This large steel shield features a specialized opening to hold lances and similar weapons. Harnessed shields are a common backup for those who fight with [[Jousting]] weapons in case they're forced into combat without their mounts. Balancing the weapon within the shield's hold is somewhat awkward, and longer weapons, like [[Lances]], need to be held closer to the body than usual for proper support.
