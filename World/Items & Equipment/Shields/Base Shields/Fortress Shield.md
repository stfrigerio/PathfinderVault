# Fortress Shield

**Item 1**

> Also known as portable walls, these thick and heavy shields are slightly larger than [[Tower Shields]]. Like tower shields, they're typically made from wood reinforced with metal, but many are made from larger amounts of metal or even stone.2

Getting the higher bonus for a fortress shield requires using the [[Take Cover]] action while the shield is raised.
