# Abysium Shield

**Item 8+**

> These glowing shields are crafted to ensure that the abysium used is safely contained within a durable outer shell. If the shield breaks, however, the toxic metal becomes exposed. When you use the [[Shield Block]] reaction against an adjacent creature's melee Strike, if the shield breaks, the creature is exposed to the abysium and is [[Sickened 1]] for a standard-grade shield or sickened 2 for a high-grade shield.
