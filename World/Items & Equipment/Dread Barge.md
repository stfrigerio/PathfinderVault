> **Dread Barges** are used by the [[Demon|demons]] in [[Worldwound]] to ply the [[Sarkora River]] between [[Undarin]] and [[Storasta]], carrying [[Humanoid|humanoids]] and supplies, but also as mobile platforms for siege engines. They are elaborate constructions of half-organic shapes and textures, usually operated by [[Babau|babau]] tillers and numerous humanoid [[Slave|slaves]] who pole or row the barge along. Sometimes plagued [[Aurochs|aurochs]] or other unholy beasts are used to move the barges up river. It is said that many of the Dread Barges have been transformed into colossal [[Animated object|animated objects]].
