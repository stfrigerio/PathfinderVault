> ***Totems of Angazhan*** are [[Intelligent item|intelligent]] [[Minor artifact|minor artifacts]] found in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] that can defend themselves with [[Magic|magic]] and promote the will of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Angazhan]]. Creatures that die near a *totem of Angazhan* and are willing to sell their [[Soul|souls]] to Angazhan can accept an offer to be *reincarnated*; most such creatures come back as a [[Charau-ka|charau-ka]], although once every year, the *totem* can choose to bring a creature back as a [[Gorilla King]], who is immediately infused with a desire to seek out the incumbent Gorilla King and challenge him to a duel to the death over the position.
> Originally, only a single *totem of Angazhan* existed, until the expansion of the Gorilla King's reach caused more to appear in various hidden parts of the Mwangi Expanse, especially to the south of the [[Screaming Jungle]], in uncharted central [[Garund]].
