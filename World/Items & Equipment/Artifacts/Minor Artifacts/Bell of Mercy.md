> Dedicated to the faith of [[Desna]] seven bell towers are believed to have existed at one point throughout the [[Inner Sea]]. The seven towers represented the Seven Towers of Desna's palace and each tower housed a sacred ***Bell of Mercy***. Pilgrimages to all seven towers were often undertaken by Desna's faithful. The seven bells are located in the western [[Mierani Forest]] of [[Varisia]], the [[Hungry Mountains]] of [[Ustalav]], the ruined city of [[Kokutang]] in the [[Sodden Lands]], the eastern reaches of [[Tanglebriar]] in [[Kyonin]], a hidden cove on [[Warlock Island]] in [[Cheliax]], somewhere in the hills south of [[White Canyon]] in [[Katapesh]], and in an old fort in the eastern [[Stonewilds]] in the [[Worldwound]].
> The *Bell of Mercy* magic works only once per year, sanctifying the whole area within a radius of 120 feet around the bell. Amongst its powers, non-good or non-chaotic creatures suffer a great deal of damage and evil extraplanar creatures, without exceptional will strength, are banished to their plane of origin.
> A *Bell of Mercy* may be destroyed by transporting it to the [[Abyss]] and there striking it with an *adamantine unholy sword*.
