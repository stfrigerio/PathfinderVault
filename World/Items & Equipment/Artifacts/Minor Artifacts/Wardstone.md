> A ***wardstone*** is a [[Minor artifact|minor artifact]] in the form of a menhir inscribed with [[Rune|runes]], and is designed to ward out [[Demon|demons]] of the [[Worldwound]]. Its power must be maintained by regular prayers and annual [[Ritual|rituals]]. The *wardstones* are infused with the rare mineral nexovar, found in the hills along the [[Egelsee River]] in [[Mendev]], which helps to combat the demonic taint.



## History

> The first *wardstone* was erected in [[4639 AR]] in the Kite in [[Kenabres]]. This required a ritual which occurred under the guidance of [[Hand of the Inheritor|Iomedaes herald]].
> A string of fortresses were established on the border between Mendev and the Worldwound after the [[Second Mendevian Crusade]]. Each fortress is named after a dead crusader general, and contains a *wardstone*. The greatest of these fortresses is [[Clydwell Keep]], which houses the *[[Demonscope]]*, the artifact which powers the *wardstones*. It is guarded by the [[Order of Holy Sentinels]].


## Abilities

> Creatures of intrinsically [[Chaos|chaotic]] or [[Evil|evil]] nature cannot pass between *wardstones*; thus they serve to ensure the demons of the Worldwound cannot venture into Mendev. However, these obelisks must be continuously maintained by priests and protected from demonic attack.
> The *wardstones* also prevent any form of [[Teleportation|teleportation]] [[Magic|magic]] from functioning across the borders, whether from a demonic source or otherwise, but do not hinder such magic from functioning normally inside the Worldwound. Their effects are powerful enough to weaken demonic excursions to the unwarded western and northern borders.


## Destruction

> Should a *wardstones* go more than a year without a maintenance ritual, it can be damaged as any other object, though it remains a dense and difficult to break stone. Destroying a *wardstone* breaks its link in the chain of *wardstones*, though the gap in its effect can vary between a few dozen feet to several miles in length.
