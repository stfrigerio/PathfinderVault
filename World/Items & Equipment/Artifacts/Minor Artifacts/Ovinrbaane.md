> ***Ovinrbaane, Enemy of All Enemies***, is a powerful, intelligent, but [[Cursed item|cursed]] [[Greatsword|greatsword]] once wielded by the [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarian]] warlord [[Armag]], leader of the [[Tiger Lords]] tribe and follower of [[Gorum]]. Infused with the warlike spirit of its former wielder, the blade seeks only war and conflict. It protects its wielder from hostile [[Magic|magic]] and, it is said, infuses the wielder with a portion of Armag's legendary power.


## History

> For many years, Armag led his warriors to victory, proclaiming himself invincible and pridefully declaring himself Gorum's champion. While Gorum was amused by his boastfulness, [[Pharasma]] was insulted, and sent [[Aeon|aeons]] to defeat him. Gorum took offense, resulting in a battle of wits between the two [[Deities|deities]]. When Armag was finally felled in battle, Gorum infused Armag's [[Soul|soul]] into his blade, thereby forbidding Armag's soul to enter the [[Boneyard]]. He then sent word to Armag's tribe to inter the body and equipment in a great tomb filled with guardians, traps, and tests. Gorum decreed that only the worthiest warrior would be fit to claim *Ovinrbaane* as their own, and all others would be slain and added to the guardians protecting the tomb.
> The Tiger Lords are led by the supposedly reborn Armag, known as the [[Armag the Twice-Born]], and either seeks or already wields *Ovinrbaane*.
