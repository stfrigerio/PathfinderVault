> The ***Elder Sign*** is a stone tablet with a bas-relief in the shape of a twig with five branches. It is a potent magical sigil capable of reliably keeping creatures and [[Magic|magic]] of the [[Elder Mythos]] at bay, or banishing such creatures to the place on the [[Material Plane]] where they originated. However, there are only a limited number of *Elder Signs* in existence, and each one destroyed permanently lessens the universe's defenses against the horrors beyond.



## Powers

> An *Elder Sign* has three powers, each of which requires the recitation of a different occult mantra to activate:

> - **Banishment:** The *Elder Sign* can banish a creature back to its home [[Plane|plane]]. It can also target creatures native to the same plane where the *Elder Sign* is activated, in which case it sends the creature to its point of origin. If the target is a [[Great Old One]], the banishment always succeeds.
> - **Magic Disruption:** The *Elder Sign* can undo the magic of others, ending the effects of [[Spell|spells]] and suppressing the power of [[Magic item|magic items]].
> - **Sealing:** The *Elder Sign* seals an area against [[Teleportation|teleportation]] and [[Planar travel|planar travel]], both in and out.

## Targets

> Only eldritch creatures can be affected by an *Elder Sign*, which is to say those connected to cosmic horror or the Elder Mythos. Some creatures are innately connected to these forces, the best known of which being the Great Old Ones, but any creature or being can become associated through worship, such as is the case with the [[Old Cults]], [[Night Heralds]], and [[Dominion of the Black]], and as a result become valid targets for the *Elder Sign's* power.


### Cthulhu

> An *Elder Sign* keeps the [[Great Old One]] [[Cthulhu]] trapped in stasis in the sunken city of [[R'lyeh|Rlyeh]].


## Destruction Conditions

> An *Elder Sign* can only be destroyed if used to banish a Great Old One.
