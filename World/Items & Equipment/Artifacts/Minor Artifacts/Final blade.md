> The ***final blades*** are the guillotines of [[Galt]], and are potent symbols of the [[Red Revolution|revolution]]. Each one appears to be different.



## Use

> The *final blades* trap their victims' [[Soul|souls]] to ensure no resurrection is possible. Only Galt's executioners, the [[Gray Gardeners]], know the [[Ritual|ritual]] to release the soul.


## History

> First commissioned by the original [[Revolutionary Council]] (founded by the [[Philosopher|philosophers]] [[Hosetter]] and [[Darl Jubannich]]), these instruments of death were designed by [[Margaery San Trayne|Citizen Margaery San Trayne]]. By her demands, a tool would be used to bring: "a swift and humane end, offering no escape through the [[Magic|magics]] of resurrectionâ€”and furthermore, keeping even the vilest Galtan soul from falling into the clutches of a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] [[Devil|devil]]." This would also, it was thought, prevent [[Hell]] gaining more [[Evil|evil]] souls.
