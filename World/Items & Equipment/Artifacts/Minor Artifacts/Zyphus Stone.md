> The ***Zyphus Stone*** is a [[Necromancy|necromantic]] [[Artifact|artifact]] dedicated to [[Zyphus]], the [[Deity|deity]] of accidental death. Its main power is the creation of [[Zyphus zombie|Zyphus zombies]], [[Undead|undead]] creatures capable of spawning [[Zombie|zombies]] by killing and consuming them. Its seeming intent is to allow followers of Zyphus to continue honoring their [[Deity|god]] after death. The *Zyphus Stone* is currently in the possession of the [[Pathfinder Society]] in [[Absalom]].



## History

> Legend has that the *Zyphus Stone* was buried by [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] [[Human|humans]] beneath what was then the village of [[Oppara]] in [[Taldor]] over 6,000 years ago. They hid it away for further study, intrigued by its power, yet fearing its ability to create a plague of zombies, but eventually abandoned it.
> A [[Cleric|cleric]] of Zyphus named [[Fel Bustrani]] recently learned of the existence of the *Zyphus Stone*, and determined that it was buried in a chamber below the [[House of the Immortal Son]], a former temple of [[Aroden]] that had become Oppara's most famous [[Opera|opera house]]. He tricked the [[Pathfinder]] [[Bodriggan Wuthers]] to help him access the building and begin excavations beneath it. The two eventually accessed the [[Chamber of the Stone]] where the artifact was located in [[4708 AR]], whereupon Bustrani activated it and killed Wuthers, turning him into a Zyphus zombie.


## Powers

> Other than the creation of Zyphus zombies, the *Zyphus Stone* also has the ability to lock the doors of the building in which it is located and creating a dimensional anchor-type effect that bars extradimensional movement in and out of (but not within) the structure.


## Destruction

> Unlike most other [[Minor artifact|minor artifacts]], the *Zyphus stone* can be destroyed by conventional means, although its power gives it incredible hardness against all but [[Magic|magical]] attacks.
