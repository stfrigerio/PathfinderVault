> ***Serithtial*** is [[Minor artifact|minor artifact]]-level, intelligent, [[Mechanics/Spells/Spells/Level 1/Magic Weapon|magical]] [[Bastard sword|bastard sword]] crafted, it is said, by the [[God|goddess]] [[Iomedae]] herself as a weapon against [[Zon-Kuthon]].



## History

> The blade was first used by the great-grandfather of [[Mandraivus]], a hero of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] who led several [[Cheliax|Chelaxian]] crusades against [[Nidal]]. The sword became a hereditary heirloom of his family, passed down through generations, until it was given to Mandraivus. Knowing its power, he used it in his assault on [[Scarwall|Castle Scarwall]], the seat of power of the evil warlord [[Kazavon]]. When Kazavon was revealed to be a great wyrm [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]], sent by the god Zon-Kuthon himself, Mandraivus and his companions slew him, as only Serithtial has the power to end his control over others. Its potency was once again demonstrated when it was used by adventurers to sunder the control the [[Crown of Fangs]] held over the possessed [[Ileosa Arabasti|Queen Ileosa]] of [[Korvosa]] in [[4708 AR]].


## Description

> Worshipers of Zon-Kuthon fear the blade, as it is especially lethal against the followers of the [[Midnight Lord]], and the intelligent weapon uses all her powers to aid her wielder in destroying them. Serithtial was forged a bastard sword, but possesses the ability to sense what type of blade her wielder is most proficient in and take on that form. As long as her user is dedicated to the destruction of Kazavon and those under his influence, Serithtial acts willingly, and does not attempt to exert control over him or her. Once this dedication wanes, however, the sword attempts to will her wielder to find her a more suitable carrier.
