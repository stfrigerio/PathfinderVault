> A ***crown of the simurgh*** is created by a [[Simurgh|simurgh]] to protect a specific person. They can only craft one every five centuries. It grants the wearer the ability to mentally contact the simurgh and summon the creature to their side. This artifact is destroyed if ever brought to the [[Shadow Plane]].
