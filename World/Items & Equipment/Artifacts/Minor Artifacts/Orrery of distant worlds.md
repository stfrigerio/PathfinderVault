*See also: [[Orrery]]*
> The ***orrery of distant worlds*** is a [[Magic|magic]] [[Artifact|artifact]] designed to facilitate communication with otherworldly intelligences.


## Construction

> The *orrery* is a portable model of [[Golarion]]'s [[Solar system|solar system]], featuring removable spheres representing its [[Sun|sun]] and 10 [[Planet|planets]]. The *orrery* only functions when all 11 spheres are mounted. Each sphere can hold a number of [[Spell|spell]] charges similar to a [[Staff|staff]] and can be recharged by [[Arcane|arcane]] [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]].


## Use

> When expanded on a surface, the *orrery* fixes itself in place. Its detail makes it a useful reference for questions about the solar system.
> Once per month, the *orrery* can serve as a communication device to contact alien life. This connection is powerful enough to result in mind-affecting visions. However, if the *orrery* is destroyed while such a connection exists, it can cause painful feedback.
