# Ancestral Embrace

**Item 26**

> This brightly colored *+4 [[Major Resilient]] [[Leather Armor]]* is inscribed with a spiral that has no end or beginning. Though it is a symbol of the ancient religion of Holy Xatramba, it also serves as a [[Religious Symbol]] of [[Pharasma]]. When you invest the armor, you gain negative resistance 25 and can draw on the power of your ancestors. You gain an ancestry feat from your ancestry; the feat can be any level, but you must meet any other prerequisites of the feat. You lose the feat when the investment ends, and you can select a different feat each time you invest the armor again.
