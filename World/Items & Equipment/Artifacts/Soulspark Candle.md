# Soulspark Candle

**Item 20**

> This thick, white pillar candle has flecks of ash and bone mixed amid the wax. When lit, the candle sheds [[Bright Light]] for 20 feet and [[Dim Light]] for a further 20 feet. The candle can't be snuffed by weather, water, or accident but can be purposefully snuffed through ritual prayer. The candle doesn't release heat and can't be used to start a fire. The candle is never exhausted, regardless of how long it burns.The area within the candle's light is a consecrated space. Worshippers of [[Pharasma]] within this area gain a +3 status bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and Perception checks. [[Undead]] creatures and worshippers of [[Urgathoa]] within this area take a –3 status penalty to those checks.When an undead creature or a [[Haunt]] comes within the light of a *soulspark candle* , the candle's flame turns from red to black, makes a loud crackling sound, and releases a flash of bright sparks. The candle continues to burn black and crackle for as long as a haunt or undead remains in the area.

title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* command ([[Evocation]] [[Light]]) 
**Requirements**: The candle is lit, and an undead is within the light's area;
**Effect**: You command the candle to illuminate the dead. All undead creatures in the area are limned in blue, heatless fire for as long as they remain in the area, plus 1 minute after they leave the area or the light goes out. Visible undead can't be [[Concealed]] while limned in these flames. [[Invisible]] undead are concealed while limned in these flames, rather than being [[Undetected]]. Haunts are unaffected by this light.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬽{.Pathfinder }* command ([[Divine]] [[Evocation]] [[Fire]]) 
**Requirements**: The candle is lit, and an undead or haunt is within the light's area;
**Effect**: You command the candle to destroy the undead. The candle's flame erupts into a mass of fire that burns away undead and haunts. Any undead within the candle's light takes 20d8 fire damage (DC 45 [[Basic]] Fortitude save). Pharasma empowers these flames, allowing them to ignore fire resistance or immunity. Any haunts in the area are instead subject to Pharasma's banishing light. The candle attempts a check to disable each haunt with a +35 modifier. This check applies to any skills applicable to disable the haunt and always has legendary proficiency. Once the candle is Activated in this way, its light immediately goes out, and the candle can't be relit for 1 hour.
