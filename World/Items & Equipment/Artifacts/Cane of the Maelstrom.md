# Cane of the Maelstrom

**Item 22**

> A large crystal of [[Warpglass]] floats above the head of this silvery purple *+3 [[Anarchic]] [[Greater Striking]] [[Club]]*. If you successfully Strike a creature, the cane also affects the target with a [[Warpwave]]. While you carry the cane, you hear a constant, distracting chorus of laughing, incoherent [[Protean]] whispers and sing-song voices in your mind. Blatant acts of self-indulgence or narcissism quell these whispers, from a few minutes up to a full day depending on the scope of the act, but they immediately return when you use the artifact's powers. The gradually rising chorus eventually drives away rational thought and renders the cane's owner insane, even if staved off from time to time with self-centered acts. As the artifact's abilities pull material from the [[Maelstrom]], it doesn't function in areas where planar connections are severed.
