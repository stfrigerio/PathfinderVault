# Phoenix Fighting Fan

**Item 20**

> This elegant *+3 [[Greater Striking]] [[Flaming]] [[Silver]] [[Fighting Fan]]* features sharp silver feathers instead of traditional paper leaves in its design.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬½{.Pathfinder }* command, envision, Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You call upon the fan's extradimensional powers to trap a creature in Hao Jin's repository, a small demiplane that holds the countless relics Hao Jin collected over her lifetime (though a trapped creature cannot interact with any of these relics). The fighting fan casts *[[Maze]]* on a creature within 30 feet. The fan automatically Sustains the Spell as long as you Strike a creature with it each round. The [[Survival]] or Perception DC to escape the demiplane is 34. The spell ends once the creature escapes, you fail to Strike a creature with the fan during a round, or after 1 minute, whichever comes first.
