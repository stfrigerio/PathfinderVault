# Whisperer of Souls

**Item 28**

> This *+4 [[Major Striking]] [[Greater Brilliant]] [[Keen]] [[Glaive]]* binds the souls of powerful creatures it slays. The soul can't be returned to life by any means while imprisoned within the glaive and can be freed only by a deed of great benevolence or selflessness. While using the glaive as a weapon, whenever you reduce a sapient creature of 18th level or higher to 0 Hit Points or roll a critical success with a Strike against such a target, the creature must attempt a DC 50 Fortitude save.
**Critical Success**: No additional effect.
**Success**: The glaive siphons the creature's essence, rendering it [[Drained 1]]. If the creature dies from the Strike or while drained in this way, the creature's soul is bound in the glaive.
**Failure**: As success, but the creature is drained 2.
**Critical Failure**: As success, but the creature is drained 4.The glaive also has the following activations.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⭓{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Trigger**: You Strike with the *Whisperer of Souls*;
**Effect**: You choose whether the Strike deals lethal or [[Nonlethal]] damage. If the glaive has a reason for doing so, such as slaying a creature whose soul the glaive can absorb, it can defy your choice if you fail a DC 50 Will save.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⭓{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Trigger**: You attempt an [[Occultism]] check to [[Decipher Writing]], [[Identify Magic]], [[Learn A Spell]], or [[Recall Knowledge]] ;
**Effect**: You listen to eldritch secrets the weapon whispers, gaining a +4 item bonus to the triggering check.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬽{.Pathfinder }* command, envision, Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per week;
**Effect**: Attempt an Occultism check as if you cast the [[Legend Lore]] ritual about a subject. If you roll a success or critical success, you can repeat what the *Whisperer of Souls* relates to you about the subject. On a critical failure, you and the glaive are drawn into a murmuring void of cold, where your mind is assaulted by strange visions for an entire week. At the end of this time, you reappear and must attempt a DC 50 Will save.
