# Lesser Cube of Nex

**Item 20**

> A *Lesser Cube of Nex* acts as a *[[World/Items & Equipment/Wondrous Items/Cube of force]]* , but the effect lasts until you press the sixth face to Dismiss it, and the activation can be used once per hour. You must first Dismiss any previous activation before you use it again. Additionally, each *Lesser Cube of Nex* is attuned to a single school of magic. Within 5 feet of the *Lesser Cube* , all magic from that school is suppressed or impossible to cast, with the effects of a 10th-level *[[Antimagic Field]]* spell. While there are eight *Lesser Cubes of Nex* , each of the artifacts is unique, as there's only one *Lesser Cube of Nex* for each school of magic.
