# Perfected Robes

**Item 22**

> These unadorned white robes, fastened with simple brass pins in the shape of a human hand, can't be soiled or blemished. While wearing *perfected robes* , you don't need to eat, sleep, or drink, but you can if you choose to. The robes bless you with constant *[[True Seeing]]* (+32 counteract bonus). A creature who dons these robes without earning them is [[Clumsy 3]], [[Enfeebled 3]], and [[Stupefied 3]] while wearing them, gaining the *true seeing* but otherwise unable to use the robes' magic.
