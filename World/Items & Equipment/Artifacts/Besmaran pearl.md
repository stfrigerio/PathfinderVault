> ***Besmaran pearls*** are granted to [[Besmara|Besmaran]] worshipers who conclude their [[Voyage Besmara|Voyage]] and succeed to their Holy Labors determined by the [[Laharra Seaspray|high priest]] of [[Besmara's Temple|Besmaras Temple]]. These inscribed [[Magic item|magical]] pinkish pearls are attuned only to the proud pilgrims to whom they were gifted. They reflect the supplicants' own natures as well as the unpredictable will of the Pirate Queen herself, so their effects vary. Veterans of the Voyage recognize each other by these pearls.
