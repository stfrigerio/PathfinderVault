# Cube of Nex

**Item 25**

> The *Cube of Nex* acts as a *[[Lesser Cube of Nex]]* except it suppresses all magic within 5 feet of it with the effects of a 10th-level *[[Antimagic Field]]* spell, instead of just one school. However, spells you cast and magic items you wield ignore the antimagic field from the *Cube of Nex*.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per minute;
**Effect**: A *cube of force* or *Lesser Cube of Nex* within 60 feet of you becomes inert. It can't be Activated, any current activation ends, and any constant abilities it has cease to function.

```
