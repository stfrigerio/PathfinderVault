# Oculus of Abaddon

**Item 15**

> An *oculus of Abaddon* is a potent artifact rumored to have been created by one of the [[Four Horsemen Of The Apocalypse]] as a way to reward those who work as their agents on the [[Material Plane]]. More likely, these items were crafted by a powerful pre-Earthfall death cult that has long since moved on, leaving behind these dangerous artifacts to tempt mortals into serving the needs of the Horsemen.An *oculus of Abaddon* appears as a sphere of clear crystal that contains a pinpoint of flickering red light at its center. When held, the oculus feels warm to the touch and fills you with a sudden desire to pluck out an eye and place the oculus within the socket—this causes 4d6 [[Persistent Bleed Damage]]. Once placed in an eye socket, the oculus can be removed only by ripping it free (causing the same amount of persistent bleed damage as the initial plucking). When you place the oculus in your empty eye socket, you immediately heal all damage caused by plucking the previous eye out. Once placed, an oculus grants you constant [[Darkvision]]. It can also be activated to perform a number of other magical effects, as detailed below, but if you aren't evil, each time you activate an *oculus of Abaddon* , you must succeed at a DC 36 Will save or become affected by a *[[Subconscious Suggestion]]* (heightened to 8th level) to perform an evil act the next time an opportunity to do so arises, as determined by the GM.
