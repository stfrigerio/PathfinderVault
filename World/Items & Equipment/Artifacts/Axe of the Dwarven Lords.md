# Axe of the Dwarven Lords

**Item 26**

> The blade of this *+4 major striking [[Keen]] [[Returning]] [[Speed]] [[Dwarven Waraxe]]* is carved with an intricate design depicting countless generations of great dwarven warriors and leaders. The axe has the [[Thrown 30 Feet]] weapon trait, in addition to the normal weapon traits for a dwarven waraxe. Strikes with the axe deal an additional 1d6 damage to orcs. While the axe is in your possession, you gain a +4 item bonus when [[Crafting]] armor, jewelry, metalworking, stonemasonry, snares, traps, and weapons. If you are a [[Dwarf]], you gain [[Greater Darkvision]] while holding the axe. If you are not a dwarf, you are [[Stupefied 4]] while holding the axe, and if you are an orc, you are also [[Drained 4]] and [[Enfeebled 4]] while holding it.
