# Final Blade

**Item 20**

> A Large or smaller restrained or willing creature can be executed by a *final blade*.
**Activate**: 1 minute (Interact);
**Effect**: You execute a creature restrained beneath the blade. The creature you execute takes 11d10 slashing damage and must succeed at a DC 45 Fortitude save or be decapitated as though it suffered a critical hit with a natural 20 from a *+3 major striking [[Vorpal]]* scythe. The soul of a creature executed with a *final blade* is trapped, and the creature can't be returned to life, not even by *[[Miracle]]* or similar magic. A *final blade* can hold any number of souls in this way, and a sufficient number of captured souls forms a monster called a [[Gray Death]].
**Destruction**: A final blade can be destroyed via the rare ritual, [[Blunt The Final Blade]].
