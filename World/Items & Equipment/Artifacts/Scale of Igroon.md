# Scale of Igroon

**Item 21**

> Carved from a scale of the [[Kaiju]] Igroon, this jagged shield refracts light around it in a shimmering haze. A *scale of Igroon* (Hardness 20, HP 160, BT 80) recovers 4 Hit Points at the start of its wielder's turn. When you [[Raise A Shield]], you can use the [[Shield Block]] reaction with the scale of Igroon to block an attack or effect that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, or sonic damage as well as physical damage.

*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Requirements**: You're in an area of [[Bright]] or [[Dim Light]] ;
**Effect**: You angle the shield to refract light. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +4 item bonus to [[Stealth]] checks to [[Hide]] and [[Sneak]] and can do so while [[Observed]]. This bonus ends if you Activate another ability or use the Shield Block reaction.
