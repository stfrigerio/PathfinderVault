# Coldstar Pistols

**Item 23**

> One [[Dueling Pistol]] in this paired set is etched with flames along its barrel, while the other is etched with icicles. In these separate forms, one gun comprising the *Coldstar Pistols* functions as a *+3 [[Greater Striking]] [[Greater Flaming]] dueling pistol* and the other as a *+3 greater striking [[Greater Frost]] dueling pistol*. When joined, the guns form a double-barreled weapon that functions as a *+4 major striking greater flaming greater frost dueling pistol*. The combined form has a [[Range Increment]] of 120 feet. In either form, the Coldstar Pistols have the [[Agile]], [[Concealable]], [[Concussive]], and [[Fatal D10 Traits]]. As star guns, the *Coldstar Pistols* run on magic and don't use ammunition or black powder.
