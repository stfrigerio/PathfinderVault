> ***Visineir*** is [[Mephistopheles]] quill pen, created for him by [[Dahak]] from an [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]] mountain in [[Nessus]] in exchange for the [[Adamantine Morass]], a region of [[Caina]] ceded by Mephistopheles to Dahak to be his divine realm. Although Mephistopheles prefers to wield his [[Trident|trident]] in combat, *Visineir* can also be used as a [[Weapon|weapon]] capable of storing blood samples of creatures struck by it, granting Mephistopheles various special powers over those victims. If *Visineir* is used to pen a contract that forces [[Asmodeus]] to void the creation of Mephistopheles, both he and it crumble to ashes.
