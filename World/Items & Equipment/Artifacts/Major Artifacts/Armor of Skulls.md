> The ***Armor of Skulls*** is a suit of [[Frost giant|frost giant-sized]] [[Magic Armor|magical]] [[Nethys/Equipment/Armors/Breastplate|breastplate]] [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] constructed using the skull of the dread [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] [[Kazavon]], one of the [[Seven Relics of Kazavon]]. It was crafted in the mid-47th century AR by the frost giant Jarl [[Yensiir Rimeblood]], who is still its owner. An [[Artifact|artifact]] of great power, it is infused with the soul of the dead dragon and is intelligent.


## History

> The skull of Kazavon was brought to the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] by the [[Kellid human ethnicity|Kellid]] prince Kuiragh, one of the companions of [[Mandraivus]], who together defeated the blue dragon at [[Scarwall]]. Each of them took one of Kazavon's skeletal remains back to his or her homeland, so that the great servant of [[Zon-Kuthon]] might never reform.
> Kuiragh brought the skull to the [[Mountain of Frozen Echoes]] in the [[Tusk Mountains]], a place sacred to his people, and secretly buried it in a shrine. He trusted in his own silence and the spirits of his ancestors to keep anyone from discovering the terrible artifact.
> The skull lay there for nearly 600 years, until the Jhodagarn [[Frost giant|frost giant]] clan invaded and took control of the sacred mountain. The skull buried in the shrine called to the giants, commanding them to send their bravest warrior to it. Jarl Rimeblood headed the call and freed the skull from its icy grave, believing the spirit trapped within to be that of an ancient god of battle. He then went on to incorporate the skull into a mighty suit of armor, hoping to use its power to take control of all of the Tusk Mountains.
