> The ***Axe of the Dwarvish Lords*** is a powerful [[Major artifact|major artifact]] of the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] created by [[Taargick]] at the Conclave of the Final Deep.


## Description

> The sturdy haft of the [[Dwarven waraxe|dwarven waraxe]] called the *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords* shines with veins of [[Silver|silver]] and its two blades depict images of ancient dwarven glories.


## History

> When the dwarves completed the generations-old [[Quest for Sky]] under the lead of their great king Taargick, the success was not without implications. Many dwarves feared the all-revealing light, the exposure to the weather, the open sky and the countless weird creatures of the alien surface. For thousands of dwarves, reaching the surface only convinced them that they should have stayed in the deep earth. Taargick sensed the fear growing and he gathered the leaders of his people in a hidden cavern, remembered as the Conclave of the Final Deep and together they constructed a simple forge. With ore they brought from the depths of their ancient homeland and strange new metals discovered on the surface they crafted a symbol of their people and poured into it their strength, resolve, legends, memories and the blessing of [[Torag]]. When it was done, King Taargick addressed his people, raising the *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords*. He convinced them that the traditions of the old nations might forge wonders from the riches of the new world and emboldened them to face the challenges of the surface.
> The *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords* passed through the hands of many kings but was stolen by unknown thieves during the chaos of the [[Five Kings Wars]]. It was found in the hands of [[Eurad Dberryl|General Eurad Dberryl]] but was claimed by [[Ordrik Talhrik|Theocrat Ordriks]] followers during the [[Forge War]]. Knowing the threat to his rising regime that the axe represented, Theocrat Ordrik hid it away deep beneath [[Droskar's Crag|Droskars Crag]].
> The *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords* ended up in the hoard of the ancient [[Magma dragon|magma dragon]] [[Moschabbatt]]. The [[Dragon|dragon]] killed the secret team Theocrat Ordrik sent to [[Jernashall|Jernashalls]] ruins. Now the dragon is the keeper of dwarves' most precious artifact and the key to a lost golden age of dwarven culture.
