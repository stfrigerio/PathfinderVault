> ***Saint Cuthbert's Mace*** is a legendary artifact associated with [[Cuthbert|Saint Cuthbert]] who lived on a world different and far from [[Golarion]]. *Saint Cuthbert's Mace* is [[Teleport|teleported]] every year on 20th day of [[Pharast]] to somewhere in the [[Great Beyond]] where it may be found in time by a hero to aid in smiting a major evil. While the mace is teleported without its current wielder, it does not abandon its wielder in a time of great need, even if it must delay its departure by a few days.
