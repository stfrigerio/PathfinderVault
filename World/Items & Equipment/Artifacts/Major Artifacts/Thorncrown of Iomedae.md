> The ***Thorncrown of Iomedae***—or, as it is known to the faithful of [[Iomedae]], the ***Truecrown of Iomedae***—is a [[Major artifact|major artifact]] made from the blasted remnants of Iomedae's helmet left after she succeeded in the [[Test of the Starstone]].



## Description

> The *Thorncrown* appears to be a wooden circlet impaled with jagged spikes of [[Metal|metal]], the remains of Iomedae's helmet. When worn by a [[Paladin|paladin]], it transforms into its true form: a brilliant halo of [[Divine|divine]] power.


## Function

> For any wearer, the *Thorncrown of Iomedae* functions similarly to a *crown of blasting*. However, the *Thorncrown's* true powers are unlocked only when worn by a pious paladin: it enhances their healing and merciful touch as well as their ability to smite [[Evil|evil]]. If a paladin is slain while wearing it, the *Thorncrown of Iomedae* can even briefly resurrect the paladin to continue their sworn duties before passing on.
> The *Thorncrown* harms any evil creature who wears it, and any paladin who breaks their code while wearing the artifact is instantly disintegrated.


## History


### Creation

> As Iomedae stepped forth from the [[Starstone Cathedral]], her [[Armour|armour]] melted from her new divine form. She soon departed to serve her [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]], and her new followers gathered the molten remains of her armour to be forged into holy relics of her new religion. Her helmet survived more intact than the rest of her armour and has become known amongst her followers of the *Truecrown of Iomedae*. The *Truecrown* was returned from [[Absalom]] to distant [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] by the [[Knightly order|knightly order]] Iomedae had once led, the [[Knights of Ozem]]. Upon reaching Lastwall's capital of [[Vigil]], her dedicated knights began work on Iomedae's first cathedral, the [[Cathedral of Sancta Iomedaea|Sancta Iomedaea]], to house the *Thorncrown*.


### Theft and resurfacing

> However, on the eve of the cathedral's consecration, the *Thorncrown's* guardians were found slain and the artifact was gone. No one knows who stole the *Thorncrown of Iomedae* or where it went, but 15 years later it emerged in the possession of the [[Pathfinder Society]]. The burgeoning Church of Iomedae petitioned the Pathfinder Society to return the sacred artifact, but were ultimately ignored. The *Thorncrown* then moved between various [[Pathfinder lodge|Pathfinder lodges]] for 800 years as various experts tried to unlock its mysteries, including any kind of insight into the Test of the *Starstone*.


### Disappearance from Galt

> The *Thorncrown* was located in the [[Woodsedge Lodge|Pathfinder lodge]] in [[Woodsedge]] when the [[Red Revolution]] swept [[Galt]], and it was lost to looters. Since then, reports of the *Thorncrown* have surfaced in places as distant as [[Qadira]] and [[Varisia]], where both the Pathfinder Society and Church of Iomedae still hunt for the missing relic.
> One purported spotting of the *Thorncrown* occurred in the [[Fangwood]] within [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], by the Iomedaean paladin Benner Lightbourne during his infiltration of a criminal band of [[Nirmathi]] smugglers. He learned of a magical crown resembling the *Thorncrown* being stolen from an agent of the [[Aspis Consortium]] and fenced to an unknown woman en route to [[Tamran]]. However, he was unable to retain aid from the Knights of Ozem on rumor alone, and was captured by the [[Apostate devil|apostate devil]] Vipostix while attempting to locate it on his own.
