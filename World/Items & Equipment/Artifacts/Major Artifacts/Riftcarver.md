> ***Riftcarver*** is the scythe of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Deskari]], which he carved from the exoskeleton of his mother as one of his first acts. It was the primary tool he used to dig his [[Abyssal realm]], the [[Rasping Rifts]]. Deskari's followers have also built smaller versions of *Riftcarver*, called *rotcarvers*, designed to be used by [[Human|human]]-sized cultists. *Riftcarver* can only be destroyed if it is used to kill the resurrected mother of Deskari.
