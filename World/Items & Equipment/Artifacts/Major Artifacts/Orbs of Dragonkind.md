> The ***Orbs of Dragonkind*** are [[Major artifact|major artifacts]] granting power over [[Dragon|dragons]] of a particular type. *Orbs* are known to exist for each type of [[Chromatic dragon|chromatic dragon]] and [[Metallic dragon|metallic dragon]], and varieties for each type of [[Imperial dragon|imperial dragon]] and [[Primal dragon|primal dragon]] are also rumored to exist.



## History

![[Apsu_image_1.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Apsu battles Dahak.
> Although the full history of the *Orbs of Dragonkind* has largely been lost, incomplete lore places their origin during the original conflict between the draconic [[God|gods]] [[Apsu]] and [[Dahak]] and their followers. The dragons' slaughter of one another during their conflict led the draconic mother [[Goddess|goddess]] [[Tiamat]] to shed ten tears, which landed on the slain bodies of heroes of each of the dragon species. The [[Soul|souls]] of these dragons entered the crystallized tears, transforming them into powerful [[Artifact|artifacts]] that granted immense power and authority over others of their kind.
> The *Orbs* remained major figures in draconic history following the flight of Apsu and his followers through the [[Material Plane]], becoming part of draconic hoards to be hidden away or used as tools to [[Slavery|enslave]] other dragons. The *Orbs* have persisted into the modern day as both coveted and feared items among dragonkind, which dragons have killed one another to possess but allied to keep out of the possession of other races.


## Properties

> The most significant property of the *Orbs of Dragonkind* is that they allow their wielders to [[Magic|magically]] control dragons. The wielder of an *Orb* can use it to exert powerful mental control over any dragon whose species matches that which the *Orb* is attuned to, effectively enslaving them to their will. Ownership of an *Orb* also grants immunity to the breath weapon of that dragon species, in addition to the ability of the wielder to use such a breath weapon three times per day. Further, someone using an *Orb* can detect the presence of any dragon within ten miles of their location, and of their *Orb'*s particular variety within 100 miles.
> An *Orb of Dragonkind* also allows its wielder to communicate with any other person currently wielding an *Orb* of their own. As most such figures are dragons themselves, this exposes wielders to the risk of discovery and retribution by dragons enraged at the thought of a non-dragon enslaving their kin.
> The souls used to create each *Orb* remain within the artifacts. Although they are dormant most of the time, they can occasionally be awakened by exceptional individuals. However, the spirits within the *Orbs* are capable of enslaving those who would wield them to their own ancient wills.


## Known *Orbs of Dragonkind*

> The following are some of the known or suspected *Orbs of Dragonkind*, or parts of them:

> - The [[Gold dragon|gold dragon]] [[Mengkare]], ruler of the isolated island of [[Hermea]], has presented each visiting ambassador from [[Andoran]], [[Druma]], and [[Taldor]] with a sliver of [[Gold|golden]] crystal. There are reports of other visitors being gifted with similar items. The dragon claims these are shards of an *Orb of Dragonkind* (especially the gold one). If so, the dragon presumably still holds the rest of the pieces.
> - The journals of [[Pathfinder]] [[Ivdra Zarroka]] describe "a storm of fury and ice locked within an orb" as part of a massive [[Mammoth|mammoth]]-shaped [[Zoic fetish|zoic fetish]] among the [[Ice Chasm Following]] of the [[Tusk Mountains]]. This totem was formed from the mammoth mount of Loakzeem, Jaikzam, who fell in battle against the [[White dragon|white dragon]] [[Zeidz]].
> - An *Orb of Red Dragonkind* formed from the soul of the ancient [[Red dragon|red dragon]] Baelgoroth is known to be in the possession of the [[Storm giant|storm giant]] warlord [[Volstus]], who has been using it dominate red dragons to bolster his armies.
> - The *Song of the Dawning Star* was owned by Sheiheth Rafzammi of [[Thuvia]] until her death in [[4707 AR]]. She bequeathed it to her nephew Raffiet, who attempted to deliver it to the [[Copper dragon|copper dragon]] [[Mierusildas]] near [[Glasswall Isle]] via caravan from [[Pashow]]; however, the caravan and *Orb* were lost to a sandstorm.
> - The massive *Stormsheart*, more than 250 feet in diameter, is locked within the vaults of [[Erebus]] and emits the deafening screams of more than 1,000 [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] [[Soul|souls]] sacrificed within. Unlike other *Orbs*, *Stormsheart* allows those who can avoid being driven to [[Madness|madness]] by the tormented souls of the dragons within it to detect and control any blue dragon alive.

## Lesser *Orbs of Dragonkind*

> There are other, less powerful, *Orbs of Dragonkind* in existence and legend, for instance:

> - An *[[Orb of Dragonkin]]* grants its wielder power over other members of the dragon family besides [[True dragon|true dragons]], such as [[Drake|drakes]], [[Wyvern|wyverns]], [[Dragon turtle|dragon turtles]], [[Kongamato|kongamatos]], [[Faerie dragon|faerie dragons]], [[Pseudodragon|pseudodragons]], [[Gorynych|gorynyches]], [[Jabberwock|jabberwocks]], [[Linnorm|linnorms]], [[Spine dragon|spine dragons]], and [[Tatzlwyrm|tatzlwyrms]].
> - An *[[Orb of Dragon Mastery]]* allows its wielder to control dragons like a true *Orb of Dragonkind*, but possesses less power and half the range of the more powerful artifact. Its power can be increased by steeping it in the blood of a recently killed dragon.
> - An *[[Orb of Dragonshape]]* allows its wielder to temporarily take the shape of a specific type of true dragon.
