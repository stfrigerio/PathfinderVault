> The ***Bloodstones of Arazni*** are a group of four canopic jars holding the internal organs of [[Arazni]], the former herald of [[Aroden]], now known as the Harlot Queen. They were created by [[Geb (person)|Geb]], the ruler of the eponymous nation, in the process of reanimating Arazni's corpse as a [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|lich]]. Each of the jars holds a small sliver of not only her former divine power, but also that of her former master, Aroden. The jars were stolen from [[Geb's Rest]] by the [[Knights of Ozem]] toward the end of the 39th century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]], and their current location is unknown. Arazni believes that the owner of the *Bloodstones* gains power over her, and has therefore been searching for them continuously for the past 800 years.
