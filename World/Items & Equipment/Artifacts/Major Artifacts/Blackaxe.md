> This [[Greataxe|greataxe]] is made from obsidian, but is as strong as [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]]. Dripping acid constantly, being hit by this weapon also causes acid burn damage. Striking a living tree heals the wielder while killing the tree.
> Treerazer loans the weapon to his minions on occasion. However, he can use the wielder's senses, know where the wielder is at all times, use his spell-like abilities through Blackaxe, and recall Blackaxe regardless of distance.
