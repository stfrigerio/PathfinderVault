> ***Alaznist's Hateful Ranseur***, originally named ***Evoker's Ranseur***, is an *Alara'quin* created by [[Xin]] as the symbol of office for [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Alderpash]]. This intelligent [[Weapon|weapon]] constantly screeches about destruction and vengeance on any wielder other than the runelord of wrath. It usually lands critical strikes, and leaves bleeding wounds and wretched scars on the rare foes that manage to survive a battle against it. When [[Alaznist]], the final runelord of wrath and the person who wielded the *Hateful Ranseur* for the longest time, used it to impale the skull of Alderpash (who only 'survived' this attack due to his status as a [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|lich]]), it is said to have gained the ability to wound the mind as well.
