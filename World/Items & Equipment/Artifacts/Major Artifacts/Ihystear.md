> The ***Ihystear*** is a foot-long glowing shard said to be the final piece of the [[Spear|spear]] used by [[Asmodeus]] to kill his brother [[Ihys]]. It still holds the final scream of Ihys; snapping the *Ihystear* in half will release a terrible echo of this piercing scream, audible from miles away, which can kill victims instantly and deafen or [[Insanity|madden]] survivors, before the *Ihystear* heals itself, and possibly randomly shifts to another [[Plane|plane]]. The *Ihystear* has been held in Asmodeus' Catafalque in [[Nessus]] for aeons, but has been reportedly seen on [[Golarion]] recently.
