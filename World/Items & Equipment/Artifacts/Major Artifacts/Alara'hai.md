> The ***Alara'hai***, or ***Seven Swords of Sin***, or ***Seven Blades of Conviction***, are seven legendary [[Sword|swords]] wielded by the champions of each of the [[Runelords|runelords]] of ancient [[Thassilon]]. Forged by the respective runelord, each of these blades embodied the power of the runelord and were used by each champion in combat against another. When the ancient runelords went into hiding the once tremendous power of these weapons also diminished until their power was comparatively mundane. 
> Still, they have circulated among weapon collectors and relic dealers as historic curios, for while their power diminished, their legend has not. At the height of their power, these swords were incredible weapons; *[[Chellan]]*, for example, was known to turn those it struck into crystal statues sometimes with only a single blow.


## Swords

> The seven swords of the *Alara'hai* are:
> - *[[Asheia|Asheia Sword of Lust]]*
> - *[[Baraket|Baraket Sword of Pride]]*
> - *[[Chellan|Chellan Sword of Greed]]*
> - *[[Garvok|Garvok Sword of Wrath]]*
> - *[[Shin-Tari|Shin-Tari Sword of Sloth]]*
> - *[[Tannaris|Tannaris Sword of Envy]]*
> - *[[Ungarato|Ungarato Sword of Gluttony]]*

## History

> During the destruction of [[Thassilon]], during [[Earthfall]], the *Alara'hai* went into a dormant state, much like the runelords who forged them. While they retained certain [[Magic|magical]] properties during their dormancy, their powers were greatly reduced. When [[Karzoug]], Runelord of Greed, was awakened from his slumber in [[4702 AR]], his sword *Chellan* sprang back to life as well, revealing itself to be an intelligent, domineering [[Artifact|artifact]] of considerable might.
