> The ***Leng Device*** is a [[Major artifact|major artifact]] built by [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Karzoug]] and his almost-human [[Denizen of Leng|denizens of Leng]] allies from the [[Plane|plane]] of [[Leng]]. The final project undertaken by Karzoug before he entered the Eye of Avarice to hide from [[Earthfall]], the *Leng Device* was built by Karzoug to create a [[Time|temporal]] [[Portal|portal]] that would allow travel from any point in the future to a specific day in the height of [[Shalast]]: Karzoug knew that he would need an army to conquer the [[Golarion|world]] when he awoke from his slumber. When Earthfall hit, the *Leng Device* was nowhere near completion and had to be sealed away.
> In truth, unknown to Karzoug, the original purpose of the *Leng Device*, and the reason why the almost-humans worked with him at the first place, was to awaken the [[Great Old One]] [[Mhar]], slumbering beneath [[Mhar Massif]] where Karzoug's capital, [[Xin-Shalast]], was located. In [[4707 AR]], when Karzoug was about to return to the [[Material Plane]] from the Eye of Avarice, under orders from an unknown patron from [[Kadath]], several denizens of Leng sojourned to Xin-Shalast and secretly re-purposed the temporal portal to a time long before [[Thassilon]]; when Karzoug's *[[Runewell|runewell]]* triggers, its power will be siphoned into the *Leng Device*, awakening Mhar. Their plans were thwarted by the same group of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] that killed Karzoug.
