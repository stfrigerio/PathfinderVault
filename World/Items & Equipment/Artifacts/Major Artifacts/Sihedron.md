*For another meaning of "Sihedron", please see [[Sihedron rune]].*
> The ***Sihedron***, or ***Shattered Star*** is a magical [[Artifact|artifact]] of incredible power created by the archmage [[Xin]], the founder of ancient [[Thassilon]], himself. It is sundered into seven shards, each made of a different [[Skymetal|skymetal]]. If these shards are rebuilt, its full abilities may be discovered. Each shard, however, carries a [[Curse|curse]] related to its associated sin. The curse may be suppressed by placing a specific type of *[[Ioun stone|ioun stone]]* in the appropriate spot of the shard. Additionally, the [[Magic|magic]] effects of each shard are so strong that carrying more than two causes problems such as becoming nauseated.



## Shards

> The seven shards of the *Sihedron* are:

> - *[[Shard of Envy]]*
> - *[[Shard of Gluttony]]*
> - *[[Shard of Greed]]*
> - *[[Shard of Lust]]*
> - *[[Shard of Pride]]*
> - *[[Shard of Sloth]]*
> - *[[Shard of Wrath]]*

## History

> The *Sihedron* was created during the [[Age of Legend]] by Xin, a powerful [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] [[Wizard|wizard]] who had been exiled from his homeland to the northwestern coast of [[Avistan]]. His power was eventually usurped by the seven [[Runelords|runelords]] and, during this rebellion, the *Sihedron* was broken into seven pieces. Xin had arranged for his magical resurrection should the *Sihedron* ever be put back together, but the runelords suspected his plot and split up Xin's mysterious artifact so that he could not rise upon its reconstruction. Each of them took the shard that corresponded to his or her own specialty.


### Recent History

> After the shards of the *Sihedron* were found and brought together by a group of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] in [[4712 AR]], [[Pathfinder Society]] [[Venture-Captain]] [[Sheila Heidmarch]] of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]] called together the [[Sihedron Council]] to decide on what to do with the reassembled artifact.
