> The ***Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga*** is a [[Major artifact|major artifact]] belonging to the mythic witch [[Baba Yaga]], granting her immense ability to travel within the [[Material Plane]] and into the [[Great Beyond]].



## Description

> The *Dancing Hut* appears as a rustic hut on two huge, fifteen-foot-tall chicken legs. Despite its comical appearance, its outer shell is a powerful [[Construct|construct]] capable of rapid movement and vicious attacks. On the inside, the hut is much larger than it looks from the outside, with an interior layout that changes depending on the outer shell's location in the multiverse.
> The hut's movement can be controlled by manipulating a small brown egg in a dish on a table in the central room, while its ability to [[Teleport|teleport]] throughout the multiverse is activated by tossing two "keys" into a bubbling cauldron. Each location to which the hut can travel is linked to two specific keys. For example, to teleport to [[Irrisen]], one must toss some bone meal and a snowflake into the cauldron. Keys that have been used, stolen, or destroyed reappear in the hut one hour later.


## Inhabitants

> Besides Baba Yaga herself, numerous beings have taken up part-time or full-time residence within the hut's ever-shifting halls.

> - **The Coffin Man:** A [[Thanadaemon|thanadaemon]] from [[Abaddon]] who claims to be Baba Yaga's cousin.
> - **[[Crone queen|The Crone Queens]]:** Twelve of Baba Yaga's daughters and former queens of [[Irrisen]], drained of life and cursed with [[Undeath|undeath]].
> - **Gaj:** An unusually polite—yet still evil—[[Jotund troll|jotund troll]].
> - **Louhi:** A beautiful female [[Human|human]] [[Wizard|wizard]] who claims to be the hut's true inheritor and scorns Baba Yaga's power.
> - **[[Zorka]]**: A [[Fey|fey]] creature who serves as Baba Yaga's housekeeper.
> - **[[Amitrie Leth]]**: An [[Aranea|aranea]] scholar researching the true history of the [[Multiverse|multiverse]].
