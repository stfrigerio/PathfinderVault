> ***Vesper's Rapier*** is a beautifully crafted [[Sword|sword]] that changes its form to become the sword of preference of its wielder, so it actually need not be a [[Rapier|rapier]] for many of its wielders. It is a [[Major artifact|major artifact]]. The sword originated from [[Shyka|Shyka the Many]]: one of the [[Eldest]] who granted it to Vesper, the [[Bard's End|bard]], for whom it took on the form of a rapier. The [[Artifact|artifact]] can be destroyed if it is taken into a [[Demiplane|demiplane]] where [[Time|time]] does not pass.
> *Vesper's Rapier* is known to occasionally disappear and reappear at random locations in the world, a power thought to be tied to Shyka's connection to time. The blade is currently due to reappear in the vicinity of [[Lake Silverstep]] in the [[Stolen Lands]], and two contingents of [[Fey|fey]]—a [[Fey creature|fey]] [[Silver dragon|silver dragon]] agent of Shyka known as [[Eranex]] sent to retrieve the [[Weapon|weapon]]; and an [[Ankou|ankou]] worshipper of [[Count Ranalc]] and his allies, seeking to use the weapon to bring back the vanished Eldest—have come to await its arrival. The two parties are now in an uneasy truce, which will only last until *Vesper's Rapier* finally reappears.
