> The ***Primogen Crown*** is one the two most well-known symbols of power for the [[Grand Prince]] of [[Taldor]] (the other being the [[Lion Throne]]). It is at once both the actual crown worn by the emperor of Taldor, as well as a metaphor for the office, the ruler, and the authority he wields. Taldan myths claim that it was forged by [[Taldaris|First Emperor Taldaris]] and includes the mane of the [[Grogrisant|grogrisant]]. It is currently held by [[Stavian III|Grand Prince Stavian III]].
