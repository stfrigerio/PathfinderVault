*For another meaning of "Shredskin", please see shredskin (creature).*
> The **Shredskin** is an [[Artifact|artifact]]-level magical mantle made from the flayed ribs of the [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] [[Kazavon]], a servant of [[Zon-Kuthon]]. It is now kept by the god himself in his vaults in [[Xovaikain]] on the [[Plane of Shadow]].


## History

> Kazavon was defeated at [[Scarwall]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]] in [[4063 AR]] by the hero [[Mandraivus]] and his cohorts. Even after the dragon was dead and dismembered, they noticed that the pieces tried to move towards each other and bind themselves back together. Not wishing for Kazavon to be reformed, each of the companions took a part of his body and dispersed them throughout [[Golarion]].
