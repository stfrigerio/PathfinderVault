## History

> The *Shattered Shield of Arnisant* is all that remains of the artifact known as the ***Shield of Aroden***. The *Shield of Aroden* was first forged in the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] nation of [[Xopatl]], using materials [[Aroden]] learnt in Arcadia during his time wandering [[Golarion]]; this history is largely unknown to scholars, who only believe that Aroden carried it when he was a mortal, or that it was fashioned by Aroden after his apotheosis and gifted to his first priest. What is known for certain, is that it was carried by the [[Taldor|Taldan]] [[Arnisant|General Arnisant]] in the final battle with the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] during the [[Shining Crusade]]. The general used the power of the *Shield* to great effect during the war, rallying or rescuing his troops, and keeping defeats from becoming slaughters. In the climactic battle of that decades-long war, the Whispering Tyrant attempted to transport Arnisant's still-beating heart into his hands by means of a *wish* spell. The *Shield* blocked the spell, but was shattered into twelve pieces by the power of the [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|lichs]] magic. One of the splinters of the *Shield* buried itself in the Whispering Tyrant's hand, consuming him in holy fire and destroying his mortal form. His [[Soul|spirit]] then fled to its [[Phylactery|phylactery]] deep in the dungeons below [[Gallowspire]].
> After the end of the war and the establishment of the nation of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], the remaining shards of the *Shield* were moved to Vigil, where they became a ceremonial object used by the [[Watcher-Lord]] during the swearing of great oaths.


## Description

> The artifact is displayed in Castle Overwatch and appears to be an ancient, yet simple black wooden [[Shield|shield]] broken into 12 pieces, with the center piece missing. If the pieces are assembled, it becomes clear that the front of the *Shield* carries Aroden's holy symbol: a winged eye in a circle. The *Shield of Aroden* was designed to absorb harmful [[Magic|magic]] targeted at the wielder into itself, often cracking in the process. Aroden was always able to reassemble it, but no one else could; after its destruction at the end of the Shining Crusade, the *Shield* has remained shattered and powerless, but is of great historical importance to the people of Lastwall. However, it survived an attempt to destroy it in [[3971 AR]], and cannot be destroyed by anything less than a [[Chaotic neutral|chaotic neutral]] [[Demigod|demigod]] or [[Deity|deity]].


## Recent events

> In [[4717 AR]], all but one of the shards of the *Shattered Shield of Arnisant* were stolen from Vigil by the Six Wise Crows, a band of thieves working for Tar-Baphon via his seneschal [[Jomah Gildais]], who replaced them with fakes and handed them to the [[Whispering Way]]. However, before that, one of the thieves, Jasaxi, had taken one of the shards for himself, after having coerced the smith responsible for crafting the fakes to create an extra one. As the extra fake was handed to the Whispering Way, the real shard it replaced ended up in a black market in [[Azir]], capital city of [[Rahadoum]], in [[4719 AR]].
> Using the magic-absorbing property of the *Shattered Shield*, the Whispering Tyrant fashioned his new superweapon, the *Radiant Fire*, which uses the shards of the *Shield* as ammunition.
