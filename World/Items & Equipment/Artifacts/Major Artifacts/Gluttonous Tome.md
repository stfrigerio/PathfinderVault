> [[Zutha|Runelord Zutha]] [[Magic/Divination|divined]] [[Thassilon|Thassilons]] impending fall and made contingencies to survive. He bound his essence into an eldritch [[Book|book]], the ***Gluttonous Tome***, as a [[Phylactery|phylactery]] and then split it into three volumesâ€”the *Kardosian Codex*, the *[[Bone Grimoire]]*, and the *Black Book*.


## Histories and reunifications

> Zutha entrusted the three volumes to his three greatest servants. Thassilon's destruction was more complete than Zutha anticipated, however, and the three books were scattered to the farthest corners of [[Avistan]]. If the three books are ever brought together, whoever possesses the reconstituted *Gluttonous Tome* will be possessed by the spirit of the [[Undead|undead]] [[Runelord|runelord]] and Zutha will be free to plague the world once more. Each book also includes a [[Golem manual|golem manual]] as an appendix.
> The [[Pathfinder]] [[Bhoston Jola Rould]] sought the *Gluttonous Tome*. Benigo Ygresta and [[Varian Jeggare]] each have possessed the *Kardosian Codex*, and former Pathfinder [[Eando Kline]] had once possessed the *Bone Grimoire*. The *Black Book* once lay in a treasure hoard within the [[Mindspin Mountains]] peak known as the [[Sleeper]].
> In [[4715 AR]], Varian rebuilt the *Gluttonous Tome* under Zutha's influence, but Jeggare's companions Eando and [[Radovan Virholt]] freed him from Zutha, and together they defeated the risen runelord before he could properly reconstruct his body. They later scattered the *Gluttonous Tome* once again. However, this brief return was enough for Zutha to re-establish a foothold in the world and for his influence to fester within all fragments.


> *[[Lord of Runes]]* tells the story of Varian Jeggare's reunification of the *Gluttonous Tome's* volumes.
