> ***Krune's dragon-tooth spear*** is one of the *Alara'quin*, an intelligent [[Weapon|weapon]] originally crafted by [[Xin]] for the [[Runelords|runelords]] as their symbols of office. As an embodiment of the virtues of rest, Xin granted it with insightful patience and the purpose of defending [[Lissala|Lissalas]] faithful. It sees writing as the ideal form of communication; loyally communicates with its rightful owner, [[Krune]]; and is concerned with providing comforts for him, while any other person who tries to wield it will have to hear the [[Spear|spears]] irritating criticisms of being carelessly spontaneous.
