> ***Xanderghul's Flawless Hammer*** is an *Alara'quin* created by [[Xin]] as the symbol of office for [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Xanderghul]]. This lucerne hammer was made from an unknown type of [[Skymetal|skymetal]] that outwardly resembles nothing more than normal [[Iron|iron]], but its blows always struck true, at its peak potential. Unlike the other *Alara'quin*, the *Flawless Hammer'*s intellect is not of its own, but a mere replication of Xanderghul's arrogant mind.
