> The ***Bone Grimoire*** is one of the three volumes that make up the *[[Gluttonous Tome]]*, the [[Phylactery|phylactery]] of [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Zutha]].


## Contents

> The *Bone Grimoire* is a hundred-page tome of [[Necromancy|necromancy]] written in blood, and can also be used once a year as a [[Golem manual|manual]] for a [[Flesh golem|flesh golem]]. A reader of the *Bone Grimoire* becomes [[Undead|undead]]-like as their [[Soul|soul]] becomes saturated with Zutha's influence.
> The *Bone Grimoire* can only be destroyed with the runewaking [[Ritual magic|ritual]], which was designed by [[Sorshen]] near the end of Thassilon but never used before [[Earthfall]]. Doing so forces Zutha to manifest at a third of his power, and if this manifestation is destroyed before a minute passes, the entire *Gluttonous Tome* will be destroyed along with Zutha.


## History

> In preparation for Earthfall, Zutha divided the *Gluttonous Tome* into three volumes and entrusted them to his three greatest servants, instructing them to bring the pieces back once the dangers of Earthfall had passed. [[Thassilon]]'s destruction was more complete than Zutha anticipated, however, and the three books were scattered to the farthest corners of [[Avistan]].
> In [[4715 AR]], [[Eando Kline]]—who possessed the *Grimoire* at the time—unwittingly helped [[Varian Jeggare]] rebuild the *Gluttonous Tome* while Jeggare was under Zutha's influence from the *Kardosian Codex*. Kline, along with Jeggare's companion [[Radovan Virholt]], later freed Jeggare from Zutha, and together they defeated the risen runelord before he could properly reconstruct his body. They later scattered the *Gluttonous Tome* again, but this brief return was enough for Zutha to re-establish a foothold in the world and for his influence to fester within all of its fragments.
> While the other two pieces remained hidden, the *Bone Grimoire* fell into the hands of Leptonia, a [[Half-drow|half-drow]] [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Yamasoth]], who used it as payment for the service of the [[Dhampir|dhampir]] necromancer [[Erigantus]] in crafting the polymorph plague. Erigantus took the *Bone Grimoire* to [[Kaer Maga]] and studied it, eventually finding a way to destroy the seal in the Shrine of the Seal. Armed with this knowledge, Erigantus assaulted the Shrine of the Seal and slaughtered its guard, removing one of the two seals that was keeping [[Tar-Baphon]] imprisoned.


> The *Bone Grimoire* and its reunification with the other *Gluttonous Tome* volumes are central to the plot of *[[Lord of Runes]]*.
