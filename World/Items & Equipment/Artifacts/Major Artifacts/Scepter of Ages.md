> The ***Scepter of Ages*** is a [[Major artifact|major artifact]] granting power to travel through [[Time|time]].


## Appearance

> The *Scepter of Ages* resembles an oversized key, with strange [[Metal|metal]] prongs and rune-marked teeth on one end, and [[Gem|gem]]-studded hoops and discs on the other.


## History

> In [[Azlant|Azlants]] heyday, the Sculptor of the Seafoam Dome predicted the rise of a new [[Thassilon|empire of wizardry]] in the [[Avistan|east]] and depicted each sculpture with the symbol of a key.
> When [[Earthfall]] was approaching, [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Xanderghul]] planned to use the *Scepter of Ages* to travel forward in time and avoid the cataclysm, but he ran out of time before he could locate the *Scepter of Ages*.
> In -4003 AR, the mad prophets Casmos and Cielas, bearing what appeared to be the *Scepter of Ages*, were arrested and lived out the rest of their lives in prison, making uncanny predictions.
> In -2256 AR, the [[Shory Empire|Shory]] [[Aeromancer|aeromancer]] Viddon of Jidran killed his own son after his future daughter warned him that the boy would destroy a [[Sky city|sky city]], then went on to make giant leaps in [[Aeromancy|aeromancy]].
> In [[-919 AR]], the *Scepter of Ages* was offered to the ruler of [[Ninshabur]], who hid it in the vaults of [[Tabsagal]] where it stayed until [[Pathfinder]] [[Durvin Gest]] stole it in [[4328 AR]].
> The *Scepter of Ages* eventually fell into the hands of Runelord [[Alaznist]], who has recently woken and had previously studied Xanderghul's research. She used it to unlock the refuge where Xanderghul slumbered, hidden from Earthfall, and killed him. With the *Scepter of Ages*, Alaznist travelled back in time to Thassilon seven times to absorb mythic power and arrange for the arrival of the [[Oliphaunt of Jandelay]] in the future to threaten [[Varisia]]. She was eventually confronted by a group of heroes armed with the *[[Sihedron]]*, who disrupted her manipulation of temporal power by using time-locked energy harvested from [[Crystilan]]. Alaznist used the *Scepter of Ages* to trap them within Crystilan, but had to release the artifact into an unknown time and place in order to avoid being trapped herself.
