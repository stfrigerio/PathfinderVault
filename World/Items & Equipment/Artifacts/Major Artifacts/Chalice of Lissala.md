> The ***Chalice of Lissala*** is a large [[Gold|golden]] chalice gifted by [[Lissala]] to her followers in the empire of [[Thassilon]]. Its bowl resembles seven overlapping feathered wings inlaid with spiky [[Gems|gems]], its stand is [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake]]-shaped, and it enhances its wielder's [[Magic/Enchantment|enchantment]] [[Magic|magic]]. During Thassilon's era, the *Chalice of Lissala* was stationed in the [[Great Temple of Lissala]] in western [[Bakrakhan]], which sank under the [[Varisian Gulf]] after [[Earthfall]]; it is now owned by Vanush, a [[Kraken|kraken]] who uses it to lure sailors to their deaths and sacrifice them in the hope of restoring Lissala's cult. When no worshipper of Lissala remains, the *Chalice of Lissala* will crumble into worthless black [[Metal|metal]].
