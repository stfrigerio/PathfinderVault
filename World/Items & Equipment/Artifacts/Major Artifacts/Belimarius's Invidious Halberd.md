> ***Belimarius's Invidious Halberd*** is one of the *Alara'quin*, an intelligent [[Weapon|weapon]] originally crafted by [[Xin]] for [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Naaft]] as her symbol of office. Xin granted this weapon the ability to [[PathfinderWiki/Magic/Abjuration|nullify]] [[Magic|magic]] and saw Naaft as a regulator of power, but his hopes died as she fell to sin. The *Invidious Halberd* hated both itself and [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]], accepting the runelords of envy as its owners but never appreciating them; it is only happy when cutting down arcane spellcasters, especially [[Wizard|wizards]]. Due to its ability to negate magic, the [[Halberd|halberd]] earned both scorn and jealousy from its owners.
