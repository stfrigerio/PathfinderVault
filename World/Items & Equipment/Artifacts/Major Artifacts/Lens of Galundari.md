> The ***Lens of Galundari*** is a mysterious ancient [[Artifact|artifact]] which the [[Pathfinder]] [[Durvin Gest]] retrieved from [[Tabsagal]] in [[Ninshabur]] on the continent of [[Casmaron]]. Found in the "Chamber of Heaven" within the temple, the *Lens* was apparently different in nature than other [[Artifact|artifacts]] found nearby, such as the *[[Scepter of Ages]]* and the *[[Apollyon Ring]]*. The purpose and power of the *Lens* are lost on much of the modern world, but it was presumably so dangerous that Gest traveled to [[Osibu]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] to destroy it by throwing it into the [[Nemesis Well]] in [[4332 AR]].
> The true nature of the *Lens* is that is was created by the [[Wizard|wizard]]-king [[Nex (person)|Nex]] as a more potent version of the lenses that powered his demon ships. In the process of creating the *Lens*, Nex used guile and false promises—and, according to some scholars, aid from [[Heaven]]—to imprison [[Galundari]], a [[Balor lord|balor lord]] of immense power, within the artifact. While many believe Galundari to have been lost alongside the *Lens* that bears his name, some of his servants still work to discover where the Nemesis Well leads and retrieve the *Lens* in order to free their lord.
