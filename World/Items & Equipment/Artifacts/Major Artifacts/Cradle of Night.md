## Appearance

> A *Cradle of Night* resembles a fist-sized, shadow-cloaked black orb.


## History

> *Cradles of Night* were used by the Forsaken to mould the humans of Calignos into the various [[Dark folk|dark folk]] subraces, and are also capable of imparting shadowbound corruptions on living creatures, who do not age and gain [[Healing|healing]], strength, and health as long as they are not in bright light. They become bound to the Forsaken in exchange, and when they die their body vanishes in a flash of light while their [[Soul|soul]] is sent to the [[Shadow Plane]] to infuse the Forsaken's power.
> When the Forsaken disappeared, most *Cradles of Night* shattered. The few that survived lost the ability to transform [[Humanoid|humanoids]] into dark folk. One such *Cradle of Night* was discovered by the [[Kellid]] warlord Haramil, and was buried with him after he died.
