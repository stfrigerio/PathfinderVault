*This article covers the tome on [[Golarion]] and the [[Demiplane|demiplane]] it contains. For the real-world series of books, see [[Princes of Darkness Book of the Damned Volume 1|Princes of Darkness]], [[Lords of Chaos Book of the Damned Volume 2|Lords of Chaos]], [[Horsemen of the Apocalypse Book of the Damned Volume 3|Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], and [[Book of the Damned sourcebook]].*
> The ***Book of the Damned*** is one of three legendary [[List of written works|books]] compiled by the [[Angel|angel]] [[Tabris]], along with the *[[Chronicle of the Righteous]]* and *[[Concordance of Rivals]]*, that purportedly contain all knowledge in existence. The *Book* describes the [[Abyss]], [[Hell]], and [[Abaddon]], and includes details of their rulers and inhabitants and how the world of [[Golarion]] has connections to these lower [[Plane|planes]]. Dire warnings concerning the reader's soul are often appended to these pages.



## History

![[Tabris.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Tabris hard at work on the *Book of the Damned*.
> The *Book* is a mysterious and legendary tome, pages of which are said to still exist in certain libraries, including the Apocrypha [[Forae Logos]] in [[Absalom]] where it is termed the 'Black Book'. It was compiled by Tabris, an angel who collected lore of the [[Great Beyond]] but whose endeavours with the *Book* led to his trial and exile from [[Heaven]].
> The rulers of Heaven ordered the *Book of the Damned* to be erased from existence in a vault-kiln of the [[Great Library]], but the book disappeared and was not seen again until fragments were discovered ages later across the [[Material Plane]]. The book has since been largely reconstructed on Golarion.


### Copies

> Several mortal attempts to copy parts of the *Book* resulted in mundane, error-filled manuscripts that nonetheless contain considerable knowledge of [[Evil|evil]]. These include:

> - The Ghatigahni Folio, a [[Vudrani language|Vudrani]] version, contains graphic illustrations and details about the [[Cagashags]] [[Hellmouth|hellmouth]] and Reiisiier's true name. It resides in the collection of Captain Elliot Braker of [[Anthusis|Eleder]].
> - *Plaques of the Black Sun*, an [[Osiriani]] copy stored under [[Sarenite]] guard in the [[Temple of the Redeeming Sun]], covers [[Belial]] and bears the sigil of [[Ardad Lili]].
> - The Versex Text, a [[Varisian language|Varisian]] translation in the Sincomakti Lyceum, is sourced to the [[Whispering Tyrant|Whispering Tyrants]] rule, covers the [[Imp|imp]] Vagagat and [[Levaloch|levaloch]] Jhapvhag, and bears the sigil of Romeiga.

## Contents

> The *Book of the Damned* is contained in three sections, which may be found separately from the rest of the book. Known sections include:

> - The Daemonic Section
> - The Demonic Section
> - The Diabolic Section
> The *Book* is constantly updated with new knowledge of evil deeds and actors, [[Spell|spells]], conspiracies, creatures and mysteries that span [[Planet|planets]], locations of [[Portal|portals]] to [[Alignment|evil-aligned]] planes and sites of evil deeds, instructions on how to destroy [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|good-aligned]] artifacts and find evil-aligned artifacts, true names of [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]], profane [[Ritual|rituals]], detailed information about evil [[Demigod|demigods]] and [[Great Old One|Great Old Ones]], and accounts of divine failures (such as the rebellion in Heaven, wars against [[Titan|Titans]], and fates of dead gods).


### Demiplane

> The book itself can also be inverted into a [[Portal|portal]] to an expansive [[Demiplane|demiplane]] that contains the evidence and research used to compile its record of evil deeds, and at its center a path to the [[Unspeakable Word]]. The information is cataloged by the [[Voice of the Damned]], a bound entity who also defends the Unspeakable Word.


## Daemonic Section

> This section concerns Abaddon and its native [[Daemon|daemons]]; it also acts as a vast [[Spellbook|spellbook]] containing every evil spell and some others. It is written in a confusing mix of both [[Abyssal Language]] and [[Infernal]], requiring deep skills in both to understand the text, though the book can also communicate its contents [[Telepathy|telepathically]]. The frozen bindings of the book seem to be made of ash and draw in any local light. The pages inside are clearly palimpsest, with the redacted sections obscuring earlier history of Abaddon; this is likely the power of the [[Four Horsemen|Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] who are known to wipe away history when it is unpalatable to them. Ownership and study of the book can yield great power but only for thoroughly evil students.
> A selection of the chapters in the Daemonic Section include:

> - On the Nature of Daemons
> - Ride of the Horsemen
> - Paean of the First
> - Creation's Suicidal Urge
> - On Daemons
> - The Church of Nothing
> - The Fallen Masters
> - The Ride of the Four
> - Horrors of the Four

## Demonic Section

> This section concerns the Abyss, its rulers and its inhabitants, constantly updating itself as the chaos of the Abyss continuously transforms the Plane. It is written in [[Abyssal Language]] and is bound with sharp cold iron covers likely to wound any reader; readers of any alignment bar [[Chaotic evil|chaotic evil]] suffer just by touching the book and worse by reading it.
> Some of the chapters in the Demonic Section include:

> - History of the Abyss
> - The Maw Eternal
> - Demonicide
> - Whispers from the Womb
> - The Innumerable Host
> - The Finest Treachery of Hope
> - Before Sin
> - The Death and Birth of the Nightripper
> - Visitations
> - Rituals for demonic transformation
> - Demonic Spells

## Diabolic Section

> This 2,500-page, flesh-bound folio of [[Infernal language|Infernal]] text contains profane images and diagrams and describes rituals, prayers, and practices of Hell. It also contains heretical information about [[Deities|deities]] and evil spells. Greater devils can scry the book without being detected, and the book itself defiles its surroundings, empowers evil spellcasters, and answers questions about Hell, creatures of [[Lawful evil|lawful evil]] [[Alignment|alignment]], or profane subjects.
> Some of the chapters in the Diabolic Section include:

> - Before
> - The Triumph of Hell
> - The Iron Heart of Dis
> - On Dis
> - A Season of Hell
> - Order
> - The Prayer of All Praises
> - The Peerage of Hell
> - Spheres of the Malebranche
> - A Vision of the Pit
> - Exodus
> - The Account of Pious Mor

> [[Paizo]] published a series of books representing three volumes of the *Book of the Damned*: *[[Princes of Darkness Book of the Damned Volume 1|Princes of Darkness]]*, *[[Lords of Chaos Book of the Damned Volume 2|Lords of Chaos]]*, and *[[Horsemen of the Apocalypse Book of the Damned Volume 3|Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]*. The *Book* is also the subject of chapters in *[[Hell Unleashed]]* (pages 16-21) and *[[Artifacts 26 Legends|Artifacts  Legends]]*.
