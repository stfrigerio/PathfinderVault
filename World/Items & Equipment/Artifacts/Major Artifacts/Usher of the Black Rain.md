> ***Usher of the Black Rain*** is the [[Weapon|weapon]] of [[Apollyon]], who can switch it between a scythe and a longbow with unlimited ammunition. It is empowered by the [[Soul|souls]] of a dozen [[Angel|angels]] who were flayed after trying and failing to assassinate Apollyon; each of these souls also empower a lesser copy of *Usher of the Black Rain*, granted to Apollyon's greatest servitors as their symbols of office.
