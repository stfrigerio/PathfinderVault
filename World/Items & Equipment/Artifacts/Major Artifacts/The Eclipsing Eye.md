> ***The Eclipsing Eye*** is the symbol of office of [[Dispater]], granted by [[Asmodeus]] himself to the governor of [[Dis]], the greatest city in [[Hell]]. It is a [[Mace|mace]] made of black [[Metal|metal]], with a [[Sun|sunburst]]-shaped top bearing a glowing [[Ruby|ruby]], from which Asmodeus can see everything Dispater sees. Dispater can call it to his hand from any distance, even across [[Plane|planar]] boundaries.
