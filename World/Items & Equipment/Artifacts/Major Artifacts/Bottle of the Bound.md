> Three command words are required to safely use the *Bottle of the Bound*: the Word of Opening, to unseal the bottle; the Word of Binding, to call forth and command its denizens; and the Word of Banishment, to return the fiends to the bottle. The words themselves have been lost but some [[Osirion|Osirian]] [[Wizard|wizards]] believe that the words are three names, spoken in [[Ancient Osiriani]]: the true name of Zelishkar, the name of the [[Efreeti|efreeti]] who aided in binding him, and the birth name of the [[Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues]].
