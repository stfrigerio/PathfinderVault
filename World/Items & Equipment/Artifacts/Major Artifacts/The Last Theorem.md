> ***The Last Theorem*** is a treatise on the culture, [[Philosophy|philosophy]], and [[Science|science]] of the [[Dominion of the Black]], disguised as one about [[Mathematics|mathematics]]. Translated by [[Ramlock]] from a key text of the Dominion, it is closely associated with the [[Pharaoh of Numbers]], one of the four [[Pharaohs of Ascension]], from the time of the [[Second Age of Osirion]]. Its text may contain the fabled Final Theorem, one of the 11 gifts the [[Pharaoh|pharaohs]] received from their otherworldly patrons.
> Though the book itself is non-[[Magic|magical]], the text contains an inherent and powerful magic. If a reader loses focus on the text, even for a moment, the equations on the book's pages have a tendency to shift slightly, requiring any serious reading to be done in a single, continuous session. Those who are able to apprehend the text sometimes achieve a sort of enlightenment from its mathematical truths, but many succumb to permanent catatonia.
> The [[Great Old One|Great Old Ones]] are referenced numerous times in *The Last Theorem*, and the passages that frame its equations are written with strangely religious overtones. The equations themselves depend on 11 constants, all of which are derived from [[Golarion|Golarions]] relationship to the [[Planet|planet]] [[Aucturn]], and can be used to decipher the dates at which [[Osirion|Osirions]] ancient countdown clocks will stop. The White Axiom, the manifestation of Ramlock's reason and humanity, which he left behind prior to writing *The Last Theorem*, will unlock the true power of the text.
