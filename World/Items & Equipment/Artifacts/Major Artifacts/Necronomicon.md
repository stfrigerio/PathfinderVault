> The ***Necronomicon***, originally named ***Kitab al-Azif*** (*كتاب العزيف*), is a blasphemous text, written by the Mad Poet [[Abdul Alhazred]], containing an account of the [[Outer God|Outer Gods]], [[Great Old One|Great Old Ones]], and their [[Mad|mad]] cultists.



## History

> Around 3525 AR, after spending a decade alone in the [[Empty Quarter]], Abdul Alhazred penned the *Kitab al-Azif*. The book's already-sinister notoriety only grew after its author was devoured on the streets of Damascus in [[3533 AR]] by an invisible monster.
> In [[3745 AR]], the *Kitab al-Azif* was discovered by Byzantine scholar Theodorus Philetas and translated into [[Greek]] under the name *Necronomicon*. Philetas was later forced to burn the translation publicly on the steps of a church, but before that, he had already hidden another copy in the town of Ulthar in the [[Dreamlands]].
> In the ensuing centuries, the *Necronomicon* was translated into numerous other [[Language|languages]]. One such language was [[Darklands languages|Necril]]: the [[Necromancy|necromancer]] [[Geir]], a member of the [[Whispering Way]], found the *Necronomicon* in the Dreamlands, transported it to [[Ghasterhall]] in [[Ustalav]], and began to translate it during his quest to become a [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|lich]] and impress his master [[Tar-Baphon]]. Aware that the Whispering Way forbade passing secrets via anything other than whispers and paranoid that he would be found out, Geir enhanced the translation with powerful [[PathfinderWiki/Magic/Abjuration|abjuration]] [[Magic|magic]] that prevented it from being [[Magic/Divination|divined]] or [[Teleportation|teleported]] and hoped that Tar-Baphon would be impressed enough by the gift of the book to pardon him for this violation. His efforts rewarded him with transformation into a lich in [[3751 AR]].
> In [[3754 AR]], Geir finished the translation and destroyed the stolen Greek version just as the [[Shining Crusade]] began. However, when trying to deliver the *Necronomicon* to Tar-Baphon, he was ambushed and killed by [[Paladin|paladins]], who recognised the *Necronomicon* as a dangerous book, but not its true significance. The *Necronomicon* was sent to [[Zimar]], eventually making its way to the scholar Natharen Olatidar. Natharen began to study the book in search for secrets to help the Shining Crusade and grew paranoid that agents of Tar-Baphon might have infiltrated Zimar to reclaim the book.
> In [[3756 AR]], Natharen contacted [[Nyarlathotep]] to help his research. This act drove him insane: he became convinced that the supposed Whispering Way agents were actually working for something far more sinister, and killed a dozen innocents before the authorities killed him, recognised the dangers of the *Necronomicon*, and put it in a secure vault in Zimar for proper investigation after the end of the Shining Crusade. However, this never happened, as the *Necronomicon* was forgotten in the vault.
> During the [[Kelesh|Keleshite]] invasion of [[Taldor]] in [[4079 AR]], the [[Qadira|Qadiran]] scholar Asea Imbandi personally rescued hundreds of books from Zimar's vaults, including the *Necronomicon*. As soon as she began to study it, she committed suicide from the Zenith of the Dawnflower in [[Katheer]]. Other scholars saw the book's dangers from the notes she left behind, and put it in the Mysterium under heavy wards, where it stayed until it was stolen by [[Haserton Lowls IV]].


## Contents

> The Necril translation of the *Necronomicon* is bound in leather cured from the faces of several people, preserved in their final painful moments. Its 888 pages are written on thin, resilient parchment, greasy and cool to the touch.
> Sections of the *Necronomicon* include:

> - Geir's initial musings
> - Abdul Alhazred's wanderings across [[Earth]]
> - How to contact and interact with Mythos creatures
> - Details of the [[Elder Mythos]] (the largest and most dangerous section to sane minds)
> - Magic of the Elder Mythos
> - Similarities between [[Human|humans]] and [[Deep one|deep ones]]; how to gain or remove a deep one corruption
> - How to transfer minds from one body to another
> - Formulae for contacting the Outer Gods and Great Old Ones
> - Information on the Dreamlands
> - How to manipulate [[Time|time]] and space
> The Necril translation of the *Necronomicon* is particularly hard to destroy compared to other copies (none of which exists on [[Golarion]]). It cannot be located by [[Magic/Divination|divination]], while [[Teleportation|teleportation]] will always leave it behind and risks teleporting the [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]] to a singularly dangerous location full of [[Undead|undead]] or Elder Mythos creatures. It can only be destroyed after both Geir (who has since become a [[Demilich|demilich]]) and the Dreamlands duplicate of Alhazred have been destroyed as well, but the destruction of either will likely attract the attention of Nyarlathotep, who might attempt to rescue the *Necronomicon* and relocate it to another [[Planet|planet]].


> **Original source:** The *Necronomicon* was first mentioned in [[H P Lovecraft]]'s short story "The Hound", written in 1922 and published in 1924. The *Necronomicon's* purported author, the "Mad Arab" Abdul Alhazred, had been quoted a year earlier in Lovecraft's "The Nameless City", written and published in 1921.
