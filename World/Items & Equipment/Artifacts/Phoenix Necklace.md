# Phoenix Necklace

**Item 20**

> This brilliant jewelry is made from fine silver interwoven with a uniquely malleable form of ruby that causes the necklace to glimmer like a flickering fire. Hao Jin created the necklaces to mitigate the potential of death during the Ruby Phoenix Tournament pre-qualifier, and she specially attuned each *phoenix necklace* to the silver feathers she created for the pre-qualifying round. While the silver feathers themselves aren't magical, they are required to activate the necklace's power. Each team starts with 3 feathers hidden in their headquarters; they acquire more through challenges and events. Additionally, the tournament emissary's enforcers have the ability to deliver messages to the necklace's wearer at any time by casting *[[Sending]]*, though the wearer can't respond.

*â¬½{.Pathfinder }* command, envision; 
**Effect**: You select any number of willing creatures you can see within 30 feet, including yourself. The selected creatures can make [[Nonlethal]] attacks without taking a penalty to their attack rolls. This effect remains in place until you remove the necklace or use this activation again.
