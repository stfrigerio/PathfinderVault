# Ridill

**Item 20**

> This 12-foot sword was made by a [[Cyclops]] in the ancient past. It might be the greatest dragon-killing weapon ever made, and [[Fafnheir]] justly fears it, which is why he keeps it hidden in his hoard. Runes of dragon slaying are written down its blade. *Ridill* is a *+3 [[Major Striking]] [[Dragon Bane]] [[Speed]] [[Adamantine]] [[Greatsword]]*. While wielding *Ridill* , you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against *[[Fear]]*. This increases to +4 if the effect is from a [[Dragon]]. If you have an ability that depends on Large weapons (such as [[Barbarian Giant Instinct]] ), it works with *Ridill*. *Ridill* is always considered to have the appropriate material or damage type necessary to deactivate a dragon's [[Regeneration]] or cause the dragon's weakness to apply. For example, *Ridill* is considered to be [[Cold Iron]] when attacking a [[Linnorm]], while it would be treated as having dealt cold damage when attacking a [[Red Dragon]]. If the dragon has more than one weakness, only the highest value applies.
**Destruction**: If you boil *Ridill* in the blood of 10 different types of dragon ( [[Blue Dragon]] dragon, red dragon, etc.) and drop the eye of a cyclops seer into the brew, *Ridill* melts away into nothingness.
