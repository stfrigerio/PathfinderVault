# Serithtial

**Item 23**

> 
**Perception**: +28; normal vision and hearing within 60 feet
**Communication**: empathy (partner only)
**Skills**:  [[Iomedae Lore]] +29, [[Religion]] +26, Zon-Kuthon Lore +29
**Int**: +2,
**Wis**: +1,
**Cha**: +2
**Will**: +30The legendary blade *Serithtial* is said to have been forged by [[Iomedae]], goddess of honor, justice, and valor. She is an intelligent *+4 major striking [[Holy]] [[Bastard Sword]]*. Although the sword is made of steel, Serithtial is also treated as [[Cold Iron]] and [[Silver]], allowing her to deal more damage to certain supernatural creatures. She glows as bright as a torch, but you or *Serithtial* can suppress or resume this glow as a single action, which has the [[Concentrate]] trait. In addition, Strikes with *Serithtial* deal an additional 2d6 damage against creatures that are worshippers of [[Zon-Kuthon]], and while wielding *Serithtial* , you constantly benefit from *[[Death Ward]]* and *[[Freedom Of Movement]]* spells that function only against effects created by followers of Zon-Kuthon.Serithtial was forged as a [[Bastard Sword]], and she reverts to this shape when no one wields her, but she can also detect what sort of blade her current wielder prefers and transform into it (choosing from [[Dagger]], [[Shortsword]], [[Longsword]], [[Scimitar]], [[Falchion]], [[Greatsword]], [[Rapier]], or bastard sword) using an action, which she does when first held. The wielder can empathically tell *Serithtial* to transform at any time by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait, after which *Serithtial* uses an action to transform. *Serithtial* is willing to work with a partner of almost any alignment as long as they are dedicated to defeating the great wyrm Kazavon and the forces of Zon-Kuthon. If you ignore those threats and pursue your own agenda instead, before long *Serithtial* attempts to seize control of your body (DC 45 Will save to resist her control), though she typically remains in control for only long enough to find a more worthy partner. You can attempt a new Will save each day to retake control of your body.
**Activate**: envision;
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**:  *Serithtial* spends the appropriate number of actions and casts a 9th level *[[Heal]]* or *[[Zone Of Truth]]* spell (DC 45 for either of the two spells).
**Destruction**: If Kazavon or a great wyrm shadow dragon who is a worshipper of Zon-Kuthon uses its breath weapon on *Serithtial* while she is unattended, the sword melts into a pool of mundane iron.
