# Kortos Diamond

**Item 22**

> The hilt of this *+3 [[Major Striking]] [[Axiomatic]] [[Spell-Storing]] [[Longsword]]* is simple and elegant. The blade itself is made of throneglass—a clear, jewellike crafting material with a razor-sharp edge, capable of absorbing psychic magic and redirecting it at the wielder's enemies. Whenever the *Kortos Diamond* is in an area of dim or brighter light, it glows faintly, as if reflecting the light of a setting sun.While wielding the Kortos Diamond, you gain a +2 item bonus on saving throws against [[Mental]] effects. You can never harm yourself with the Kortos Diamond, even if [[Confused]].If you ever travel farther than 100 miles from the Isle of Kortos while in possession of the *Kortos Diamond* , the sword becomes impossibly heavy; you are [[Encumbered]] as long as you carry the sword and remain outside of this area. If you relinquish the *Kortos Diamond* while away from Kortos, the sword gradually makes its way back to the isle over the course of a year.

```ad-embed-ability

*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Effect**: You attempt a melee Strike with the *Kortos Diamond* against a creature within reach. On a hit, you deal damage as normal and the target's mind is inflicted with a powerful disruptive energy. When the creature attempts to Cast a Spell, it must attempt a DC 44 Will save; on a failure, the spell fails and both the spell and the actions spent to cast it are lost. This effect lasts for up to 1 minute.
