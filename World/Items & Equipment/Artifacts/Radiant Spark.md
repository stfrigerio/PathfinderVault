# Radiant Spark

**Item 25**

> This shining prism is bound within a golden frame. The bright glow within the artifact is the gleaming essence of [[Celestials]] bound within it in ancient times. Each activation consumes a bit of this celestial energy, projecting the screams of the celestials into your mind. While holding the *Radiant Spark* , you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against [[Divine]] spells and effects and you are aware of its powers. If you are good, while holding the *Radiant Spark* , you are [[Sickened 3]] and can't recover from this condition.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* envision, Interact; 
**Effect**: The *Radiant Spark* casts a 10th-level *[[Dominate]]* spell (DC 49) on a creature that isn't from the [[Material Plane]]. Celestials get an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of their save.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⭓{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Trigger**: You begin casting a *[[Planar Binding]]* ritual;
**Effect**: The *Radiant Spark* reduces the casting time of the ritual to 1 hour, and you don't need secondary casters for this ritual.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬲{.Pathfinder }* envision, Interact; 
**Trigger**: The target critically fails their save against the *Radiant Spark's*  *dominate* spell or you critically succeed at binding the target with the *planar binding* ritual using the artifact;
**Effect**: The target must attempt a DC 49 Will save and is immune to further attempts for 24 hours.

```
