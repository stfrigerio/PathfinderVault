# Void Mirror

**Item 20**

> The *Void Mirror* was created on a distant planet by a now-extinct alien cult to aid in unlocking the secrets of the Dark Tapestry. It appears as a 5-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror of dark glass. As long as it's unmounted in a frame, the *Void Mirror* functions only as a mirror, save that it always reflects the sky as if it were night, regardless of the time of day. When the *Void Mirror* is mounted in a frame, it instead serves as a window into space, displaying a star field in its glass rather than a reflection. This frame can be of any quality, but stouter frames help to prevent the frame's destruction and thus help to keep the *Void Mirror* functional.The view presented by the *Void Mirror* is any view of the night sky possible from its current physical location, regardless of time of day. Observations of the sky in this way add a +3 item bonus to [[Astronomy Lore]] or Perception checks made while using the mirror. The point of view can be shifted through hand gestures, causing the scene within the mirror to reorient in any direction desired.A character who peers into the starscape within the *Void Mirror* must attempt a DC 41 Will save. On a failure, the character feels something looking back at them from the dark places between the stars. On a critical failure, this sensation causes the character to become [[Frightened 1]]. The character is then temporarily immune to this effect for 24 hours.By placing the *Void Mirror* in a specially-constructed frame (such as the one within the Cosmic Crypt in this adventure), it can halt the ongoing transformation of a creature that has performed the apotheosis activation.  Building such a frame is beyond the skill of low-level characters, as it requires an artisan with legendary proficiency in [[Crafting]].The *Void Mirror* can be utilized in other ways, but before a character can activate these effects the occult methods to access these ritual-like effects must be [[Researched]] separately. Since the specific methods for these activations vary slightly from person to person, these methods can't be taught; each person who seeks to activate the *Void Mirror* in one of the following ways must complete their own research to unlock the artifact's secrets. Each requires a separate number of [[Occultism]] checks to Research, as detailed below for each activation.
**Activate**: 1 hour (Intract);
**Research**: Accumulate 12 RP by making DC 20 Occultism (expert) checks when Researching (1 week per attempt);
**Frequency**: once per month;
**Effect**: The first activation ritual is known as “Speak to the Void” and allows the user to contact an intelligence in a distant part of the universe, provided the mirror shows that location (regardless of distance). This alien intelligence infuses the user's mind with answers, allowing the user to [[Recall Knowledge]] using [[Nature]] or [[Occultism]] as if they were legendary proficiency with the skill (including the +8 proficiency bonus). If this check fails, the character takes 10d6 mental damage (100 mental damage on a critical failure) as the imparted knowledge does more harm than good.
