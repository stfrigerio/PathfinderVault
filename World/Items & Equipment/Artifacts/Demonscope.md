> The [[Artifact|artifact]] known as the ***Demonscope*** is the most prized possession of the crusaders of [[Mendev]], as its amazing powers help keep the [[Demon|demons]] of the nearby [[Worldwound]] at bay.


## Origin

> [[Clydwell|Saint Clydwell]] is credited with creating the artifact called the *Demonscope* during the [[Mendevian Crusades]]. He and his band of followers arrived at the town of [[Gravehearst]] in what was then the barbarian [[Kellid]] nation of [[Sarkoris]]. The town and the surrounding region were on the verge of falling to the hordes of demons swarming out of the Worldwound.
> The local [[Shamanism|shamans]] had created a scrying device in the form of an onyx orb with which they hoped to defend their land, but they lacked the ability to awaken its power. Saint Clydwell accepted custody of the artifact, and died in battle with a powerful demon in its defense. His death created a magical effect which temporarily banished the demons from Gravehearst. His three disciples took the artifact to [[Clydwell Keep]], and formed the [[Order of Holy Sentinels]] to protect it.


## Powers

> The *Demonscope* has three main functions:

> - It automatically senses the location of any demons within five miles, regardless of their demonic ability to resist spells.
> - It is used to power the [[Minor artifact|minor artifacts]] known as [[Wardstone|wardstones]].
> - It generates a dimensional lock effect with a 250-mile radius; this does not prevent demons entering the Worldwound from the [[Abyss]], but stops them from [[Magic/Conjuration|teleporting]] into Mendev from the Worldwound.
