# Aroden's Hearthstone

**Item 25**

> This coin-sized gemstone can be used on its own but must be included in the construction of a hearth in order to fully activate its magic.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬽{.Pathfinder }* command, envision; 
**Frequency**: once per month;
**Effect**:  *Aroden's Hearthstone* draws in heat from the world itself, causing the ambient temperature within 100 miles to drop below 0°F. Within 1 mile of the *Hearthstone* , the temperature drops to –200°F, rivaling the frigid cold of outer space and dealing 4d6 cold damage each round to every creature in the area. This effect lasts 1 minute, during which time the nearest moon (probably Golarion's) appears an eerie blue color to any observers within 100 miles of the hearthstone. At the end of 1 minute, the hearthstone emits a blast of concentrated heat that deals 25d6 fire damage to creatures and objects within 150 feet.
