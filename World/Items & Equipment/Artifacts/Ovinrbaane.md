# Ovinrbaane

**Item 20**

> **Perception**: +27; [[Precise]] vision 60 feet, [[Imprecise]] hearing
**Communication**: empathy
**Skills**:  [[Deception]] +28, [[Intimidation]] +32
**Int**: +0,
**Wis**: +3,
**Cha**: +4
**Will**: +33 *Ovinrbaane* (literally translated as “enemy of all enemies”) is instilled with an unquenchable bloodlust, and it chafes any time it is not being used to slay. If its partner goes too long without fighting, the sword misleads its wielder into believing they're the real Armag and that anyone around them who isn't obviously a member of their lineage or following is a mortal enemy. The cursed greatsword also slowly changes the features of the wielder over the course of several days or even weeks to appear as those of the original Armag. If left unchecked, these powers seemingly bring the warlord back to life—it's the wait for this subtle transformation to be complete that's kept the current “Armag” in meditation in the tomb for so long. The long-term effects on a PC as a result of this curse are left to the GM to adjudicate, but at the very least should result in a gradual shift of the PCs' alignment to chaotic neutral. If 24 hours pass without *Ovinrbaane* being used in an encounter of at least moderate difficulty, its partner becomes irritable and short-tempered, and is [[Stupefied 2]] until the end of their first turn in a moderate or more difficult combat.Ovinrbaane is a *+2 [[Striking]] [[Wounding]] [[Greatsword]]*. It can perform all of the following activations, but only does so when its wielder is in combat against a foe the sword deems worthy—that is, any creature of the wielder's level or higher.
