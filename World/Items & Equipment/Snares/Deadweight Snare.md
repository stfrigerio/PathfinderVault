# Deadweight Snare

**Item 2**

> This snare is made of magnetized weights and heavy ropes rigged to a trip wire or pressure plate. When a creature enters the square, the magnets and ropes deploy, weighing down the creature's weapons and limbs. The creature must attempt a DC 18 Reflex save.
**Critical Success**: The creature is unaffected.
**Success**: The creature takes a –1 status penalty to attack rolls for 1 round or until it [[Escapes]] (DC 18).
**Failure**: The creature takes a –2 status penalty to attack rolls for 1 minute or until it Escapes (DC 18).
**Critical Failure**: As failure, but the creature drops any metallic items it's holding.
