# Hail of Arrows Snare

**Item 16**

> When a creature enters the snare’s square, it releases hundreds upon hundreds of carefully prepared arrows, blanketing a 20-foot radius around the snare’s square with massive arrow fire that deals 18d6 piercing damage. Creatures in the area must attempt a DC 37 basic Reflex saving throw.
