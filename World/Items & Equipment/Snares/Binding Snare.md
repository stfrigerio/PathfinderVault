**Critical Success**: The creature is unaffected.
**Success**: The creature takes half damage.
**Failure**: The creature takes full damage and is knocked [[Prone]] and [[Immobilized]] for 1 round ( [[Escape]] DC 28).
**Critical Failure**: The creature takes double damage, is knocked prone, and is [[Restrained]] for 1 round (Escape DC 28).
