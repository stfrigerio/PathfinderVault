# Stunning Snare

**Item 12**

> You rig a snare to disorient a creature with a quick bash, leaving it with little ability to defend itself. The trap deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to the first creature to enter its square; that creature must attempt a DC 31 Reflex save.
**Critical Success**: The creature is unaffected.
**Success**: The creature takes half damage and is flat-footed for 1 round and stunned 1.
**Failure**: The creature takes full damage and is flat-footed for 1 round and stunned 2.
**Critical Failure**: The creature takes double damage and is flat-footed for 1 minute and stunned 4.
