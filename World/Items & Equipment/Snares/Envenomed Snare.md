# Envenomed Snare

**Item 7**

> This snare is coated with [[Giant Wasp Venom]] and tipped with needles, which deliver the venom to the first creature to enter the square. That creature takes 4d6 damage (DC 23 [[Basic]] Reflex) and, on a failure, the creature is exposed to the giant wasp venom.
**Craft Requirements**: Supply 2 doses of giant wasp venom.
