# Dream Pollen Snare

**Item 3**

> This simple trap is made of taut twigs that, when triggered, snap down on a pollen-filled sac of a peculiar flower. When inhaled, the pollen imparts a hazy state of profound agreeability. The first creature that enters the snare's space triggers the snare. The creature that triggered the trap must attempt a DC 18 Will save. [[Undead]] creatures and creatures that don't breathe are immune to dream pollen.
**Critical Success**: The creature is unaffected.
**Success**: The creature is [[Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.
**Failure**: The creature is stupefied 1 for 1 round. For 1 minute, the creature becomes [[Friendly]] to all creatures to which it was [[Indifferent]], or [[Helpful]] to all creatures to which it was friendly. If the creature was [[Unfriendly]] or [[Hostile]] to any creatures, it remains unfriendly or hostile to them. If the creature is an [[Animal]], any creature to which it's friendly or helpful can use [[Diplomacy]] to [[Make An Impression]] on it and to make very simple [[Requests]] of it.
**Critical Failure**: As failure, but the duration of the agreeability is 1 hour instead of 1 minute.
