# Wet Shock Snare

**Item 5**

> A hidden copper plate conceals a bag of electric eels. When a creature steps on the plate, the eels become agitated, and the creature takes 4d8 electricity damage (DC 21 [[Basic]] Reflex save). On a critical failure, the current causes the creature to become [[Stunned 2]]. The eels are unharmed after use, but the mechanism is broken as usual for snares.
