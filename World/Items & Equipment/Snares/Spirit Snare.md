# Spirit Snare

**Item 8**

> This complicated snare is affixed with various crystals and Stasian coils attached to strange electrical relays, working on the same principles as etheric [[Spirit Singers]]. When an [[Incorporeal]] creature enters its square, the device lets loose an ectoplasmic web that lashes around the creature's spectral form. The creature must succeed a DC 26 Reflex saving throw or become [[Immobilized]] for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature becomes immobilized for 1 minute. In either case, the incorporeal creature can attempt to [[Escape]] (DC 26).
