# Flame Drake Snare

**Item 5**

> The snare takes the form of a Tiny, [[Drake]] -like clockwork toy. When a creature enters its square the snare activates, causing the drake to spit a gout of fire in a 15-foot cone in the direction from which the creature entered. For instance, if a creature entered the square coming from the east, the cone would point east, to hit any allies behind the triggering creature. Those within the cone must succeed a DC 19 [[Basic]] Reflex save or take 6d6 fire damage. After spitting its fire, the snare falls apart.
