# Torrent Snare

**Item 3**

> You pile waterlogged plants or access a nearby source of water to rain down on a Medium or smaller creature that enters the snare’s square. When a creature enters the square, the snare’s square and all adjacent squares become slippery difficult terrain, and the triggering creature must attempt a DC 19 Reflex saving throw, with the following effects.
**Success**: The target is unaffected.
**Failure**: The target falls [[Prone]].
**Critical Failure**: The target falls prone and is forced into one of the other squares soaked by the snare.
