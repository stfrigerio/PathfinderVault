# Dust Pods

**Item 1**

> You hide fragile pods of pollen or other clinging powder that get in the eyes of the first creature that enters the snareâ€™s square. The creature must attempt a DC 17 Reflex saving throw. A creature [[Dazzled]] by the pollen can use an Interact action to attempt a DC 5 flat check to remove the condition.
**Critical Success**: The creature is unaffected.
**Success**: The creature is dazzled for 1 round.
**Failure**: The creature is dazzled for 10 minutes.
**Critical Failure**: The creature is [[Blinded]] for 1 round and dazzled for 10 minutes after.
