# Boom Snare

**Item 4**

> By combining a [[Lesser Alchemist'S Fire]], a [[Lesser Thunderstone]], and other catalysts with a pressure sensitive trigger, you create a snare that creates a fiery and thunderous explosion when triggered. The target and all creatures in adjacent squares take 2d6 fire damage and 2d6 sonic damage with a basic DC 19 Reflex save. On a failure, they are deafened for 1d4 rounds and take 1d4 persistent fire damage.
**Craft Requirements**: Supply a [[Lesser Alchemist'S Fire]] and a [[Lesser Thunderstone]].
