# Irritating Thorn Snare

**Item 4**

> You dip thorns, spines, or pine needles in a mild toxin that causes skin irritation and swelling, then lash them together into a ball. When a creature enters the snare's square, the thorny ball is lobbed at that creature, dealing 3d8 piercing damage. The creature must attempt a DC 19 Reflex save.
**Critical Success**: The target is unaffected.
**Success**: The target takes half damage.
**Failure**: The target takes full damage and 1d6 [[Persistent Poison Damage]].
**Critical Failure**: The target takes double damage and 2d6 persistent poison damage.
