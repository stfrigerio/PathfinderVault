# Alarm Snare

**Item 1**

> You create an alarm snare by rigging one or more noisy objects to a trip wire or pressure plate. When you create an alarm snare, you designate a range between 100 to 500 feet at which it can be heard. When a Small or larger creature enters the square, the snare makes a noise loud enough that it can be heard by all creatures in the range you designated.
