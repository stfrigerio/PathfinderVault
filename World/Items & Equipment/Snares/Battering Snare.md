# Battering Snare

**Item 1**

> This snare consists of a flat rock or metal plate held in place with a spring or flexible branch. When triggered, the flat object swings wide and smacks the triggering creature violently. The first creature to enter its square receives 2d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 16 [[Basic]] Reflex save). On a critical failure, the creature is also [[Stunned 1]].
