# Striking Snare

**Item 8**

> You affix a trip line or other trigger to a group of either stones or wooden stakes to strike a creature that enters the snare’s square. The creature must attempt a DC 26 basic Reflex saving throw. If you choose stones, the snare deals 9d8 bludgeoning damage; if you choose spikes, it deals 9d8 piercing damage.
