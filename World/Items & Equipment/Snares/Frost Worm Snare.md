# Frost Worm Snare

**Item 9**

> The snare takes the form of a Tiny [[Frost Worm]] clockwork toy. When a creature enters its square, the snare activates, causing the worm to let loose a 30-foot line of frost in the direction from which the creature entered the square. For instance, if a creature entered the square coming from the south, the worm would shoot the line south, to hit any allies of the triggering creature. Those within the line must succeed a DC 25 [[Basic]] Reflex save or take 10d6 cold damage. After spitting its frost, the snare falls apart.
