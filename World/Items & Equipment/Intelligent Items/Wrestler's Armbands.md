**Will**: +17 *Wrestler's armbands* are a set of *[[Armbands Of Athleticism]]* that have gained their own boisterous sapience. Often, such items aren't created intentionally but rather are the result of a truly charismatic champion whose heart and body are unusually strong wearing the *armbands of athleticism* on many adventures as their most important item. Eventually, the essence of their earnest and adventurous spirit has so thoroughly inundated the item it gains a matching spirit and will of its own. Such armbands view themselves as a tough, but fair, trainer for whomever inherits them next, inspiring you to new heights of athleticism. They also spoil for contests, telepathically calling out competitors on your behalf; typically the armbands won't challenge a foe you're unprepared to face, but particularly eager wrestler's armbands might have an unfortunate habit of overestimating your abilities and pushing you into a conflict that's beyond your proven capacity. These armbands have the following activation.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬²{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per minute;
**Trigger**: You succeed or critically succeed at an [[Athletics]] check;
**Effect**: The armbands taunt a creature you're competing with, boasting of your prowess and attempting an Intimidation check to [[Demoralize]] that creature.
