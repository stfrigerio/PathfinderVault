The cloak became infused with a daredevil spirit and a penchant for high-stakes thievery. If its owner isn't willing to partake in such activities, the cloak tries to convince them to sell or give it to someone who will. A purloining cloak can use tendrils of its cloth to attempt [[Thievery]] checks to [[Palm an Object]] or [[Steal]], proudly offering you its loot later. In addition to those of a *mercurial mantle* , a *purloining cloak* has the following activations.
