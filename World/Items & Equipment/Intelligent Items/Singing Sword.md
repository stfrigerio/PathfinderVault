# Singing Sword

**Item 5**

> **Perception**: +11; precise vision 30 feet, imprecise hearing 30 feet
**Communication**: speech ( [[Common]] and four other common languages)
**Skills**:  [[Performance]] +15
**Int**: +2,
**Wis**: +2,
**Cha**: +4
**Will**: +13 (+17 against attempts to quiet its singing)A *singing sword* is a *+1 striking [[Longsword]]* imbued with the consciousness of a boisterous bard, and therefore constantly sings at all times. A *singing sword* can’t stop singing and in fact communicates in no way other than by singing. A successful [[Diplomacy]] or [[Intimidation]] check against its Will DC can convince it to quiet its singing to a whisper for 10 minutes, or 20 minutes on a critical success, though it quickly grows displeased at anyone who attempts this repeatedly. The *singing sword* can spend its actions to attack on its own, with the effects of a *[[Dancing]]* weapon’s activation, except that its attack modifier is +12. Additionally, it can perform the following activations; each casts a composition spell and follows all the usual rules for [[Compositions]].
