**Int**: +6,
**Wis**: +10,

**Will**: +32An encounter with a [[Toshigami]], the enigmatic [[Kami]] who protect cherry trees, is rare, though often sought after and treasured by those who achieve such an encounter. Only a handful of mortals can truthfully claim to have seen a toshigami, let alone met one, though many popular fireside tales tell of virtuous souls receiving a toshigami's blessing to fight for a worthy cause. Such stories have a basis in fact; every so often, a toshigami gives a worthy mortal a flower from their ward, time-locked in perfect bloom and granted sapience. Such *toshigami blossoms* are more sociable than their creators. Like toshigami, a blossom has a strong curiosity about the mortal world. If you wear a *toshigami blossom* , it can intercede for you, helping you make a good impression.A *toshigami blossom* has the following activations.

*⬻{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per minute;
**Effect**: The blossom sends a flurry of cherry blossoms outward in a 20-foot burst that lasts 1 round. You and your allies can see through these blossoms. To all other creatures, creatures within the cloud of blossoms become [[Concealed]], and creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it. When you or an ally succeeds with a Strike against a creature in the blossoms, the Strike deals an additional 1d6 mental damage and an additional 1d6 negative damage to living creatures, or an additional 1d6 positive damage to [[Undead]].
