# Jax

**Item 8**

> **Perception**: +13; precise vision 30 feet, imprecise hearing 30 feet
**Communication**: empathy
**Skills**:  [[Diplomacy]] +14, [[Survival]] +16
**Int**: +1,
**Wis**: +5,
**Cha**: +3
**Will**: +18Jax was a caravan guard who died defending her charges from a pack of Lamashtan cultists in the Spellscar Desert. Her spirit of fury and hopelessness infused her weapon upon her death, imbuing the firearm with a fragment of her soul and intelligence. The rifle, upon awakening, remembered just enough of Jax's former life to think of her former wielder's name as her own. *Jax* is a *+1 [[Striking]] [[Fearsome]] [[Piercing Wind]]* whose driving purpose is to protect innocent travelers in the Spellscar Desert from raiders, bandits, and cultists. *Jax* allows any creature to wield her, but she doesn't reveal her intelligence or powers until she detects an innocent in danger or if her wielder has proven themselves a worthy champion of justice. If she deems a wielder to be unworthy, *Jax* uses her *[[Dominate]]* ability to control the wielder until she can find a new one.If ever used to attack an innocent traveler, or if, in *Jax's* opinion, the attack could be considered banditry, the weapon automatically misfires. If *Jax* witnesses an innocent harmed or killed, she empathically urges her wielder to avenge the victim. If the wielder doesn't comply, *Jax* attempts to cast *dominate* (below). Even if the *dominate* spell fails, Jax withholds all magical abilities, including the *+1 weapon potency* rune and *striking* rune, until her wielder redeems themself.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**:  *Jax* deems you an unworthy agent of justice. She casts *[[Dominate]]* on you (DC 24). If you're chaotic or a worshipper of [[Lamashtu]], you take a –2 penalty to your Will save, and the result of your save is one degree of success worse than the result you rolled. *Jax* orders you to fight banditry and protect innocent travelers in the Spellscar Desert, renewing the spell as often as necessary until you cease your lawless ways.
