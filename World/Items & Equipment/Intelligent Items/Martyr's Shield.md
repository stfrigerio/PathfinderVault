In addition to good-naturedly attempting to convert you to its religion, the *martyr’s shield* can use 1 reaction each round that, when raised, it uses to [[Shield Block]] to protect an ally adjacent to you, with the effects of the [[Shield Warden]] feat. The *martyr’s shield* uses this reaction whether you would prefer it did so or not. The *martyr’s shield* can be upgraded to a stronger form of *sturdy shield* by paying the difference in cost between its current type of *sturdy shield* and the new type.
