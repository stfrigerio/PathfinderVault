**Perception**: +25; [[Precise]] vision (low-light) 60 feet, [[Imprecise]] hearing 30 feet, imprecise [[Tremorsense]] 30 feet (only when touching the ground)
**Communication**: speech ( [[Arboreal]], [[Common]], [[Sylvan]] ; *[[Speak With Plants]]* )
**Skills**:  [[Diplomacy]] +22, [[Forest Lore]] +25, [[Nature]] +25
**Int**: +4,
**Wis**: +6,
**Cha**: +4
**Will**: +27Rather than passing on when they feel their death approaching, a rare few elderly [[Arboreals]] undergo a ritual of preservation. This rite fuses the arboreal's consciousness into a branch, allowing their spirit to live on within the object. The branch functions as a *[[Greater Verdant Staff]]*, though the arboreal spirit allows only partners willing to safeguard nature to use the staff's spells. An arboreal who decides to become an *arboreal staff* is more connected to shorter-lived species than others of their kind. Most choose to endure to share their knowledge with future generations, but they take a long view in ways that can be frustrating to their wielders.In addition to the activation and spells of a *greater verdant staff* , an *arboreal staff* can cast the spells it holds as if it were the staff's wielder, though it usually does so only to benefit a partner. The staff also has *[[Earthbind]]* available as a 3rd-level spell.
