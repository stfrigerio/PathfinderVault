**Will**: +17A *kindled tome* is a *[[Book Of Lingering Blazes]]* awakened to sapience and imbued with an enthusiasm for fire. It encourages you to learn new [[Fire]] spells to inscribe within its pages. When you attempt a skill check to [[Learn a Spell]] to add a spell with the fire trait to the *kindled tome* , you treat your result as one step better than you rolled. The tome can be disparaging about other spells as “a waste of good page space,” especially if those spells have the [[Cold]] or [[Water]] traits. In addition to the activation of a *book of lingering blazes* , a *kindled tome* has the following activations.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬲{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Trigger**: You Cast a Spell with the fire trait;
**Effect**: The tome makes the flames linger, dealing 2d6 [[Persistent Fire Damage]] to all you hit with or who fail the saving throw against the effect (doubling on a critical success on a spell attack and on a critical failure on a saving throw).

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: The tome casts *[[Fireball]]* at 5th level to your specifications.

```
