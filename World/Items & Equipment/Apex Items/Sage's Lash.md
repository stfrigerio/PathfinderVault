# Sage's Lash

**Item 18**

> The thin, glittering strands of rope that comprise this thick belt appear to be spun gold. Strung along the front of the belt are a collection of four multicolored, perfectly spherical beads: jade, turquoise, quartz, and amethyst. While wearing the lash, you gain a +3 item bonus to [[Religion]]. When you invest the belt, you either increase your Wisdom score by 2 or to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.

title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact; 
**Effect**: You touch one of the jewels affixed to the sage's lash and speak a command word. Depending on the jewel, a different effect is produced that affects you and all living creatures in a 30-foot emanation. After the effect occurs, all four jewels disappear from the lash, reappearing at the next dawn.
