# Viper Rapier

**Item 20**

> Crafted from flawless jade, the guard of this [[Rapier]] takes the form of a twisting serpent with the blade thrusting from its open mouth. This rapier functions as a *+3 [[Greater Striking]] [[Speed]] rapier*. While wielding the rapier, your movement doesn't trigger reactions when you Stride, [[Balance]], or [[Tumble Through]]. When you invest the rapier, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.

**Frequency**: once per day;
**Trigger**: You fail, but don't critically fail, an attack using the *viper rapier*;
**Effect**: The tip of the rapier briefly takes the form of a viper's head, and the blade twists and contorts, biting the target you missed. The target is affected as if successfully poisoned with [[Purple Worm Venom]] (DC 43).
