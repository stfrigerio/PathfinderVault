# Headband of Inspired Wisdom

**Item 17**

> This simple cloth headband remains pristine and clean at all times, no matter the circumstances. When you invest the headband, you either increase your Wisdom score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: When you are considering a course of action, you get a gut feeling about whether it’s a good idea. You gain the effects of an *[[Augury]]* spell, except that you receive the result from your own instincts rather than an external source.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬲{.Pathfinder }* envision (fortune); 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Trigger**: You fail a saving throw against an effect that makes you confused, fascinated, or stupefied;
**Effect**: The *headband of inspired wisdom* clears your mind. You can reroll the saving throw and use the better result.
