# Mercurial Mantle

**Item 18**

> This deep red cloak fits lightly about your shoulders, and the edges perpetually twitch slightly, as though caught in a breeze. The cloth feels smoother than silk, rippling and swaying like liquid when in motion. You feel a lively energy infusing your arms and legs. You gain a +3 item bonus to [[Acrobatics]] and [[Stealth]], and a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against attacks from reactions triggered by your movement.When you invest the cloak, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬲{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Trigger**: An enemy misses you with a melee Strike;
**Effect**: You slip around the attacking creature with ease. You Step, without moving away from the triggering enemy, and then make a melee Strike against the triggering enemy if it's within reach. If you do make a Strike, the target attempts a DC 38 Perception check before you roll.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* command, envision ([[Conjuration]] [[Teleportation]]) 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: The cloak hums with power as your whirl it around yourself, disappearing amid a brief flash of light. Teleport up to double your Speed to a location you can see. At the end of the teleportation, you can make a melee Strike against a creature within reach, if there is one.
