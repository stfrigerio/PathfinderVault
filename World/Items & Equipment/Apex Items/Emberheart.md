# Emberheart

**Item 18**

> This small, heart-shaped amulet appears to be sculpted from stone with a single streak of dim light running through, like an ember just beneath ashes. When worn, the amulet gives off a gentle warmth, akin to being near a fireplace. You gain [[Poison]] resistance 15 when wearing this amulet.When you invest the amulet, you either increase your Constitution score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
