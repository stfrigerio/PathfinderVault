# Troubadour's Cap

**Item 17**

> This jaunty cap can take the form and color of any type of hat you wish upon investing the item, but it always has a peacock feather jutting out from one side. You gain a +2 item bonus to [[Diplomacy]] and [[Performance]] checks while wearing the cap. When you invest the cap, you either increase your Charisma score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.
