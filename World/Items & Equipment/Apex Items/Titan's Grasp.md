You gain a +3 item bonus to [[Athletics]] checks and a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Grapple]]. If you successfully Grapple an enemy that's at least one size category larger than you, the gauntlets dig into it, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier, plus an additional 2d6 on a critical success.When you invest the gloves, you either increase your Strength score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
