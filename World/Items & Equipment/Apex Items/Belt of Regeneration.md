# Belt of Regeneration

**Item 17**

> This belt is crafted from rubbery troll hide that’s green and orange in color. You gain 15 temporary Hit Points the first time you invest the belt in a day. When you invest the belt, you either increase your Constitution score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
