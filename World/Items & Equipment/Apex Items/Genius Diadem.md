> The *genius diadem* is a *[[Nethys/Apex Items/Diadem of Intellect]]* that typically acts like an arrogant professor or mentor, often boasting that it is a certified greater intellect and far superior to your own intelligence, even after the benefits the diadem grants you. The *genius diadem* encourages you to learn things for yourself rather than actually attempting to [[Recall Knowledge]] for you, though you or your allies might be able to play on its arrogance using [[Deception]] to trick it into doing so. In addition to allowing you to activate it, the diadem can use the *diadem of intellect’s*  *[[Hypercognition]]* activation with its own actions, though if it does so, the diadem gains the benefits instead of you. Only the diadem can use the following activation.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**

**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: The *genius diadem* casts 7th-level *[[Feeblemind]]*.

```
