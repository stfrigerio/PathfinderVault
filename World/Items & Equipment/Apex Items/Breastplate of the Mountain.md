# Breastplate of the Mountain

**Item 20**

> Constructed of dull gray metal, this [[Breastplate]] is decorated with the symbol of a craggy black mountaintop. This breastplate functions as a *+3 [[Greater Resilient]] breastplate*. When you're [[Shoved]] or otherwise [[Forced To Move]], you can reduce the amount you move by up to 10 feet. When you invest the breastplate, you either increase your Constitution score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.
