# Shadowmist Cape

**Item 19**

> This black cape flows more like a vaporous liquid than fabric. The cape grants you a +3 item bonus to [[Stealth]] checks. When you invest the cape, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬲{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Trigger**: A creature misses you with an attack;
**Effect**: Attempt a Stealth check against the triggering creature's Perception DC. If you roll a success, you're [[Hidden]] from that creature until the end of your next turn or until right after you use a [[Hostile Action]] against that creature. If you roll a critical success, you're hidden from that creature until the end of your next turn, even if you use hostile actions against that creature.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: With a twirl of the cape, you transform yourself into a puff of gray smoke. You cast *[[Gaseous Form]]* on yourself.
