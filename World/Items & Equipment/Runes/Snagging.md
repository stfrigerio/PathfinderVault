# Snagging

**Item 3**

> This animated item attempts to catch you when you fall. You can attempt to [[Grab An Edge]], even if your hands are tied behind your back or otherwise restrained, so long as there's a solid edge within 10 feet. If you roll a success, you can Grab the Edge even if you don't have a hand free.
