# Kin-Warding

**Item 3**

> A *kin-warding* clan dagger can deflect attacks aimed at your allies. When you use the weapon’s [[Parry]] trait, you can point the clan dagger at an adjacent ally instead of defending yourself, creating a shield of runes around them. The runic barrier grants your ally the weapon’s circumstance bonus to AC, but you do not gain the bonus yourself.
