# Catching

**Item 8**

> A *catching* rune creates a small, magical vacuum that attempts to pull weapons away from opponents. If you can attempt to [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Disarm]] as part of a [[Shield Block]], such as with the [[Disarming Block]] feat or this rune's activated ability, a catching shield grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to such Disarm attempts.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â­“{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Trigger**: You Shield Block a melee Strike made with a held weapon;
**Effect**: You attempt to Disarm the creature whose attack you blocked of the weapon they attacked you with. You can do so even if you don't have a hand free.

```
