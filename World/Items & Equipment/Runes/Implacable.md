# Implacable

**Item 11**

> This substantial rune makes you difficult to hold back. Whenever you are affected by an effect that lasts until you [[Escape]] (for instance, from the [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Grapple]] action or a [[Tanglefoot Bag]] ), you become [[Quickened]]. You can use the extra action each round only to Step or Escape.
