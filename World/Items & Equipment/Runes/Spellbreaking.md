# Spellbreaking

**Item 13**

> Counter-runes specific to a particular school of magic provide protections against that school. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws and AC against one school of magic: [[Abjuration]], [[Magic/Conjuration]], [[Magic/Divination]], [[Magic/Enchantment]], [[Magic/Evocation]], [[Illusion]], [[Necromancy]], or [[Transmutation]]. The crafter chooses the school when creating the rune.
