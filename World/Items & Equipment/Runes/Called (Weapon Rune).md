# Called (Weapon Rune)

**Item 7**

> A *called* weapon can be teleported to its owner's hand.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* command, envision; 
**Effect**: You extend your hand and call the weapon. If the weapon is within 100 feet of you, it appears in your hand even if it was restrained. If the weapon is in another creature's possession, that creature can attempt a Will save against your Will DC. If the creature succeeds, your bond as the owner is broken, and you can't use this activation again until you use the first activation to restore the connection.

```
