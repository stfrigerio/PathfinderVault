# Energy-Resistant

**Item 8+**

> These symbols convey protective forces from the Elemental Planes. You gain resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The crafter chooses the damage type when creating the rune. Multiple *energy-resistant* runes can be etched onto a suit of armor; rather than using only the highest-level effect, each must provide resistance to a different damage type. For instance, a *+2 acid-resistant greater fire-resistant breastplate* would give you acid resistance 5 and fire resistance 10.
