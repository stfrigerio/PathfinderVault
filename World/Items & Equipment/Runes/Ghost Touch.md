# Ghost Touch

**Item 4**

> The weapon can harm creatures without physical form. A *ghost touch* weapon is particularly effective against [[Incorporeal]] creatures, which almost always have a specific vulnerability to *ghost touch* weapons. Incorporeal creatures can touch, hold, and wield *ghost touch* weapons (unlike most physical objects).
