# Fanged

**Item 2+**

> When etched with this rune, a weapon's hilt or haft becomes engraved with grooves that match the imprints of a wolf's teeth. By putting a *fanged* weapon in your mouth, you can transform into an animal.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact ([[Magical]] [[Polymorph]] [[Transmutation]]) 
**Effect**: You transform into a Small or Medium animal that wields the *fanged* weapon in its jaws; the animal matches the animal you are most closely associated with (a [[Lizardfolk]] would turn into a lizard, a [[Kitsune]] into a fox, a [[Deer Instinct]] [[Barbarian]] into a deer, etc.) or a wolf if no specific animal is applicable. While in this form, you can attack with the *fanged* weapon even though you don't have any hands. However, you can attack only with the *fanged* weapon and you don't have hands or the ability to hold items. For effects dependent on how many hands you are using to hold the item, such as the [[Two-Hand]] trait, you are holding the weapon in two hands. You can Dismiss this effect, and it ends automatically if you drop the *fanged* weapon (whether or not of your own volition).
