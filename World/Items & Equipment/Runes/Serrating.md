# Serrating

**Item 10**

> A *serrating* weapon’s bladed edge separates into jagged, swirling shards that spin along the blade. When dealing slashing damage, the weapon deals an additional 1d4 damage.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Effect**: You brandish the weapon and focus its power, causing the serrated shards to buzz as they spin at a dizzying speed. On your next hit with the weapon this turn that deals slashing damage, the *serrating* rune adds an additional 1d12 damage instead of the additional 1d4 damage, and then the shards return to their usual speed.

```
