**Item 9**

*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* command, envision; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You fling your weapon and it multiplies as it flies through the air, filling a 30-foot cone. All creatures within the area take damage equal to double the weapon's number of damage dice, with a DC 27 [[Basic]] Reflex save.
