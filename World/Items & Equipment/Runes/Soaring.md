# Soaring

**Item 14**

> A set of *soaring* armor helps you fly faster and protects you and nearby allies from falling. While wearing *soaring* armor, you gain a +10-foot item bonus to your fly Speed, if you have one. As normal, if your fly Speed is based on your land Speed and you already have an item bonus to your land Speed, these bonuses aren't cumulative.
