# Immovable

**Item 12**

> This rune utilizes magical principles used in an *[[Immovable Rod]]*.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: Your armor anchors you in place, even defying gravity, rendering you [[Immobilized]] until you Dismiss the Activation. while you're immobilized in this way, you can be moved only if a creature succeeds at a DC 40 [[Athletics]] check to [[Force Open]] your armor. You can also be moved if 8,000 pounds of pressure are placed upon you, though this is likely fatal.

```
