# Demolishing

**Item 6**

> A *demolishing* weapon is made to destroy constructs. Damage inflicted on a construct with a *demolishing* weapon continues to spread throughout the creature—cracks form, linkages fail, surfaces erode—and otherwise dismantle its body. When you damage a construct using a *demolishing* weapon, you deal an extra 1d6 persistent force damage. On a critical hit, you deal an extra 1d12 persistent force damage instead.
