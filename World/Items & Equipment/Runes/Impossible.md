# Impossible

**Item 20**

> This rune makes a weapon capable of impossible offense and defense. The etched weapon is immune to *[[Dispel Magic]]* and similar effects that could [[Counteract]] its magic. If it's a ranged weapon or [[Thrown]] weapon, its range increment is doubled.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* command, envision ([[Teleportation]]) 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You and the weapon flash to a perfect attacking position, then return to where you started. Make a Strike with the etched weapon against one creature you can see, even if the target is beyond the weapon's reach or range. On this Strike, ignore any circumstance penalty, status penalty, and range increment penalty.

```
