# Merciful

**Item 4**

>  *Merciful* weapons are sheathed in an unmistakable wispy green aura recognized by both gladiators and guards around the world. A merciful weapon has the [[Nonlethal]] trait and can't be used to make a lethal attack. Any [[Persistent Damage]] the weapon would deal is negated.On a critical hit, a *merciful* weapon causes the target to become [[Fascinated]] with the weapon's wielder for 1 minute, as the target is bombarded with feelings of guilt and remorse. This is a [[Mental]] effect. If you have access to the weapon's [[Critical Specialization Effect]], you choose whether to use it or the merciful effect.
