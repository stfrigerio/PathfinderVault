# Anchoring

**Item 10+**

> This rune prevents enemies from escaping your grasp by fleeing to other planes. If you critically hit a target with an *anchoring* weapon, the weapon casts *[[Dimensional Anchor]]* on the target (DC 27, [[Counteract]] modifier +17).

## Anchoring

**Item 10**

**Price**: 900 gp

## Anchoring (Greater)

**Item 18**

**Price**: 22,000 gpWhen you critically hit a target with a weapon with the anchoring rune, the weapon casts 8th-level *dimensional anchor* on the target (DC 38, counteract modifier +28), except that if the target critically succeeds at its Will save, instead of having no effect, the *dimensional anchor* lasts for 1 round. When you hit a target with the weapon but don't critically hit, the target is affected by 4th-level *dimensional anchor* for 1 round without a save (this still uses a counteract modifier of +28).
