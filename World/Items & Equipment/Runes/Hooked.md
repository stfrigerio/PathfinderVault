# Hooked

**Item 5**

> A *hooked weapon* extends hooks when it's used to attack. A *hooked weapon* gains the [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Trip]] trait. If a *hooked weapon* normally has the trip trait, you can attempt to [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Trip]] a foe as a reaction when you critically hit it with the *hooked weapon*.
