# Energy Adaptive

**Item 13**

> A complex pattern of protective symbols gives protection against various forms of energy, but only part of the runic structure can be active at a given time.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬²{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Trigger**: You take acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage;
**Effect**: You gain resistance 5 to the triggering damage type. This doesn't apply to the triggering damage. This resistance lasts until you Activate this rune again or the armor is no longer invested by you.

```
