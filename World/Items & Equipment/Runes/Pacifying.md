# Pacifying

**Item 5**

> This rune turns weapons into instruments of peacemaking.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬲{.Pathfinder }* command ([[Mental]]) 
**Trigger**: You damage a creature with the etched weapon;
**Effect**: The damaged creature must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be pacified. A pacified creature takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls on any attacks that aren't [[Nonlethal]] for 1 minute, and the creature also experiences a clear psychic warning that they should stop making attacks that could kill.
