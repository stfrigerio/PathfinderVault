# Vorpal

**Item 17**

> Originally created as a means of slaying the legendary jabberwock, *vorpal* weapons prove equally effective against nearly any foe with a head.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬲{.Pathfinder }* envision ([[Death]] [[Incapacitation]]) 
**Trigger**: You roll a natural 20 on a Strike with the weapon, critically succeed, and deal slashing damage. The target must have a head;
**Effect**: The target must succeed at a DC 37 Fortitude save or be decapitated. This kills any creature except ones that don’t require a head to live. For creatures with multiple heads, this usually kills the creature only if you sever its last head.

```
