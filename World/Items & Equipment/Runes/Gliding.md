# Gliding

**Item 8**

> The armor allows you to make a controlled descent.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Effect**: You glide slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down and up to 25 feet forward through the air. Provided you spend at least 1 action gliding on your turn and haven't yet reached the ground, you remain in the air at the end of your turn. Otherwise, you fall.
