# Phoenix Cinder

**Item 16**

> An incandescent, multipronged crystal the color of dying fire, a *phoenix cinder* gives off pleasant warmth and a sense of peace. A low, soft chirruping around the crystal invokes the idea of using fire to cleanse and protect. The crystal offers this power to anyone who touches it. A partaker must be willing to gain the boon's effects.
**Stage 1 (1 Week)**: The first time you enter this stage from a particular *phoenix cinder* , you are affected as if by *[[Regenerate]]*.For 3 days after taking in the cinder, you are immune to [[Fire]]. While in this stage or higher, you have [[Fast Healing]] equal to half your level, as well as resistance to fire damage equal to half your level. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws (or any other defense) against fire. Treat the outcome of any saving throw you roll against fire effects as one step better. You can cast *[[Produce Flame]]* as an innate spell, and you have access to the following activation.
