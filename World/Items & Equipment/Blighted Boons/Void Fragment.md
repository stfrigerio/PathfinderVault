# Void Fragment

**Item 13**

> Hovering midair, thrumming and whispering of its power, a *void fragment* is a crystalline fragment of swirling colors, reminiscent of stars and deep darkness. It thrums intermittently with a beckoning vibration, drawing attention from and pulling at nearby creatures with a tangible sense of gravity. A chill hangs in the air around it. At a touch, the wisp vanishes, giving the point of contact a gangrenous color. If the partaker succeeds at the initial save, the wisp reappears somewhere on the same planet.
**Stage 1 (8 Days)**: The first time you enter this stage from a given void fragment, you gain the effect of a *[[Potion Of Tongues]]* for 3 days. The wisp grants you [[Telepathy]] with a range of 30 feet. Also, you are under the effects of *[[Mind Blank]]*, except that its status bonus is +1 and it [[Counteracts]] with a bonus equal to your class DC – 9. The wisp grants you resistance to [[Mental]] damage equal to half your level. You also have access to the following activation.
