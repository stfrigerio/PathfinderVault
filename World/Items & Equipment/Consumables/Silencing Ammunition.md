# Silencing Ammunition

**Item 9**

>  *Silencing ammunition* is particularly dense and seems to dampen sounds around it. On a successful Strike, an activated piece of *silencing ammunition* creates a 2nd-level *[[Silence]]* effect on the target. The target can resist the effects of the ammunition with a successful DC 25 Will save, though it takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty if the Strike was a critical hit. While the effect is active, the target can use an Interact action to try to tug out the arrow or bolt and end the effect early; this requires a successful DC 25 Will save.
