# Bane Oil

**Item 3**

>  *Bane oil* comes in as many forms as the *[[Bane]]* weapon property rune. Coating a weapon with the oil gives the weapon the benefit of one type of *bane* rune for 1 minute. A weapon can be coated in only one type of *bane oil* at a time. Any new application of this oil supersedes any previous one. If a weapon has the *bane* rune, this oil has no effect if it's of the same type as the rune.
