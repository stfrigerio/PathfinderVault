# Jade Cat

**Item 2**

> A thumb-sized feline carved of rare stone, the *jade cat* is typically worn as a pendant upon a suit of armor. For 1 minute after you activate the cat, you treat all falls as 20 feet shorter, you are not flat-footed when you Balance, and narrow surfaces and uneven ground are not difficult terrain for you.
