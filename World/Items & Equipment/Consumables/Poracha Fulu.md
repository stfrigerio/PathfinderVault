# Poracha Fulu

**Item 5**

> Folklore from near the Forest of Spirits tells of the origin of the *poracha fulu*. Once, a traveler saved an eight-legged feline who turned out to be a [[Poracha]] prince. In return, the prince gave the traveler a fulu that later prevented a fast-acting poison from slaying them. Traditionally, one wears a string of up to nine *poracha fulus* , which counts as one talisman. Each time you take [[Persistent Damage]], one poracha fulu affixed to you negates the damage and crumbles to dust. This response is automatic, but you can use a free action (envision) to prevent your fulus from responding. If you do, any poracha fulus affixed to you never respond to that persistent damage.
