# Enfilading Arrow

**Item 9**

> This arrow splits at the far end of the shaft into five branching arrowheads, making it impractical for single targets but deadly in combat. When you fire an activated *enfilading arrow* , it sails upward and shatters into countless copies. The arrows then rain down in a 10-foot burst at any point within your weapon's first range increment, dealing 6d8 piercing damage to all creatures in the area (DC 25 [[Basic]] Reflex).If a creature critically fails the save and you have access to the [[Bow]] critical specialization effect, the target is [[Immobilized]] and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 Athletics check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds.
