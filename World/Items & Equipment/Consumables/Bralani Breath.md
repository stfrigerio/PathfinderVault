# Bralani Breath

**Item 3+**

>  *Bralani breath* is a species of mint with small, green flowers, said to grow on battlefields where the opposing sides were equally matched. Sprigs of the flowers blow gently in a breeze of their own creation. If you cast *[[Mage Armor]]* using *bralani breath* , you release a small blast of concussive air in an emanation of a size that depends on the catalyst's type. Some unattended objects are pushed away from you. Large or smaller creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save equal to your spell save DC or be [[Pushed]] the same distance away from you.
