# Green Wyrmling Breath Potion

**Item 5**

> This liquid contains blood from a wyrmling [[Green Dragon]]. For 1 hour after you drink it, you can unleash a cloud of poison as a breath weapon. Exhaling dragon breath uses a single action. The breath weapon deals 2d6 poison damage in a 15-foot cone, and each creature in the area must attempt a DC 23 basic Fortitude save. After you use the breath weapon, you can't do so again for 1d4 rounds.
