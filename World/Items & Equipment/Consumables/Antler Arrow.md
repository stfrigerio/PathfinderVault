# Antler Arrow

**Item 2**

> Creation of these arrows was inspired by an encounter with a [[Horned Archon]] scout who sought to peacefully restrain their foes. When an activated *antler arrow* hits a target, bone antlers extend to pin it down. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or become stuck to the surface, taking the critical specialization effects of a [[Bow]].If the hit with the *antler arrow* is a critical hit and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the DC of the [[Athletics]] check increases to 15.
