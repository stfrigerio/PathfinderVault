# Shining Ammunition

**Item 1**

> A piece of *shining ammunition* gives off a faint glow. When shot, this ammunition sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) for 10 minutes. If it hits a target, it sticks, causing the target to shed light in the same radius. A creature can remove the ammunition with an Interact action, but the ammunition itself continues to glow for the rest of the duration or until destroyed.
