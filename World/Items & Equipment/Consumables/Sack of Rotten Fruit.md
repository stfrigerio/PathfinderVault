# Sack of Rotten Fruit

**Item 1**

> Each of these unassuming sacks contains enough rotting fruit to provide a [[Fungus]] [[Leshy]] with 1 week's worth of rations, along with clusters of stones to help press out the fruit's juices. When you Strike a creature with a sack of rotten fruit, the sack is consumed while the creature takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage and must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is [[Sickened 1]]. The [[Range Increment]] of a thrown sack of rotten fruit is 20 feet.
