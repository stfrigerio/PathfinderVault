# Fulus of Concealment

**Item 6**

> This fulu comes in four pieces, one placed in each cardinal direction. Choose one of the following traits when Activating the fulus: [[Animal]], [[Beast]], [[Celestial]], [[Fey]], [[Bestiary/Fiend]], [[Humanoid]], [[Monitor]], [[Plant]], or [[Undead]]. Those within the fulus' circle upon activation (including the fulus themselves) gain the effect of *[[Invisibility Sphere]]*, but only against creatures with the chosen trait. If any of the fulus are moved or destroyed after activation, the effect ends.
