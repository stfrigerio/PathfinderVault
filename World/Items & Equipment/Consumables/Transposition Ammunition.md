# Transposition Ammunition

**Item 9+**

>  *Transposition ammunition* has a milky-white cast and will sometimes shift position subtly of its own accord. When you activate the ammunition, instead of making your Strike against a foe, you fire *transposition ammunition* at any unoccupied square you can see within your weapon's first range increment and succeed without making an attack roll. You pull yourself through the [[Astral Plane]], teleporting along with any items you are holding into the square where you shot the ammunition. If this would carry along any other creature (even one in an [[Extradimensional]] space), the activation fails.

## Transposition Ammunition

**Item 9**

**Price**: 125 gp

## Transposition Ammunition (Greater)

**Item 15**

**Price**: 1,250 gpWhen you teleport, you can take along up to two willing adjacent creatures. These creatures must each arrive in unoccupied squares adjacent to the *transposition ammunition*; if there's not enough space for both of them, you choose which one is teleported.
