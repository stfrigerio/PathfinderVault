# Elysian Dew

**Item 12**

> When you drink sweet, sky-blue *Elysian dew* , for 1 minute, you gain a 10-foot aura that evokes the vitality of [[Elysium]], causing nearby objects to seem more colorful and plants to stand taller. You and any ally that starts its turn in the emanation gain 5 temporary Hit Points, a +1 item bonus to saving throws, and a +1 item bonus to [[Acrobatics]] and [[Athletics]] checks until the start of your or the ally's next turn. If you're evil and drink this potion, it fails to work, and you must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or the potion renders you [[Drained 2]].
