# Stormfeather

**Item 8**

> Even while affixed, this electric blue feather sways lightly in the air, as if always accompanied by a breeze. When activated, the talisman casts *[[Fly]]* on you, though the duration is 1 minute. You can Dismiss this activation. If you do, you're affected by *[[Feather Fall]]*.
