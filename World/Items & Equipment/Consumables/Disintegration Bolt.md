# Disintegration Bolt

**Item 15**

> The shaft of this bolt is scorched and blackened, and handling it coats your fingers with a fine black powder. When an activated *disintegration bolt* hits a target, it is subject to a *[[Disintegrate]]* spell requiring a DC 34 Fortitude save. As with the spell, a critical hit on the attack roll causes the targetâ€™s saving throw outcome to be one degree worse.
**Craft Requirements**: Supply one casting of *disintegrate*.
