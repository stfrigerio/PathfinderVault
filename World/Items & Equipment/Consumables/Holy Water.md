# Holy Water

**Item 1**

> This vial contains water blessed by a good deity. You activate a vial of *holy water* by throwing it as a Strike. It’s a simple thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn’t add the manipulate trait to the attack made with it. *Holy water* deals 1d6 good damage and 1 good splash damage. It damages only fiends, undead, and creatures that have a weakness to good damage.
