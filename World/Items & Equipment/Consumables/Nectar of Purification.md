# Nectar of Purification

**Item 1**

> A shimmering liquid, *nectar of purification* is often stored in bottles similar to those used for vinegar. This oil casts a 1st-level *[[Purify Food And Drink]]* spell over any food or drink onto which itâ€™s poured. The nectar evaporates as it takes effect, leaving the taste and texture of the food or drink unaltered.
