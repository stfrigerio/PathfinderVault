# Gecko Potion

**Item 1**

> A gecko potion is a sticky, tawny brown liquid with flecks of sand suspended in it. For 5 minutes after drinking this potion, your fingertips sprout thousands of microscopic, bristled hairs that cling to objects, granting you a +1 item bonus to [[Climb]] and [[Palm an Object]], and to your Reflex DC against [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Disarm]] attempts.
