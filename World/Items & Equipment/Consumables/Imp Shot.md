# Imp Shot

**Item 5**

> This black-and-red ammunition contains an egg-shaped capsule. When an activated *imp shot* hits, the capsule cracks open and releases a manifestation that resembles a Tiny [[Imp]] that can't act in any way or provide benefits outside those described here. If the Strike misses the target, the imp appears, makes a rude gesture at you, and vanishes in a puff of sulfuric smoke. On a hit, though, the imp harries the target for up to 1 minute, remaining in the target's space, slapping, nipping, hurling insults, and moving with the target as it moves. A creature harried by the imp is [[Flat-Footed]] and takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and skill checks. At the start of your turn on each round while the imp is active, you must attempt a DC 11 flat check. On a failure, the imp makes a final vulgar gesture at the target and vanishes in a cloud of brimstone.
