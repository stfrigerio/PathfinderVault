# Grinning Pugwampi

**Item 14**

> This bone statuette of a sneering gremlin crumbles to dust when activated, imparting a fraction of its subject's infamous misfortune on those you strike. The damaged creature must attempt a DC 33 Will save.
**Critical Success**: The creature is unaffected.
**Success**: The creature must roll twice and take the worse result on the next check it attempts.
**Failure**: The creature must roll twice and take the worse result on all checks until the end of its next turn.
