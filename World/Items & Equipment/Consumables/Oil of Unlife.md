# Oil of Unlife

**Item 1+**

> This thin, black liquid imparts a bone-deep chill while rapidly repairing an [[Undead]] creature's physical or spiritual form. When you dash *oil of unlife* onto an undead creature, or a living creature with [[Negative Healing]], the oil absorbs quickly into its body, and the creature regains the listed number of Hit Points. You can pour *oil of unlife* on an [[Incorporeal]] undead; in this case, the creature absorbs the oil into itself.
