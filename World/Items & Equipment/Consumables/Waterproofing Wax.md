# Waterproofing Wax

**Item 3**

> Many books and spellbooks are treated in this wax formula to protect them from the elements, but *waterproofing wax's* liquid-repellent properties can be further applied to split up a *[[Grease]]* spell into useful smaller sections. When the spell is cast in an area while using this catalyst, the conjured grease fills three 5-foot squares within 30 feet instead of its normal area; these squares don't need to be contiguous.
