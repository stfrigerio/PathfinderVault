# Bronze Bull Pendant

**Item 2**

> This pendant is forged from grainy steel and depicts a snorting bullâ€™s face. The pendant must be attached to the chest area or on a shoulder guard. When you activate the pendant, you gain a +2 status bonus to the Athletics check to Shove, and if you roll a critical failure on the check, you get a failure instead.
