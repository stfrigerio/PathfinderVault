# Tripline Arrow

**Item 2**

> This arrow unspools a line of wire as its flies at its target. The wire animates as it hits a target and attempts to wrap around its legs before vanishing a moment later. If you can apply the bow's [[Critical Specialization Effect]], you can choose to knock the target [[Prone]] instead of pinning the target. If you cannot apply the bow's critical specialization effect, you can instead attempt to use the arrow to [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Trip]] with the [[Athletics]] skill as if the bow had the [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Trip]] weapon trait. The arrow's unwieldy nature halves its weapon's range increment.
