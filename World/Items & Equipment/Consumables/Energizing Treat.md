# Energizing Treat

**Item 7**

> An *energizing treat* is a treat made from meat or grains. When you feed your [[Animal Companion]] or [[Familiar]] an energizing treat, it's [[Quickened]] for 1 minute. It can use the extra action each round only for Strike, Stride, and [[Support]] actions, and it can do so only if it normally has those actions available and you take the proper action to command it.
