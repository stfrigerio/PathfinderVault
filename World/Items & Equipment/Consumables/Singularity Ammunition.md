# Singularity Ammunition

**Item 13**

>  *Singularity ammunition* seems to pull in the light around it, swirling along the surface in a misty pattern. An activated *singularity arrow* creates a strong gravitational force, centered on the creature hit. All creatures in a 10-foot emanation from the target must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be [[Pulled]] 5 feet closer to the target. The singularity then explodes, dealing 7d12 bludgeoning damage to the original target and all creatures in a 5-foot emanation (DC 28 [[Basic]] Reflex save).
