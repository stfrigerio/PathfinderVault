# Basilisk Eye

**Item 9**

> This slimy green stone glows with a strong light whenever the shield it adorns blocks a melee attack. When the eye is activated, the attacker must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or become [[Slowed 1]] for 1 minute as its body slowly stiffens in partial petrification.
