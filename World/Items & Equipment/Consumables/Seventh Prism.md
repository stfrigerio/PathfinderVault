# Seventh Prism

**Item 3+**

> Beloved by the church of the [[Seventh Veil]], a *seventh prism* is a crystal that disperses its internal light, casting an aurora of color. If you use a *seventh prism* to cast *[[Color Spray]]*, targets are [[Dazzled]] for twice as long as their saving throw indicates. On a critical failure, the target is dazzled for 1 minute after its [[Blinded]] condition ends. Motes of shifting rainbow hues cloud the eyes, making it difficult to see details.
