# Ensnaring Disk

**Item 7**

> This coin-sized metal disk is inscribed with arcane symbols and mounted on the inner surface of a shield. When you Activate the disk, the triggering weapon momentarily sticks to your shield, allowing you to attempt to [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Disarm]] it from its wielder with a +2 item bonus. If you roll a critical failure on this check, you get a failure instead.
