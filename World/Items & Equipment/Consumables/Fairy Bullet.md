# Fairy Bullet

**Item 7**

> These bullets are seaweed-green, refract light like an emerald, and are covered in a thin film of gray-green powder. When fired, a *fairy bullet* creates an effect that functions as the *[[Glitterdust]]* spell in a line between you and your target. This line can be no more than 60 feet long, so if the target is more than 60 feet away from you, the line simply ends after reaching its maximum distance. Since the *fairy bullet* is fired before the *glitterdust* can reveal the target, the effects don't affect the flat check for the attack roll with the *fairy bullet*.
