# Weapon-Weird Oil

**Item 7**

> Each dose of *weapon-weird oil* is keyed to a particular melee weapon group, selected from among [[Axe]], [[Brawling]], [[Club]], [[Flail]], [[Hammer]], [[Knife]], [[Pick]], [[Polearm]], [[Shield]], [[Spear]], and [[Sword]]. The oil creates a synergy between skill and weapon, enabling you to wield the weapon in unexpected ways. You must have proficiency with the original weapon to benefit from the oil; however, you use your proficiency rank with the oil's keyed group instead of the weapon's original group. Also, you apply the [[Critical Specialization Effect]] from the oil's keyed group instead of the weapon's normal critical specialization effect. While the oil remains effective, the *[[Grievous]]* rune and similar magic react as if the weapon belongs to the oil's group. A weapon can be coated in only one type of *weapon-weird oil* at a time. Any new application of this oil supersedes any previous one. These effects last for 1 hour.
