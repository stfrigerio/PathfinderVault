# Big Rock Bullet

**Item 7+**

> A *big rock bullet* is a sling bullet made of heavy granite, but each piece of ammunition feels much more dense than it appears. When activated, a *big rock bullet* transforms into a giant rock just before hitting the target. The target takes 4d6 additional bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. Even on a failed attack roll (but not a critical failure), the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. Creatures with the [[Catch Rock]] reaction can use it against a *big rock bullet*.
