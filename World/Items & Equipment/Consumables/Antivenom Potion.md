# Antivenom Potion

**Item 2**

> This cloudy, white liquid helps protect against [[Poisons]]. When you drink an *antivenom potion* , you can immediately attempt a DC 10 flat check to end any [[Persistent Poison Damage]] you're taking. In addition, for 1 minute after drinking the potion, you gain a +1 item bonus to Fortitude saving throws to avoid taking persistent poison damage.
