# Ixamè's Eye

**Item 9**

> Via some strange alchemical reaction with the gasses of Terwa Lake, the [[Cloud Dragon]] Ixamè's eyeballs have shriveled into sky-blue gems. The dragon's sense of vision isn't impaired, and her eyes can't be removed from her head until she's destroyed. Once removed, each gem functions as a special talisman. *Ixamè's eye* sparkles when it's in an area of fog or mist. Activating the talisman enables you to see clearly through fog and mist for 1 minute; any creature [[Concealed]] only by fog or mist is no longer concealed to you. If such a creature was relying on the concealment to [[Hide]] or [[Sneak]], this also means it's no longer [[Hidden]] or [[Undetected]].
