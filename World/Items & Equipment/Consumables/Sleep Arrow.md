# Sleep Arrow

**Item 3**

>  *Sleep arrows* often have shafts of deep blue or black, and their fletching is exceptionally soft and downy. An activated *sleep arrow* deals no damage, but a living creature hit by it is subject to the effects of a *[[Sleep]]* spell (DC 17).
**Craft Requirements**: Supply one casting of *sleep*.
