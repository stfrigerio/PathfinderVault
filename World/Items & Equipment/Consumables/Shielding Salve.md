# Shielding Salve

**Item 1**

> This shimmering paste has many properties of a *[[Shield]]* spell. When you slather it onto a creature or object, the target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC for 1 round. The first time a physical attack or a *[[Magic Missile]]* hits the target during that round, the oil prevents 5 damage from that attack or spell, and then the oil's effect ends.
