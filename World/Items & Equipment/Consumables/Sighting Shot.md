# Sighting Shot

**Item 8**

> Eyes are carved onto a *sighting shot*. When you Activate the ammunition, it glows, shedding [[Bright Light]] for 20 feet and [[Dim Light]] for 20 feet beyond that. If you shot the activated ammunition, your mind swirls with images of what the *sighting shot* passed and hit as if you sprinted along the ammunition's course. You see this path as if with your normal visual senses. Once a *sighting shot* hits anything or reaches its maximum range, it stops transmitting images to you. A *sighting shot's* light is visible to creatures who didn't Activate the ammunition, but they receive no special information from it.
