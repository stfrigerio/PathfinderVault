# Celestial Hair

**Item 20**

> This strand of hair shimmers like the strands of fate. When you activate the string, it resonates with a single, perfect note. The triggering saving throw becomes a failure or the triggering attack roll becomes a regular hit, not critical one. If the source of the attack or effect is an evil creature, that creature must succeed at a DC 41 Will saving throw or be [[Enfeebled 2]] and [[Stupefied 2]] until the end of its next turn.
