# Kaiju Fulu

**Item 13**

> Despite the name, a *kaiju fulu* protects a building against damage of all sorts. When an affixed structure no larger than 100 feet Ã— 100 feet and up to 50 feet tall takes damage, the structure is as hard as [[Standard-Grade Adamantine]] against that damage and any damage that occurs within 1 hour thereafter. The fulu then crumbles to dust, and its effects end.
