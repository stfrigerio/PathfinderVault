# Ghost Courier Fulu

**Item 8**

> The inscription on a *ghost courier fulu* leaves space for a message, and a prominent red stamp indicates which *[[Ghost Delivery Fulu]]* this fulu homes in on. When you Activate this fulu, you dictate a message up to 25 words long that then magically appears on the paper in the language you spoke. The fulu then disappears into the [[Ethereal Plane]], arriving at the assigned *ghost delivery fulu* in 2d10 hours, provided that fulu is within 500 miles. There, the fulu's magic dissipates, but the message remains. If the fulu takes any damage in transit, it has a 50% chance to drop back into the [[Material Plane]], intact but bereft of magic.
