# Swirling Sand

**Item 7**

>  *Swirling sand* carries a faint trace of strange compulsions from the helical sand spire near Beachcomber. Adding this catalyst to a *[[Suggestion]]* spell implants a strange compulsion in one target of the spell. The target creature must spin counterclockwise at the end of its turn if it didn't take a [[Move]] action that turn. This spin is a free action that has the move trait. This effect lasts for 3 rounds on a success, failure, or critical failure against suggestion (even if the target completes its suggestion in fewer rounds); a target that critically succeeds against *suggestion* is unaffected by the *swirling sand*.
