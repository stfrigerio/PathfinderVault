# Awakened Metal Shot

**Item 17+**

> These bullets are formed from a liquefied high-grade precious metal and enchanted to unlock that metal's true potential. Each version has a different special effect.

## Awakened Metal Shot (Awakened Adamantine Shot)

**Item 18**

**Price**: 3,500 gpThe shot is a high-grade [[Adamantine]] bullet. The awakened adamantine breaks through any resistance. The shot ignores the first 20 resistance a creature has to physical damage, all damage, or piercing or bludgeoning damage. Against a [[Golem]] or creature who already has a resistance bypassed by adamantine, or a weakness to adamantine, the shot shatters the target's defenses, causing them to become [[Flat-Footed]] for 1 minute instead. Because adamantine is uncommon, this version of *awakened metal shot* is uncommon even for gunslingers or other characters with access to uncommon guns and bullets from this book.

## Awakened Metal Shot (Awakened Cold Iron Shot)

**Item 17**

**Price**: 2,300 gpThe shot is a high-grade [[Cold Iron]] bullet. The awakened cold iron attempts to disrupt [[Enchantments]] the target placed on others' minds. You can name a creature you believe to be enchanted by your target or allow the shot to choose an enchanted creature randomly. On a hit, the shot attempts to [[Counteract]] the enchantment the target is using to manipulate that creature's mind. The counteract level is 9, and the counteract modifier is +27. If you fail (but don't critically fail) the counteract check against a [[Demon]] or [[Fey]], you get a success instead. If you hit a demon or fey with no active enchantment effects on other creatures, the target is [[Stupefied 1]] for 1 minute instead.

## Awakened Metal Shot (Awakened Silver Shot)

**Item 17**

**Price**: 2,300 gpThe shot is a high-grade [[Silver]] bullet. The awakened silver gleams with altered celestial moonlight designed to weaken and expose [[Devils]] and [[Werecreatures]]. On a hit, it attempts to [[Counteract]] any [[Polymorph]] effect on the target. The counteract level is 9, and the counteract modifier is +27. If you fail (but don't critically fail) the counteract check against a devil or a werecreature, you get a success instead. If you counteracted the [[Change Shape]] ability, the creature can't use that ability again for 1 round, or 1 minute on a critical success. If you hit a devil or werecreature not under a polymorph effect, the target is [[Enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute instead.
