# Fearcracker

**Item 5**

> A *fearcracker* contains fragments of broken mirrors and reagents that pop and smoke when consumed. When thrown down in your space as part of a *[[Mirror Image]]* spell, your and your images' appearance twists nightmarishly. When an image is destroyed, it “dies” in a disturbing fashion, rendering the attacker [[Frightened 1]]. This aspect of the spell has the [[Emotion]], [[Fear]], and [[Mental]] traits.
