# Potion of Grounding

**Item 10**

> Sparks flash within this amber syrup. Drinking this potion turns you into a living lightning rod for 1 minute, drawing nearby electricity to strike you instead of allies. You gain the following reaction while the effect lasts.
**Divert Lightning**: 
( [[Electricity]] )
**Requirements**: You aren't immune to electricity;
**Trigger**: A creature within 30 feet of you is targeted by an electricity effect or is in the area of an electricity effect.
**Effect**: You draw the electricity to yourself like a lightning rod in order to shield the target. If the triggering effect was targeted, it targets you instead of the triggering creature. If it was an area effect, it leaps from the triggering creature's space to fill your space instead. This doesn't divert lightning from any other creatures targeted by or in the area of the lightning. You're automatically hit by or automatically fail your save against the effect. You then can't Divert Lightning for 1d4 rounds.
