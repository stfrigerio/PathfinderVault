# Garrote Shot

**Item 15**

> Wiry designs mark the silvery coating on a *garrote shot*. When the activated ammunition hits a target, it transforms into a silvery garrote that wraps around one of the target's appendages, dealing 2d12 [[Persistent Slashing Damage]]. On a critical hit, it wraps around the target's throat if it has one, and the target [[Can'T Breathe]] until the persistent damage ends. If the persistent damage kills the target, the garrote severs the appendage it's wrapped around.
