# Corpsecaller Round

**Item 9**

> This bullet is crafted entirely from obsidian and engraved with hair-thin runes. When an activated *corpsecaller round* hits a target, the struck creature is called to the grave. It takes 4d10 negative damage with a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw.
**Critical Success**: The foe is unaffected.
**Success**: The foe takes half damage.
**Failure**: The foe takes full damage and is [[Doomed 1]]. If the foe dies within the next 24 hours, its corpse is tethered to the [[Negative Energy Plane]], making it easier to raise as an [[Undead]]. Creatures using the *[[Create Undead]]* ritual on the foe's corpse receive a +2 circumstance bonus to their primary and secondary skill checks for the ritual.
**Critical Failure**: As failure, except the foe takes double damage and is doomed 2.
