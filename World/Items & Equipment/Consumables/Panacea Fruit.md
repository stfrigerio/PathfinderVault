# Panacea Fruit

**Item 19**

> This fruit is slowly, constantly changing shape, transforming from one fruit into another, but always appearing at the peak of ripeness. When you consume the fruit, it attempts to [[Counteract]] all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting you, and you immediately regain 8d8+30 Hit Points. The fruit has a counteract level of 9 and a +30 modifier for the rolls against each condition. The fruit's seed remains after consumption and can be planted later, becoming a seed-shaped *[[Tree Feather Token]]* that sprouts a tree bearing many kinds of mundane fruit.
