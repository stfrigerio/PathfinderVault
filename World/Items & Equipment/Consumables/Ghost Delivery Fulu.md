# Ghost Delivery Fulu

**Item 8**

> A *ghost delivery fulu's* inscription resembles a dovecote with spirits around it, and it has a prominent stamp in red wax. This fulu activates once affixed, becoming the homing location of *[[Ghost Courier Fulus]]* with a matching stamp. Delivered *ghost courier fulu* messages stick to the *ghost delivery fulu* but can be easily removed.
