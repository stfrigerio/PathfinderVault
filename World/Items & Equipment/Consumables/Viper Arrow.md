# Viper Arrow

**Item 4**

> The shaft of this arrow is covered in fine green scales, and its iron head comes to a pair of points almost like fangs. After an activated *viper arrow* hits a target, the arrow transforms into a [[Viper]]. The target is affected by the viper's poison, as if it had been bitten. The viper then lands in an open space adjacent to the target.The viper has the [[Summoned]] trait and acts at the end of your turn, even though you didn't use the Sustain a Spell action. It is under the GM's control, but it generally attacks the creature the arrow struck. The viper vanishes after 1 minute or when slain.
**Craft Requirements**: Supply one casting of *[[Summon Animal]]*.
