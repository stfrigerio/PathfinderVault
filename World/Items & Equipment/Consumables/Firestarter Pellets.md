# Firestarter Pellets

**Item 5+**

> These compacted pellets of bat guano, sulfur, and magical accelerants have long been a staple for spellcasters on the battlefield. Adding a *firestarter pellet* to a *[[Fireball]]* spell produces clinging flames that deal [[Persistent Fire Damage]] to all who fail the saving throw against the effect (doubling on a critical failure).
