# Potion of Stable Form

**Item 10+**

> This aromatic potion is brewed from the white flowers and black roots of the magical herb moly. When you drink this potion, it immediately attempts to counteract all hostile [[Transmutation]] effects affecting you. For the next hour, you gain an item bonus against transmutation effects, which is greater against [[Polymorph]] effects. If you roll a success against a polymorph effect during that time, you get a critical success instead.
