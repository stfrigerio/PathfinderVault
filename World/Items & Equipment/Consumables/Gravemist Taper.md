# Gravemist Taper

**Item 5**

> A *gravemist taper* is a conical candle with symbols of terror and death carved into the wax. The taper can be used as a catalyst when casting an *[[Obscuring Mist]]* spell, burning the taper away, coloring the mist gray, and filling the mist with ghastly, shadowy shapes. The flat check to overcome the [[Concealed]] state from the mist rises to 7, and a creature who fails such a check becomes [[Frightened 1]]. This aspect of the spell has the [[Emotion]], [[Fear]], and [[Mental]] traits.
