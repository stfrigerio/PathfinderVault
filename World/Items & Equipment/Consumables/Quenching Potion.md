# Quenching Potion

**Item 8**

>  *Quenching potion* is a clear liquid that tastes like fresh, cool spring water. Drinking this potion or pouring it over yourself completely hydrates you and cleanses your system. Immediately attempt a flat check to end any [[Persistent Acid, Fire, Negative, Or Poison Damage]] affecting you, and attempt a new saving throw against any [[Poison]] affecting you. Poison can't progress to a worse stage due to this saving throw. The potion counts as a particularly appropriate type of help against persistent acid, fire, negative, and poison damage.
