# Oil of Potency

**Item 2**

> When you apply this thick, viscous oil to a weapon or suit of armor, that item immediately becomes magically potent. If the item is a weapon, it temporarily becomes a *+1 [[Striking]] weapon* , or, if it's armor, it temporarily becomes *+1 [[Resilient]] armor*. This lasts for 1 minute.
