# Black Tendril Shot

**Item 7+**

> A glistening, tar-like substance that's displeasing to the touch coats a *black tendril shot*. When the activated ammunition hits a target, it exudes tendrils that encase the target, which must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. The ammunition's effects last until the target [[Escapes]]. DCs for the saving throw and Escape vary by type.
**Critical Success**: The target is unaffected.
**Success**: The target is [[Slowed 1]] but gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Escape the ammunition's effect.
**Failure**: The target is slowed 1.
**Critical Failure**: The target is slowed 2.
