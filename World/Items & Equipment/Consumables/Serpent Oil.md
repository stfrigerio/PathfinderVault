# Serpent Oil

**Item 3+**

> This glistening oil has a green hue and tiny snake scales floating within. If you slather *serpent oil* on a Tiny object that is snakelike in shape, from a stick to a scarf, the object transforms into a [[Viper]], keeping some of the same colors and patterns of the original item. If placed on other objects, the oil fails and is wasted. This false snake has the [[Minion]] trait. It remains in snake form for 1 minute before returning to its object state. If slain, the item returns to its original form, unharmed.
