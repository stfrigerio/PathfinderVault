# Force Tiles

**Item 13**

> Light refracts in strange ways through these precisely ground glass tiles, lengthening the refracted force and causing it to push back. Adding this catalyst to a *[[Wall Of Force]]* spell increases the wall's maximum length to 80 feet and maximum height to 40 feet and causes creatures that try to move into the wall's space (or are [[Shoved]] into the wall) to take 2d6 [[Force]] damage.
