# Soothing Scents

**Item 3**

> Performers popularized these bundles of aromatic herbs to calm the mind and ward off misfortune before a big show, though soldier bards have found them especially useful for clearing fear during particularly tumultuous battles. Adding this catalyst to a *[[Soothe]]* spell also causes the spell to reduce the target's [[Frightened]] condition value by 1.
