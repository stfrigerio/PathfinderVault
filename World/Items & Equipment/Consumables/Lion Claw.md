# Lion Claw

**Item 11**

> This dried claw from a mighty beast bestows upon you the ability of a predator. When you activate the claw, you learn to pounce on your prey in one fluid motion. You Stride and then Strike with the affixed weapon against one creature you were undetected by. You remain undetected by the creature until after you Strike.
