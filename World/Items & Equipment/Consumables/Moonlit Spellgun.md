# Moonlit Spellgun

**Item 2+**

> Elegant silver filigree contains the body of this ephemeral item, which is made of solid light. Its shape resembles a pistol, and it's often carried by hunters of [[Werecreatures]], [[Vampires]], and [[Devils]]. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target's AC. This spellgun has a [[Range Increment]] of 30 feet. The spellgun emits a silvery ray of pure moonlight that deals fire damage depending on its type. The spellgun's damage is treated as [[Silver]] for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like.
**Critical Success**: The target takes double damage and is [[Dazzled]] until the start of your next turn. If it has a weakness to silver or a resistance that can be bypassed by silver, it's also enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.
**Success**: The target takes full damage and is dazzled until the start of your next turn.
