# Grave Token

**Item 4**

> This simple charm is made from compacted grave dirt infused with bone dust. A *[[Harm]]* spell that's empowered by this catalyst can reach faraway targets. If the *harm* spell is cast with 1 action, its range is 30 feet; if it's cast with 2 actions, its range is 60 feet. This has no effect on the three-action area version of *harm* , though in most cases, you don't have enough actions to Activate the token and cast a three-action *harm* anyway.
