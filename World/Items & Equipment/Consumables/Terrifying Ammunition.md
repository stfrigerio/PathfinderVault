# Terrifying Ammunition

**Item 6**

> This black-and-gray ammunition is etched with occult symbols and tiny, grinning skulls. When activated *terrifying ammunition* damages a creature, it fills the creature's mind with visions of their own failures, tragedies, and eventually, their own death. The creature must attempt a DC 20 Will save.
**Critical Success**: The creature is unaffected.
**Success**: The creature is [[Frightened 1]].
**Failure**: The creature is frightened 1 and can't reduce its frightened value below 1 until it spends an action, which has the [[Concentrate]] trait, to calm itself down.
**Critical Failure**: As failure, but the creature is frightened 2.
