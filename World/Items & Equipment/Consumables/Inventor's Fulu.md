# Inventor's Fulu

**Item 6**

> Some [[Inventors]] in Tian Xia put fried snacks near their innovations, a charm to make devices behave as intended. The practice rubbed off on other inventors, who replaced the food with a drawing on an *inventor's fulu*. When you Activate the fulu, your critical failure becomes a failure, and you can spend just 1 minute to return your innovation to full functionality. The fulu then burns up, and its effects end.
