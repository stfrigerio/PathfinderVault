# Immovable Potion

**Item 10**

> When you drink the thick, slate-colored *immovable potion* , you become anchored in place, even defying gravity, rendering you [[Immobilized]] for 1 minute or until you Dismiss the activation. While you are immobilized this way, the DC to move you from your place, including knocking you [[Prone]], is 40.
