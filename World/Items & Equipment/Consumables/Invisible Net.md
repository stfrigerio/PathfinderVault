# Invisible Net

**Item 7**

> You activate this folded lace handkerchief by spreading it out on the ground, where it grows to cover a 30-foot-by- 30-foot square area. Pale and diaphanous, the spread handkerchief is exceptionally difficult to see from more than 30 feet away and evaporates entirely after 1 minute. Any creature that falls on the net doesnâ€™t take falling damage.
