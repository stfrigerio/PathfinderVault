# Potion of Undetectability

**Item 18**

> Drinking this dull-black liquid makes you undetectable to divinations. This grants the same effects as *[[Mind Blank]]*, but without the bonus against mental effects. You also gain the effects of a 4th-level *[[Invisibility]]* spell, which protects against *[[See Invisibility]]* spells of 8th level and lower and has a DC of 36 against *[[True Seeing]]*. The potionâ€™s effects last for 10 minutes.
