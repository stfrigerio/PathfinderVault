# Captivating Score

**Item 11**

> A *captivating score* is a piece of parchment prepared for musical notation, long enough for a short song. You must be trained in [[Performance]] to properly compose this missive (or trained in an appropriate [[Lore]] skill your GM allows). You choose one of the emotions described below and write a musical composition to convey that emotion about a subject of your choice, typically a person or group. When activated, the missive plays a note-perfect rendition of the inscribed score. Each creature that can hear the score must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be influenced to feel the emotion you chose toward the subject of your composition. This lasts for 1 hour, typically returning the creature to its initial attitude unless new events have altered their attitude long-term.When composing this missive, you can add a small notation or illustration of a type of instrument. If you do, the music sounds like that instrument, and if you didn't specify, it sounds vaguely like a recorder. The choice of a louder instrument doesn't make the music carry farther.
