# Shimmering Dust

**Item 5**

> This luminous mica dust fluoresces for a short time after being exposed to significant amounts of magical energy. When a creature fails its save against a cloud of *[[Glitterdust]]* created using this catalyst, glowing grains stick to them, causing them to shed dim light in a 20-foot radius for as long as their invisibility is negated by the spell as well as causing them to take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to [[Stealth]] for that duration.
