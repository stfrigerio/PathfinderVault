# Beckoning Cat Amulet

**Item 5**

> This clay figurine resembles a white cat with a paw outstretched. When itâ€™s activated, any allies within 10 feet who also just failed or critically failed a Reflex saving throw from the same source (such as a *[[Fireball]]* spell) can also reroll their saving throw and use the better result.
