# Putrescent Glob

**Item 7**

> This repulsive, hairy glob dangles from the end of your weapon. When you activate the *putrescent glob* , the creature you damaged must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or its [[Sickened]] condition increases to sickened 2, and it can't reduce its sickened condition until the end of its next turn. On a critical failure, it's also [[Slowed 1]] until the end of its next turn.
