# Golden Chrysalis

**Item 5**

> Threads of iridescent golden silk wrap around the core of this magical [[Sling Stone]]. When you activate and shoot a *golden chrysalis* , rather than making an attack roll for your Strike, you cause the chrysalis to unwind in midair to reveal a magical butterfly that flies in a 30-foot line, scattering golden scale dust that hangs in the air for 1 minute.A creature that enters or begins its turn in the dust must attempt a DC 19 Reflex save or have its invisibility negated, becoming [[Concealed]] instead of [[Invisible]]. This effect applies both if the creature was already invisible and if it benefits from any new invisibility effects before the end of the invisibility negation effect from the *golden chrysalis*.
**Critical Success**: The target is unaffected.
**Success**: The target's invisibility is negated for 2 rounds.
**Failure**: The target is [[Dazzled]] for 1 minute and its invisibility is negated for 1 minute.
