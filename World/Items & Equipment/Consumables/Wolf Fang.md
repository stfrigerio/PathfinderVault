# Wolf Fang

**Item 1**

> This wolf canine is bound in a strip of leather and tied to a buckle or strap of a suit of armor. When you activate the fang, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier to the target of your Trip. If your Trip would already deal physical damage that doesnâ€™t include an ability modifier, add your Strength modifier to that damage.
