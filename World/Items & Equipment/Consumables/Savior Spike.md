# Savior Spike

**Item 2**

> This pyramid-shaped spike is attached to an armorâ€™s chest piece. When you activate the spike, it shoots a strand of force to help you gain purchase. If you roll a success on the triggering attempt, you get a critical success instead (if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead).
