# Oil of Skating

**Item 2**

> This thin, slippery oil shimmers with a golden hue. Coating your shoes or feet with *oil of skating* enables you to skate quickly along flat surfaces for 1 hour. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed, which doubles if you move on a downhill surface. You lose this bonus if moving on difficult terrain, greater difficult terrain, or [[Uneven Ground]]. Also, you treat any uphill movement as moving on difficult terrain while your feet are oiled and treat the results of any [[Acrobatics]] checks made to [[Balance]] as one degree worse.
