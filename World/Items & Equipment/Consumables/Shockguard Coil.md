# Shockguard Coil

**Item 10**

> This miniature Stasian coil talisman emits small sparks when jostled. It uses a combination of Stasian technology and evocation magic to erupt in electricity when discharged. When you activate the coil, the foe takes 2d12 electricity damage (DC 27 [[Basic]] Reflex save). On a failed save, the foe is [[Flat-Footed]] until the start of its next turn.
