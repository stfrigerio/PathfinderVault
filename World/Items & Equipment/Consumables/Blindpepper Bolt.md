# Blindpepper Bolt

**Item 3**

> The head of this bolt is a vented container that smells strongly of caustic pepper. When an activated *blindpepper bolt* hits a target, it deals no damage; instead the creature must attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save. If the Strike was a critical success, the target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its Fortitude save. At the GM's discretion, a creature with no eyes or olfactory organs might not be affected by this item.
**Critical Success**: The target is unaffected.
**Success**: The target is [[Dazzled]] until the end of your next turn. It can end the effect early if it spends an action, which has the [[Manipulate]] trait, to wipe down its eyes.
**Failure**: The target is dazzled for 1 minute.
**Critical Failure**: The target is [[Blinded]] until the end of your next turn and dazzled for 1 minute.
