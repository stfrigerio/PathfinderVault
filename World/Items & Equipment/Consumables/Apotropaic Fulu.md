# Apotropaic Fulu

**Item 5**

> This unassuming yellow paper, affixed above a door or gate, flickers in the light. Pick an alignment trait: [[Chaotic]], [[Good]], [[Lawful]], or [[Evil]]. When a creature with the opposing alignment trait of the fulu (good for an evil fulu, and so on) passes through the entrance, it must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or become [[Sickened 2]] ; regardless of whether they succeed, the creature becomes temporarily immune for 1 day.
