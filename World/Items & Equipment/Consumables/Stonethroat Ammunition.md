# Stonethroat Ammunition

**Item 12**

> Each piece of *stonethroat ammunition* is tipped with an unusual yellow stone. When an activated piece of *stonethroat ammunition* hits a target, the target must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save.
**Critical Success**: The creature is unaffected.
**Success**: The ammunition lodges itself loosely into the target's throat. For 1 round, the target takes a â€“2 status penalty to attack rolls with its jaws or fangs, and to [[Athletics]] checks.
**Failure**: The ammunition embeds itself deep in the target's throat. The target can't use its jaws or fangs Strike (if it has one) or the [[Swallow Whole]] ability until the end of its next turn.
**Critical Failure**: As failure, and the target is [[Enfeebled 2]] for 1 round.
