# Rhino Hide Brooch

**Item 5**

> This thick brooch is carved from a single piece of rhino hide. It's lacquered and covered in a thin layer of silver dust. When activated, the talisman grants you resistance 5 to physical damage until the end of the current creature's turn. This resistance applies to the triggering attack.
