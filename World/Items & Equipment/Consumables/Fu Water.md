# Fu Water

**Item 5**

> Burnt fulu ashes float in this liquid, lending a distinctive red color and imparting it with a variety of purifying effects. Unlike many [[Fulu]] items, *fu water* must be created using [[Divine]] magic.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Effect**: This potion functions as a bottle of *[[Holy Water]]*. Like holy water, you throw it as a Strike. It's a simple [[Thrown]] weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the [[Manipulate]] trait to the attack made with it.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Effect**: You drink the *fu water* to [[Counteract]] ailments within yourself. Attempt a [[Counteract]] check with a +9 counteract modifier and a counteract level of 3 against one effect that imposes the [[Confused]], [[Fascinated]], [[Frightened]], or [[Stupefied]] condition. You are then [[Sickened 1]].

```
