# Garrote Bolt

**Item 15**

> The shaft of this silver bolt is engraved with wiry designs. When a *garrote bolt* hits a target, it transforms into a silver garrote and wraps around one of the target's appendages, dealing an additional 2d12 [[Persistent Slashing Damage]]. On a critical hit, it wraps around the target's throat, and the target can't breathe until the persistent damage ends.
