# Discord Fulu

**Item 5**

> Incorporating green in its writing, a *discord fulu* is a popular but unethical tool often deployed on romantic rivals to foil their advances. While the fulu is affixed to it, a creature treats its attitude toward other creatures as one step worse than it is. The creature also takes a â€“1 status penalty to [[Diplomacy]] checks. The first failure the creature rolls on a Diplomacy check becomes a critical failure instead, and the fulu turns to ash, ending its effect.
