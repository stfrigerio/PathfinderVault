# Bottled Screams

**Item 10**

> The vengeful wails of a [[Revenant]], barely contained in this rattling jar, infuse your magic with all of their spite and malice. If a target fails its saving throw against your *[[Seal Fate]]* spell after you've added this catalyst, it takes 1d6 [[Persistent Damage]] of the type chosen for the spell (2d6 if it critically fails).
