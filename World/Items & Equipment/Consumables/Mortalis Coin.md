# Mortalis Coin

**Item 4**

> This small golden coin is usually stamped with the image of a boar or other resilient creature. If the triggering damage would cause you to become [[Dying 2]] (typically due to a critical hit or your critical failure), you become dying 1 instead. In addition, for 10 minutes, you die from the dying condition at dying 5, rather than dying 4.
