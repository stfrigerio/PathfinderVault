# Beacon Shot

**Item 3**

> The shaft of a *beacon shot* is studded with tiny flecks of glimmering gemstones. When an activated *beacon shot* hits a target, it embeds itself into that target and spews sparks for 1 minute. If the target is invisible, it becomes merely hidden to creatures who would otherwise be unable to see it. The sparks also negate the concealed condition if the target was otherwise concealed.A creature can remove the arrow or bolt by using an Interact basic action and succeeding at a DC 20 Athletics check.
