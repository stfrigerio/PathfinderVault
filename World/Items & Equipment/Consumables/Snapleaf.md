# Snapleaf

**Item 3**

> This small, crystalline carving takes the shape of a tree leaf and attaches to armor or clothing with a simple strap. When you activate the *snapleaf* , you gain the benefits of *[[Feather Fall]]* and a 2nd-level *[[Invisibility]]* spell for 1 minute or until you stop falling, whichever comes first.
