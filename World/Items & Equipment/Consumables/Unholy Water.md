# Unholy Water

**Item 1**

> An evil deity’s malice lies within this vial of water. You activate a vial of *unholy water* by throwing it as a Strike. It’s a simple thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn’t add the manipulate trait to the attack made with it. *Unholy water* deals 1d6 evil damage and 1 evil splash damage. It damages only celestials and creatures that have a weakness to evil damage.
