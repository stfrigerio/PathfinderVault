# Cayden's Brew

**Item 8+**

>  *Cayden's brew* is like rich beer or ale, with a golden-brown color and foamy head. For 1 hour after you drink it, you have a +1 item bonus to saving throws against [[Fear]] effects. Also, you can use a single action to breathe out a 15-foot cone of intoxicating vapor with a burp that can be heard for 100 feet. Any creature in the vapor must attempt a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw. After you use this breath weapon, you can't do so again for 1d4 rounds.
**Critical Success**: The creature is unaffected.
**Success**: The creature is [[Clumsy 1]] and [[Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.
**Failure**: The creature is clumsy 1 and stupefied 1 for 1d4 rounds.
**Critical Failure**: The creature becomes clumsy 2, stupefied 2, and [[Sickened 1]]. The clumsy and stupefied conditions last until 1d4 rounds after the sickened condition ends.
