# Golden Silencer

**Item 6+**

> The Golden Gunners are dreaded for their use of their *golden silencers* , which they put to good use in clandestine raids. They silence both the loud gunshot and the screams of creatures wounded by its shot. A weapon with a *golden silencer* attached emits no light and makes no noise when fired. A target hit by a ranged Strike from the affixed weapon must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be silenced as well until the start of its next turn. A silenced creature can't call for help or use sonic abilities, nor can it use abilities with the [[Auditory]] trait. This prevents it from casting spells that include verbal components.

## Golden Silencer (Standard)

**Item 10**

**Price**: 200 gp

The save DC is 27, and the silence effect on the target creature lasts for up to 1 minute. The silenced creature can attempt a new Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns to end the duration early.
