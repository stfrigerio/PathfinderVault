# Horned Lion Amulet

**Item 9**

> This small figurine of a horned lion sitting at attention is the size of a coin and carved from simple stone. The figurine can be fastened to a suit of armor as a charm or adornment. When you activate the amulet, the lion's eyes glow with flames, granting you fire resistance 10 against the triggering damage and a subsequent fire resistance 5 for 1 minute. If the triggering damage was due to [[Persistent Fire Damage]], you immediately attempt a DC 10 flat check to recover from the persistent damage. The DC remains at 10 until the persistent fire damage ends.
