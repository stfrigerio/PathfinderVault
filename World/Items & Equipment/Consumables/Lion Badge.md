# Lion Badge

**Item 4**

> This plain wooden badge has the face of a roaring lion etched onto its surface. When you activate this talisman, reduce the value of your frightened condition by 1 (to a minimum of 0). When this talisman is used, the image of the lion fades and the item becomes a plain, non-magical wooden badge.
