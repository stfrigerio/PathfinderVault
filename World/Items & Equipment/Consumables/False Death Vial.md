# False Death Vial

**Item 13+**

> This tiny crystal vial of oily liquid is typically attached to a pin or worn on a tether attached to the affixed article of clothing. When you Activate the vial, you avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point, your [[Wounded]] condition increases by 1, and the talisman casts *[[Drop Dead]]* on you. You and any items you're wearing and holding are instantly transported from your current space to a clear space of your choice within 30 feet. You take no damage from the triggering effect. If you are carrying another creature (even one contained inside an [[Extradimensional]] container), it's left behind in your original space.
