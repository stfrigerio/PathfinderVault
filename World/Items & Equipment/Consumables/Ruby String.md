# Ruby String

**Item 14**

> The frayed threads from the rips and tears in *Hao Jin's Tapestry* still contain traces of the Ruby Phoenix's magic. Hao Jin has collected most of these loose strings, but others occasionally find these potent silk strands in unexpected places. A ruby string can fulfill the cost requirement for an 8th-level *[[Create Demiplane]]* ritual. When used in this way, the ruby string negates the need for secondary casters, and you get a success for all secondary checks. Alternatively, you can activate it to create a smaller demiplane without requiring the ritual.
**Activate**: 8 hours (envision, Interact);
**Effect**: You spin the thread to form a demiplane with the effects of a successful 8th-level *create demiplane* , but the space is a single 10-foot cube.
