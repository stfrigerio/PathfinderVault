# Unending Youth

**Item 20**

> You cease aging, and if you were older than young adult in age, you become a young adult again. You gain a +4 status bonus to saves against [[Death]] effects and resistance to negative damage equal to half your level. Once per day, from any distance, Abrogail Thrune II can recite a mandatory appearance clause in your Thrune contract as a 3-action activity to summon you to her side, where you are [[Controlled]] by Abrogail for 1 minute before you return.

```ad-embed-ability

**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You recite a hold harmless provision from your Thrune contract. Reduce your [[Doomed]] value to 0. Abrogail Thrune II is immediately made aware that you have used this ability.
