# Cryolite Eye

**Item 6**

> You tore your eye from the socket and offered it to whatever spirit would take it. In return, you received a glass eye in its place. This eye allows you to see as normal, and when you succeed at a Perception check against an [[Illusion]], you get a critical success instead. Once per day, from any distance, the entity that holds your bargained contract can overwhelm your *cryolite eye* with magical energy, causing images to float over your vision that inflict the [[Dazzled]] condition on you for 1 minute.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You look through the glass eye sealing your *bargained contract*. The contract casts *[[See Invisibility]]* affecting you.

```
