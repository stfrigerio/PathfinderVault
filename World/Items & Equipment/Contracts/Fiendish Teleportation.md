# Fiendish Teleportation

**Item 11**

> You tap into the fiendish ability to slip through space. When you Stride, you gain a +3 item bonus to Armor Class against reactions triggered by your movement. Once per day, from any distance, Abrogail Thrune II can call on a provision in your Thrune contract as a single action, causing you to become [[Paralyzed]] for 1 hour or until Abrogail releases you, whichever comes first.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You recite a subclause of your contract regarding change in venue. You cast *[[Dimension Door]]*. The space you leave and the one you appear in are filled with the scent of brimstone, dealing 2d6 evil damage to creatures adjacent to both spaces.

```
