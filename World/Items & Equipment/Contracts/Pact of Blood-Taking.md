# Pact of Blood-Taking

**Item 5**

> You negotiate for might and viciousness.
**Benefit**: Your successful Strikes with slashing and piercing melee weapons deal 1 [[Persistent Bleed Damage]]. On a critical success, this persistent bleed damage is equal to half your level.
**Payment**: You regain half the normal number of Hit Points from resting (including Hit Points gained from long-term rest) and from any application of the [[Medicine]] skill.
**Hidden Condition**: The barbazu owns any weapons you find. No more often than once per month, the barbazu can demand a single weapon of its choice (often the best weapon in your possession). You are compelled to hand over the weapon immediately, without question.
**Termination Clause**: The contract guarantees that you will not “be slain by the barbazu or by barbazu action.” This wording is vague; if any barbazu kills you, or if you die from persistent bleed damage from any source, the contract is voided.
