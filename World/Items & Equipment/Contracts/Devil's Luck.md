# Devil's Luck

**Item 3**

> You've bargained with an imp, one of the least powerful devils, for a fragment of infernal luck.
**Benefit**: Once per day, you can roll a saving throw twice and use the higher result.
**Payment**: At the termination of your mortal life, your soul must serve the imp for 100 years.
**Hidden Condition**: The “termination of mortal life” clause is carefully worded to hasten your demise. You can't use the benefit against a [[Death]] effect, and if you roll a failure on a saving throw against a death effect, you get a critical failure instead.
**Termination Clause**: If you critically fail a saving throw against a death effect and do not die, the contract becomes unenforceable on its terms and is voided.
