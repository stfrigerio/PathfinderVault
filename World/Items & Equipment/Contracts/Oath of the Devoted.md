# Oath of the Devoted

**Item 9**

> You gain fire and mental resistance 5. When you die, you rise as an [[Undead]] creature with the [[Zombie]] trait on the next round; if you are a PC, you become an NPC under [[Walkena'S]] control. Your stats remain the same, except that your alignment changes to evil. If you reach 0 Hit Points as a zombie, you are destroyed and do not rise again.
