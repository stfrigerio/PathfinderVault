 Nanites play a vital role in the [[Android|android]] life cycle.
> A **nanite** is a type of microscopic, [[Technology|nanotechnological]] device capable of reproducing or achieving many effects of nature or [[Magic|magic]], from [[Disease|diseases]] to weapons to new forms of life. Many nanites are programmable, and some large groups of nanites are capable of a form of autonomous intelligence.
> Nanites are instrumental in every stage of an [[Android|androids]] life: nanites assemble androids in foundries, serve a function in android bodies similar to the blood of organic creatures, power androids' ability to achieve superhuman feats through nanite surges, and rejuvenate their bodies after their [[Soul|souls]] vacate them. Nanites are even part of androids that become [[Incorporeal undead|incorporeal undead]], becoming a sort of [[Phantom|phantom]] form of the living android's nanite system.
> Nanites can be repelled through [[Magnet|magnetic]] fields.

## Types

> Harmful nanites might cause [[Infestation|infestations]], such as fractal etch and soldier's peace. However, benign nanites that retain their original programming are capable of bringing great benefits. For instance, harvest nanites enhance crop production and eliminate pests and [[Disease|diseases]], medical nanites enter host bodies to exterminate invasive organisms, crafter nanites build objects and potentially shape flesh.

## Applications

> Due to being programmable microscopic machines, nanites can accomplish many tasks that are otherwise impossible without magic, such as mapping a creature's brain functions or automatically healing or repairing flesh and machine alike.

## On Golarion

> The nanites that remain from the [[Rain of Stars]] are often found in canisters, which are designed to work with many of the [[Androffa|Androffan]] devices scattered across [[Numeria]]. Such canisters have integrated power supplies that activate the nanites when used.


## On distant worlds

> Autonomous nanite swarms are among the many forms of life in Liavara's rings.
