 [[Harsk]] shows off some technological gear.
> **Technology** is defined on [[Golarion]] in one of three ways: fist, in the more specific sense, it is any non-[[Magic|magical]] device created through [[Science|scientific]] study that approaches or exceeds items created through [[Magic|magic]]. The incredible technological devices found in the nation of [[Numeria]] fall under this category. Secondly, more generally speaking, technology is any non-magical device that is used to assist in a task. This second definition covers items as simple as a lever to ones as complex as a [[Printing press|printing press]]. Thirdly, the term "technology" also covers items created using both magic and scientific ingenuity, such as complex [[Clockwork|clockworks]]. This article gives a brief overview of all three categories.



## History of general technological innovation

> The history of technological advancement on Golarion is a complex one. More than once, destructive, world-spanning events have wiped out hundreds or thousands of years of innovation and progress. The most famous example of this was [[Earthfall]], which destroyed the advanced [[Azlant|Azlanti]] and [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] civilizations, and ushered in the [[Age of Darkness]] that kept the major races back for thousands of years. Even once [[Human|humanity]] began to reemerge during the [[Age of Destiny]], technological advancement was checked by the availability of [[Magic|magic]]. After all, why invent a mechanical answer to a problem, when one can simply wish it into being by appealing to a [[Deity|deity]] or relying on [[Arcane magic|arcane magic]]? Technology, therefore, flourished best where magic was absent, such as in the [[Mana Wastes]] of [[Garund]]. It was here, in the city of [[Alkenstar]], that one of the greatest non-magical achievements of the past few hundred years was born: [[Firearm|firearms]].
> Another recent technological innovation is the [[Printing press|printing press]], which allows for the quick and inexpensive reproduction of pamphlets, letters, and books. Although printing presses are very expensive (especially movable type printing presses that allow the printer to rearrange letters and images, and thereby greatly speed-up the printing process), their cultural and political impact has been substantial. They have allowed for the quick dissemination of information, and have led to the democratization of ideas.


## Clockworks

***Main article: [[Clockwork]]***
> The technological understanding to build non-magical clockwork devices was first developed over 10,000 years ago in [[Azlant]], and later perfected in [[Thassilon]]. Even though Earthfall destroyed most examples of their work, a few constructs survived the apocalypse, leading to the rediscovery of the art thousands of years later. Because clockworks are so much more time-consuming to develop and create than more standard magical constructs, they remain somewhat of a curiosity of the rich.


## Numerian technology

> Numerian technology is alien in origin, and either comes directly from one of the [[Spaceship|spaceships]] that crashed in Numeria thousands of years ago during the [[Rain of Stars]], or has since been developed based on these items. The technology within them is so advanced as to be indistinguishable from magic to the common person. It is also quite dangerous and is prone to backfiring or even exploding, giving these items a well-deserved sinister reputation. Nearly all such items are under the strict control of the [[Technic League]] of Numeria, who hoard these items for their own profit and power.
> Examples of technological devices, powers, and forces found primarily in or having their origin in Numeria include:















> - access cards
> - [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligences]]
> - [[Battery|batteries]] and other means of electrical storage and transmission
> - [[Beam weapon|beam weapons]]
> - [[Camera|cameras]]
> - chemicals
> - computers
> - cybertechnology
> - [[Electronic device|electronic devices]]
> - [[Explosive|explosives]]


> - [[Firearm|firearms]]
> - glitches
> - holograms
> - [[Laser|lasers]]
> - [[Nanite|nanite]] technology
> - pharmaceuticals
> - [[Power supply|power supplies]]
> - [[Radiation|radiation]]
> - [[Robot|robots]] and other technological [[Construct|constructs]]
> - [[Spaceship|spaceships]]





> [[Technologist|Technologists]] have unique talents for finding and using technology, while [[Technic League]] [[Technomancer|technomancers]] try to preserve their stranglehold on what technological secrets have already been unlocked. Many technological devices are [[Timeworn|timeworn]] from their centuries on Golarion.


### Magic and Numerian technology

> Certain [[Spell|spells]] are capable of specifically targeting technological devices and forces:















> - *antitech field*
> - *destroy robot*
> - *detect radiation*
> - *discharge*
> - *infuse robot*
> - *irradiate*
> - *magic circle against technology*


> - *make whole, greater*
> - *memory of function*
> - *protection from technology*
> - *rebuke technology*
> - *recharge*
> - *remove radioactivity*
> - *technomancy*





> [[Iron priest|Iron priests]] are [[Cleric|clerics]], often of [[Brigh]], [[Nethys]], [[Gorum]], or [[Haagenti]], who can manipulate unliving constructs through [[Divine magic|divine magic]] in a similar manner as other clerics can turn [[Undead|undead]]. Technomancers can apply technology to amplify magic, and vice versa.


### Science and Numerian technology

> Sub-branches of Numerian technology include:

> - Biotechnology
> - Robotics

### Numerian technological items

> Technological devices share much in common with [[Magic item|magic items]]: both require extensive training, time, money, materials, and tools to create. However, technological items forgo spells for high-tech effects and capabilities.
> Technological items must be created in specialized [[Laboratory|laboratories]], which require power.


#### Numerian weapons and armor

> Technological [[Weapon|weapons]] have unique features and requirements. For instance, many require power to function.
> Technological [[Firearm|firearms]] and ranged weapons, such as [[Beam weapon|beam weapons]], can have different fire modes, allowing even relatively unskilled wielders to rapidly fire single shots or quick bursts. They can also feature unusual attacks, such as [[Laser|lasers]] that burn through barriers or infectious mind-rending [[Nanite|nanites]].
> [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor]] of this nature can protect against [[Element|elemental]] forces, including the vacuum of the [[Void]].


#### Hybrid items

> Items can be designed to combine technology and magic, or can be enchanted after creation with magical abilities.

#### Color coding

> Numerian technological items can be categorized in terms of their relative strength via certain colors associated with various [[Skymetal|skymetals]], though most items do not contain the skymetals associated with their color. There are nine known "colors" of technology, listed from weakest to most powerful:

> - **Brown**, representing base non-skymetal ores and the weakest technological items
> - **Black** ([[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]])
> - **White** ([[Siccatite|siccatite]])
> - **Gray** ([[Inubrix|inubrix]])
> - **Green** ([[Noqual|noqual]])
> - **Red** ([[Djezet 1|djezet]])
> - **Blue** ([[Abysium|abysium]])
> - **Orange** ([[Horacalcum|horacalcum]])
> - **Prismatic**, representing all skymetals and the most powerful technological items

#### Degradation over time

***Main article: [[Timeworn]]***
> Technological items can lose their functionality over time due to neglect and damage. Such items might not be rechargeable, and might require constant maintenance simply to maintain their basic functionality.


#### Charging devices

***Main article: [[Power supply]]***
> Technology requires power, usually in the form of electricity, and such power is hard to come by on Golarion. [[Battery|Batteries]] and [[Generator|generators]] can provide power, as can certain spells and abilities.


#### Radiation

***Main article: [[Radiation]]***
> Radiation is a mysterious [[Poisonous|poisonous]] aura of a technological nature that permeates many of [[Numeria|Numerias]] alien ruins.
