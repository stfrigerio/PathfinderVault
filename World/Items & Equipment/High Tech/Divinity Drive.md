## History

> The Divinity Drive, an exceptionally dense 5-foot sphere of blue light weighing 2,500 pounds, is named after the god-like magnitude of its power. Its practically infinite energy and reality-ripping capabilities provided the *Divinity* with unique capabilities for its cosmos-spanning mission.
> After the *Divinity* crashed into [[Numeria]], [[Unity]]—one of the ship's onboard [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligences]]—began repairing and modifying the drive toward its own purposes in the ship's ruins.
