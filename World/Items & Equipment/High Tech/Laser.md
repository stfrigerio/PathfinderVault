> A **laser** is a tightly focused beam of light. Sufficiently powerful lasers can burn through barriers, including extremely hard objects, and can bypass [[Magic|magical]] barriers and [[Force field|force fields]] altogether to burn whatever they strike. Lasers are a product of [[Technology|technology]] and are used in beam weapons and tools alike.


## As weapons

> The most powerful lasers can easily bore holes through any creature or object their beams encounter, while the weakest lasers still provide useful functions for aiming ranged weapons. However, lasers have no effect on objects and creatures bearing [[Magic|magical]] invisibility effects, and their beams can be diffused by clouds, fog, and smoke.
