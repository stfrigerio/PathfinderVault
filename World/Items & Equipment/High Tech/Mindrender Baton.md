# Mindrender Baton

**Item 15**

> This short, green, metal baton uses potent transmissions along brainwave frequencies to control the minds of nearby creatures. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.A mindrender baton's power is provided via a battery, but King Irovetti has used his supply of them over the years. Whether or not you want to allow the PCs to discover replacement batteries to recharge this device is left to you to decide, but certainly batteries are not available in markets outside of Numeria itself—and even there, their availability isn't guaranteed. When this campaign begins, the mindrender baton Irovetti carries is fully powered and has 10 charges available. Charges are expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below for each activation's “Charges” entry.The mindrender baton can be used as a [[Club]].
