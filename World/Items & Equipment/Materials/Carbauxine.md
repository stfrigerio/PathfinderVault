> **Carbauxine** is a colorless and odorless gas that is a byproduct of heavy carbon deposits and can be found in small pockets throughout the [[Darklands]], particularly in [[Sekamina]] and [[Orv]]. It also can appear naturally on the surface in areas with strong volcanic activity. It heavier than air and highly flammable, and will violently combust if exposed to an open flame. The [[Dwarf|dwarves]] long-ago learned how to harvest carbauxine gas safely, using it to create exceedingly hot flames that could be used for smelting [[World/Mithral|mithral]] or even [[Skymetal|skymetals]].



## Known Locations of Carbauxine


### Riddleport

> The best-known natural deposit of carbauxine gas is actually just below the surface of the Varisan city of [[Riddleport]]. There, the dwarves of the [[Gas Forges]] harvest the gas, using it for their smelting and forging. The deposit was discovered in the late 45th century AR and dwarves from nearby [[Janderhoff]] quickly moved in to capitalize on it.


### Dalaston

> Near the town of [[Dalaston]] in [[Taldor|Taldors]] southern [[World's Edge Mountains|Worlds Edge Mountains]] lies a volcano known as Blackpeak. Although it has not erupted in centuries, vents of carbauxine gas can occasionally be found nearby, burning above ground.
