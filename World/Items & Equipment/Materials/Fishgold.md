> **Fishgold** is the local name for a unique red-coloured [[Gold|gold]] found only in the depths of [[Lake Encarthan]]. Fishgold is identical to normal yellow gold in every way apart from its unusual hue. It maybe crafted into items of value, such as jewellery, and fishgold items seem to fetch the same price as items made from normal gold. Though not widely known, many such items are made by [[Skum|skum]] tribes that live in Lake Encarthan.
