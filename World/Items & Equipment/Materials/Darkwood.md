> **Darkwood** is a species of rare magical hardwood which is exceptionally light, weighing generally half as much as woods of the same hardness.



## Ecology

> Darkwood thrives in old growth forests in south-central [[Avistan]], especially the [[Darkmoon Vale]] region of northern [[Andoran]]. The Forest Elder in the center of [[Darkmoon Wood]] is generally considered to be the oldest specimen of the species in Andoran, and perhaps the oldest in the whole continent. The trees can also be found throughout the world from the wilds of the [[Screaming Jungle]] to the [[Druma|Druman]] city of [[Macridi]].


## Economy

> The monopolistic [[Lumber Consortium]] has made a fortune off the increasingly rare darkwood harvests coming from the region, and they continue to work their employees to the bone in order to bring in ever more profits from the dwindling resource. The Consortium harvests approximately 350,000 board feet of darkwood annually (which constitutes roughly 5% of its total logging operation) from its cut-yards in Darkmoon Wood.


## Uses

> Darkwood harvested by the Lumber Consortium is used almost exclusively in the shipyards of [[Almas]] and [[Augustana]], though it can be substituted for other hardwood in other applications as well, and is frequently used to make light weapons and shields. Darkwood leaves can be fermented into a potent alcoholic beverage and the [[Sitting Duck]] tavern in [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] has made a name for itself by serving this regional brew.


### Alchemical Reagent

> The bark of the darkwood tree is useful in numerous [[Alchemy|alchemical]] applications as an [[Alchemical reagent|alchemical reagent]], especially those that require a light but strong foundation. As an alchemical power component it is associated with boosting the effectiveness of [[Magic/Conjuration|conjuration]] [[Spell|spells]]. A dose of darkwood costs 2 gold pieces.

**Item 0+**

> Darkwood is a very lightweight wood found primarily in old-growth forests in south-central Avistan; it is dark as ebony but has a slight purple tint. A darkwood item’s Bulk is reduced by 1 (or to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on an item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item made of darkwood is based on the item’s normal Bulk, not its reduced Bulk for being made of darkwood, but reduce the Bulk before making any further Bulk adjustments for the size of the item.
