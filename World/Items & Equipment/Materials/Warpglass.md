# Warpglass

**Item 0+**

> This bizarre substance is fashioned from the raw, chaotic quintessence of the Maelstrom. It can be fashioned into weapons and items, but is too unstable to make into useful armor or shields.Raw warpglass is an opalescent glassy material with surprising strength. When worked, it changes its appearance—though not its properties—to appear as random striations of other metals and types of stone.
