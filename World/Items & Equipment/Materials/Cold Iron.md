[[Demon|Demons]] and many [[Fey|fey]] creatures are particularly [[Anathema|vulnerable]] to it, as are certain other [[Magic|magical]] creatures such as [[Jackalwere|jackalweres]]. [[Weapon|Weapons]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] made of cold iron generally cost much more than the normal price, and are more complicated (and costly) to enchant.
