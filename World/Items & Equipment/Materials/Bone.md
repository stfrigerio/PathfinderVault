# Bone

**Item 0+**

> A durable material when properly treated, bone can replace wood and metal when creating armor, shields, and weapons. The statistics for bone are applicable to a variety of other sturdy animal-based products, such as chitin, horn, ivory, coral, and shell, which can also be classified as bone for the purposes of determining item statistics. Bone elements from certain beasts, like the horn of a [[Unicorn]] or the spikes of a [[Manticore]], may even yield magical properties when worked by a skilled crafter.
