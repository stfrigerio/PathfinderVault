> **Djezet**, sometimes called **quickiron**, is the least understood [[Skymetal|skymetal]], largely due to its unusual form: it is a liquid at all temperatures. Djezet grows red when targeted by magic, even when alloyed with other [[Metal|metals]], so djezet is often nicknamed "**tiger iron**".
> Djezet fell from the skies onto Golarion even before [[Earthfall]], landing in a dense forest within [[Arcadia]].


## Uses of djezet

> The rust-red substance is a sought-after spellcasting component, as it amplifies [[Magic|magical]] power above and beyond natural spellcasting abilities. It is associated with [[Magic/Enchantment|enchantment]] magic, love, and lust Djezet also has [[Radiation|radiation]]-deflecting properties. Because of its naturally liquid state, djezet is rarely used in making weapons and armor, although in ancient [[Thassilon]] it was rumored that certain powerful spellcasters (including [[Xin]] himself) had developed djezet alloys.
> The [[Red Terror]], a [[Robot|robot]] in the [[Red Redoubt of Karamoss]], is rumored to be crafted of **djezeteel**, an alloy of steel and djezet.
