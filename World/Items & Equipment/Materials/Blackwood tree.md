> **Blackwood trees** provide the hardest but also lightest wood on [[Golarion]]. The last dominion of blackwood trees is the [[Verduran Forest]] which is protected by the druids of [[Wildwood Lodge]].
> Blackwood is ideal for shipbuilding, but is also derived for tar. [[Taldor]] is renowned for its blackwood-derived tar, a substance typically used to waterproof ships and wood roofs. The blackwood tar has a pleasant, sweet odor and the tar factories of the Imperial Shipyards in [[Cassomir]] often smell eerily like candy.
