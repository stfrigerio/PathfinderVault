# Violet Ray

**Item 12**

> One of the many wondrous devices brought into the world by Stasian technology is the seemingly miraculous violet ray. Physicians claim it anything from headaches to heartburn, or nausea to deafness, all with an easy and painless treatment. The device is a glass vacuum with an insulated handle connected to a small Stasian coil. When powered, the glass tube fills with purple light and becomes warm to the touch. Pressing the tube to one's body is said to increase blood flow, eliminate toxins, and many other beneficial effects. A violet ray functions as a set of [[Healer'S Tools]] and provides a +2 item bonus to [[Medicine]] checks to [[Administer First Aid]], [[Treat Disease]], [[Treat Poison]], or [[Treat Wounds]].

Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You apply the violet ray to an adjacent creature and attempt to counteract the [[Blinded]], [[Clumsy]], [[Confused]], [[Deafened]], [[Drained]], [[Enfeebled]], [[Sickened]], or [[Stupefied]] condition with a [[Counteract]] level of 6 and a counteract modifier of +22, using the source of the condition to determine the condition's counteract level and DC. If the condition was caused by an ongoing effect and you don't remove that effect, the condition returns after 1 minute. Each use of this ability can only counteract a single condition.
