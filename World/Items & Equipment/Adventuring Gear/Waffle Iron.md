The plates of this waffle iron are made of [[Standard-Grade Mithral]] rather than iron and might bear an imprint on the plates. As with other mithral cookware, food rarely sticks to a mithral waffle iron. As it's made of mithral, this is an uncommon item.

## Waffle Iron (High-Grade Mithral)

**Item 16**

Uncommon

**Price**: 6,005 gp
**Bulk**: 1

Truly fit for emperors and demigods, this waffle iron is made of high-grade mithral. Although most metallurgists are certain that the much more affordable standard-grade mithral waffle iron maintains mithral's full non-stick properties, the super elite insist that only waffles made from high-grade mithral waffle irons conform to the most perfect shape and texture. Nadian has one high-grade mithral waffle iron for sale emblazoned with an archaic symbol associated with [[Milani]] from before she became a deity, supposedly used to make Milani herself waffles during her mortal life. As it's made of mithral, this is an uncommon item.
