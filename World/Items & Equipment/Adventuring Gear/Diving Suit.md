# Diving Suit

**Item 3**

> Diving suits are bulky, waterproofed leather outfits with copper helmets, worn by divers and underwater salvagers. The suit grants a +1 item bonus to [[Swim]] checks made underwater, and the helmet features tubes for connecting *[[Bottled Air]]*. When connected to a diving suit, bottled air doesn't need to be held and can be used to breathe as a free action. If you wear armor over a diving suit, you become [[Clumsy 1]] until you remove the diving suit.
