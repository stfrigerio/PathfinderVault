# Thieves' Tools

**Item 0+**

> You need thieves' tools to [[Pick Locks]] or [[Disable Devices]] (of some types) using the [[Thievery]] skill. If your thieves' tools are broken, you can repair them by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks appropriate to your tools; this doesn't require using the [[Repair]] action. If you wear your thieves' tools, you can draw and replace them as part of the action that uses them.

You can use a set of tools with 1 hand if you're [[Wearing Them]] or 2 if you're holding them.
