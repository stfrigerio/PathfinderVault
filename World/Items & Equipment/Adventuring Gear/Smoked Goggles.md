# Smoked Goggles

**Item 3**

> These goggles use lenses made out of smoked glass to protect against creatures with gaze attacks. While wearing smoked goggles, you're always considered to be [[Averting Your Gaze]], but all creatures have [[Concealment]] from you. The fact that the goggles conceal creatures is part of what grants the wearer the item's benefits. If you have a way to negate the concealment from the smoked goggles, you no longer gain the benefit, either.
