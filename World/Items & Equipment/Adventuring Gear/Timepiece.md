# Timepiece

**Item 1+**

> Clockwork timepieces come in a variety of sizes and aesthetic styles, but they're all designed to display the accurate time of day down to the second.

Clockwork timepieces have a 24-hour activation cycle, after which they must wound in a process that takes 1 minute to complete.

## Timepiece (Desktop Clock)

**Item 1**

**Price**: 10 gp
**Bulk**: 3

Desktop clocks have been designed to be small enough to only take up a quarter of a typical writing desk's surface area, but they're still too bulky and heavy to be lugged around casually.

## Timepiece (Grand Clock)

**Item 3**

**Price**: 50 gp
**Bulk**: 16

These towering, ten-foot-tall clocks have been painstakingly handcrafted by skilled artisans and feature loud chimes that can be heard hourly throughout a manor. Owners of grand clocks usually tend to display them prominently in a study, lounge area, or foyer.
