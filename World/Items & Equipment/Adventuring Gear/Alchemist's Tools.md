# Alchemist's Tools

**Item 0**

> This mobile collection of vials and chemicals can be used for simple alchemical tasks. If you wear your alchemist's tools, you can draw and replace them as part of the action that uses them.

You can use a set of tools with 1 hand if you're [[Wearing Them]] or 2 if you're holding them.
