# Swim Fins

**Item 0**

> These flippers attach to your feet like tight shoes—donning or removing them requires three Interact actions. While worn, you gain a +5-foot item bonus to the distance you move when rolling Athletics to Swim, not when using a swim Speed, and you take a –10-foot item penalty to your Speed.
