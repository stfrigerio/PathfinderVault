A tiny crank protrudes from the side of this carriage. If the crank is wound and the carriage is released on the ground, the carriage propels in a straight line at a Speed of 10 feet. Each Interact action spent winding the crank propels the carriage for 1 round. A windup toy carriage can be wound for a maximum of 9 actions total, at which point it's too tight to wind further.
