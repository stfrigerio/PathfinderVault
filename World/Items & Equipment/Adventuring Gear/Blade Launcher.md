# Blade Launcher

**Item 1**

> A blade launcher has a bow-like assembly mounted on a handled frame. The frame can be configured to fire either a [[Dagger]], [[Dart]], [[Shuriken]], or [[Starknife]]. Configuring a blade launcher requires three Interact actions. Once properly configured, loading an appropriate [[Thrown]] weapon into a blade launcher requires a single Interact action. A blade launcher can't fire weapons for which it's not currently configured. A weapon fired with a blade launcher loses the [[Agile]], [[Monk]], [[Thrown]], and [[Versatile]] traits, if it has them, and has a range increment of 40 feet. Due to losing the thrown weapon trait, *[[Returning]]* and most other effects that allow a weapon to return don't function; even if a launched weapon did return, you'd still need to load it into the blade launcher with an Interact action to fire the blade launcher again.
