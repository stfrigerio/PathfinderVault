# Pocket Watch

**Item 2**

> This timepiece is a marvel of clockwork and miniaturization; its gears, arbor, and mainspring are immaculately crafted and tuned to maximize precision and reduce time loss. This pocket watch has the properties of a [[Clockwork Dial]], except it has a maximum duration of 24 hours and is available to characters from Alkenstar.
