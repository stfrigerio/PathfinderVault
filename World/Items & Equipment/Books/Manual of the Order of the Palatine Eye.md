The ***Manual of the Order of the Palatine Eye*** is one of the main works of the secretive [[Ustalav]] organization called the [[Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye]]. The deep purple book is adorned with the symbol of the Order: a scarab beetle, made of brass, with a single eye image on its back. The covers of the book are lined in polished steel and the book may be locked shut using a key with a triangular shaft. Its contents include discussions of mathematics and the arcane with descriptions of ancient ceremonies, however, the text is written in encoded [[Human languages of Golarion|Varisian]] to make it very difficult to read.
