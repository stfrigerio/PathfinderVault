> The **Korvosa City Charter** is a legal document for the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city-state of [[Korvosa]] that lists its "unbreakable laws", which can only be modified by a complicated amendment process and which no ruler of the city can arbitrarily change.



## History

> The Korvosa City Charter was first sanctioned in [[4406 AR]] by [[Halleck IV|Emperor Halleck IV]] of [[Cheliax]]. It has since been amended 247 times, and the amendments are considered as binding as the original charter itself.


## Notable amendments

> One of the City Charter's best known amendments forbids merchants, laborers, or tradesmen to form any kind of guild. Its main goal is to prevent price fixing and maintain control over the city's labor force.


## Other uses

> The [[Arbiters Korvosa|Arbiters of Korvosa]], through their power of legislative oversight, have the ability to compare any edicts passed by the [[Monarchy Korvosa|citys monarch]] against the City Charter. If at least five of the seven arbiters agree that the new edict does not contradict anything in the Charter, it becomes law, otherwise it is sent back to the monarch for further review.
