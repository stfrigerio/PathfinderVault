Shelyn's Holy Symbol
> ***Melodies of Inner Beauty*** is the holy text of the church of [[Shelyn]]. It contains the history of the goddess, including her family, though drawing a veil over the nastier elements about [[Dou-Bral]] and [[Zon-Kuthon]], her half-brother. It tells stories about Shelyn and discusses her church's dogma. [[Music]] is used throughout as many of the tales are set as songs and hymns. Other [[Art|artistic]] ways of interpreting the words are also utilized, such as dance and poetry.
