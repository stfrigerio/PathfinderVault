> The ***Calosian Manuscript*** was written by an [[Osirion|Osirian]] [[Osirionologist]] centuries after the end of the [[Second Age of Osirion]]. The much-debated manuscript describes interactions with creatures from [[Aucturn]]. According to it, floating creatures referred to only as "the Emissaries" gave the [[Four Pharaohs of Ascension]] eleven gifts. It is clear that the three of the gifts were the Pact Stone, the Aqualinth of Tumen, and the reality-altering [[Mathematics|mathematical]] concept known as the Final Theorem. Scholars suspect that among the other gifts mentioned are the [[Androsphinx of Zukebri]] and an unknown device at [[Shotep-Kara]] which was said to create the magical space-folding sea lanes.
