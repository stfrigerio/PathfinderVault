 Holy symbol of Brigh
> [[Brigh|Brighs]] holy text is ***Logic of Design***, an essay on invention, experimentation, documentation, and discovery that also functions as a textbook on the [[Science|scientific]] fields of metallurgy, electricity, physics, and stonemasonry. It is more informational than dogmatic, and reinforces the tenets of scientific methodology and shared knowledge that underpin her worship; indeed it can read like a university textbook authored by several contributors.
