> ***Draconic Apsu*** is a four-thousand-line epic recounting the creation of the true [[Dragon|dragon]] races as recorded in the fourth generation by the [[Gold dragon|gold dragon]] sage [[Gunnarrex]].  Most famous are the first nine lines of the epic, portions of which appear throughout draconic literature and among the most legendary of draconic locales. 

*I shall then be [[Apsu]],  for I am the first.  I am the primeval,  who was of [[Heaven]]  and of [[Material Plane|Material]]  before they had names,  for I created them with Chaos.  I then shall go  *
*and I shall end Death.*

The first two lines are by far the most widely-found excerpt from this passage, carved into the very faces of the [[Obelisks of Fate]] and the Obelisks of Destiny.  The final line, "and I shall end death," appears throughout Dragonfall and is frequently used as a battle cry by [[Metallic dragon|metallic dragons]] when they enter combat with their [[Chromatic dragon|chromatic]] kin.
