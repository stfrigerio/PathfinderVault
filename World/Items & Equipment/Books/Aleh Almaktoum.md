> The ***Aleh Almaktoum*** (meaning ***Book of the Dead*** in [[Ancient Osiriani]]) is a series of 20 to 24 papyrus [[Scroll|scrolls]] considered to be the definitive [[Osirion|Osirian]] treatise and [[Spellbook|spellbook]] on [[Necromancy|necromancy]], primarily on [[Arcane magic|arcane]] matters. While ignorant people consider [[Geb (person)|Geb]] to be its author, according to credible [[Osirionology|Osirionologists]], the *Aleh Almaktoum* far predated his birth, and he only collected it.

> - How to combat [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Undead|undead]] and prevent their creation, including a list of conditions for the natural emergence of undead and symptoms of related [[Diseases of Golarion|diseases]]
> - How to control or influence undead, and its moral and religious implications
> - How to create undead (this section is believed to have been written by Geb much later than the previous ones, and is usually omitted from non-[[Evil|evil]] owners' copies)
