It undertakes missions on the [[Arcadian Ocean]].

> The ship is currently under the command of the [[Half-elf|half-elven]] shipwright, [[Eras the Needle]].


## History

> The *Pixie* began as the ***Golden Barb***, a [[Carrack|carrack]] built in the shipyards of [[Ostenso]], [[Cheliax]], in [[4673 AR]]. The Pathfinder Society hired it in [[4674 AR]] as part of the efforts to reopen the the [[Pathfinder lodge]] of [[Delvehaven]], but after the lodge was shuttered by Cheliax in [[4676 AR]], the Society claimed it as their own. It was renamed the *Grinning Pixie* in [[4679 AR]], designated a Pathfinder lodge, and placed under the command of [[Venture-Captain]] Tal Xtimbuo.
