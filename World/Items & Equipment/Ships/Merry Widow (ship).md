> The **Merry Widow** is a ship that was scuttled off the southern coast of [[Slitherfish Island]] to the northeast of [[Mediogalti]]. It is now half beneath the waves; its water-filled lower decks are home to great numbers of sharks and [[Devilfish|devilfish]].
> The wreck is currently being used as a temple to the pirate-goddess [[Besmara]], established by a sect known as the [[Merry Widows]]. This splinter group is made up of women who have lost their husbands at sea. It is said that some Mediogalti women donate unwanted males to the ship-temple as a sacrifice to the goddess.
