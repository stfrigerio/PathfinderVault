*This article covers the [[Spaceship|spaceship]] that crashed into [[Numeria]] during the [[Rain of Stars]]. For the concept of divine power, see [[Deity|deity]] and [[Divine magic|divine magic]].*
> The ***Divinity*** was a massive [[Spaceship|spaceship]] from the [[Planet|planet]] [[Androffa]], charged with spreading [[Technology|technology]] and advanced civilization. The *Divinity* and the train of [[Ship|ships]] it supported crashed on [[Golarion]] in [[-4363 AR]] after a battle with the [[Dominion of the Black]], an event known to Golarians as the [[Rain of Stars]].


## Construction

> The *Divinity* was made from [[Glaucite|glaucite]]. It was outfitted with numerous [[Camera|cameras]] and laser turrets spread across the decks; artificial [[Gravity|gravity]] generators; as well as the [[Wormhole|wormhole]]-generating [[Divinity Drive]], which required a wide surface area relative to its mass, leading to a large part of the ship being inaccessible structural voids. The *Divinity* was divided into numerous decks, connected via lifts and monorails:

Android crÃ¨che
Most of the *Divinity'*s [[Android|androids]] were manufactured here, and became [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Undead|undead]] after the crash, led by a creature whose body consists of three merged androids.
Astrogation deck
A small deck, where navigators charted the [[Star|stars]] and performed the calculations necessary to open wormholes.
Cargo hold
A heavily damaged deck, where the gravity pumps no longer function, and which has been taken over by powerful [[Vegepygmy|vegepygmies]] led by [[Fungus queen|fungus queens]].
Command deck
Home to the commanders, who directed the *Divinity'*s navigation and functions.
Crew quarters
Home to numerous escaped aliens who subsist on the still-functioning food replicators.
Divinity Core
The Divinity Drive and other [[Power supply|power supplies]] were once housed here, but during the crash, the veil between [[Plane|planes]] weakened, trapping three groups of [[Outsider|outsiders]] ([[Div|divs]], [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]], and [[Protean|proteans]]) in a state of cold war.
![[Habitat_ship.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A habitat module from the spaceship *Divinity*.
Habitats
The *Divinity* had four habitat pods and 14 habitat domes, each serving a different purpose: providing air, food and water, recreation, or serving as zoos and gardens for alien life. During the crash, most of the domes detached, and the central pods were destroyed. Habitat Pod 1 was originally filled with Androffan jungles, but was damaged by the Dominion; after that, the crew harvested new specimens from [[Castrovel]], including an entire [[Lashunta|lashunta]] village, and put them into stasisâ€”one of their last acts before the crash, which somehow did not damage the pod, before the [[Technic League]] agent Geetan Prosser deactivated the stasis. Habitat Pod 4 is an icy waste, filled with [[Boreal creature|boreal creatures]].
Medical bay
Home to the undead crew who retreated here just before the crash.
Primary engineering deck
A multi-level deck where all [[Engineering|engineering]] was handled. Due to its altitude post-crash, it was colonised by [[Spine dragon|spine dragons]] and their [[Gargoyle|gargoyle]] servants.
Quarantine
Prison of the first victims of the Dominion's weaponry.
Recreation deck
A deck where the crew could relax as though back home on Androffa.
Science labs
Numerous decks were dedicated to [[Science|sciences]], including anthropology (currently home to undead), biology (filled with [[Evil|evil]] [[Fungi|fungi]]), physics (infested by [[Trap|traps]] and haywire [[Robot|robots]]), and robotics (ruled by a rogue Technic League member thought dead).
Secondary engineering deck
A garage, repair facility, and secondary power source, home to the only shuttle that remains intact after the crash.
Security decks
The *Divinity* maintained numerous security decks, the largest of which was called the security sector. The security sector served to keep law and order across the ship, and was also the hub of the *Divinity'*s monorail network. Its control centre, which came with its own life support, power supply, and food, can last months.
Stasis lab
A high-security jail where Dominion prisoners were (and still are) kept.
> The *Divinity* spearheaded a caravan of several other ships. As it crashed, these other ships separated with some attempting to land intact, resulting in the wide spread of wreckage across Numeria. These ships included:

> - A detached habitat dome designed to carry specimens of other species
> - The *Aurora*, an android foundry and genetics [[Laboratory|laboratory]] module
> - The *Chrysalis*, a recycling module and cargo bay
> - The *[[Destiny]]*, a habitat ship that contained [[Kasath|Kasathan]] fauna which crashed on the site of what is now the town of [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Torch]]
> - The *Dusklight*, an older derelict spaceship of unknown origin being transported by the *Divinity*; pieces of this ship are also scattered across Numeria
> - An intact shuttle craft inside a sinkhole in the [[Sellen Hills]]

## History

> The *Divinity* was launched from Androffa around nine millennia ago, on a mission to spread culture and civilisation to other planets that was scheduled to last 25 years. The *Divinity'*s crew, though still [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Human|human]], viewed themselves as [[Deity|gods]], and sought to foster an empire with their mission. During the first several years of the mission, the crew made contact with dozens of societies and brought some individuals aboard the ship.
> Eventually, out of hubris, the crew drove the *Divinity* into a region of space controlled by the Dominion of the Black, which crippled the ship. Although the *Divinity* was able to open a wormhole to escape into an uncharted [[Solar system|solar system]], the Dominion's [[Weapon|weapons]], which spread [[Insanity|insanity]] among the crew and [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligences]] alike, had done their work: soon enough, the crew descended into madness and started fighting each other as well as the increasingly unstable [[Unity|central AI]]. In the end, the still-sane crew decided to scuttle the *Divinity* on Golarion, the closest habitable world, where they could retreat before the AI could seize the life support systems.
> However, the crash was more devastating than the crew expected. In [[-4363 AR]], the *Divinity* broke apart in Golarion's atmosphere, and nearly all of the crew died. The biggest piece crashed mostly intact in northern Numeria, becoming known as [[Silver Mount]], while most others landed in the [[Felldales]]. Most of the crash sites were eventually buried by the local [[Kellid|Kellids]], who viewed them with fear after a warlord accidentally triggered an explosion, although Silver Mount proved too big to bury.
