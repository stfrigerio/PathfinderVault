> The [[Ship|frigate]] ***Black Dragon*** is captained by [[Houkna Bewul]], the brutal master of the town of [[Dragonsthrall]] on [[Dahak's Horn|Dahaks Horn]] island in the [[Shackles]]. Her ship is one of the few seaworthy vessels in the [[Cult of Dahak]]'s seedy fleet, which mostly consists of barely floating tubs, ramshackle rafts, and rickety launches.
