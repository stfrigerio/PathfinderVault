> The legendary [[Pirate|pirate]] [[Ship|galleon]] ***Thief of Paradise*** was captained by [[Redburnt Hurdaz]]. It is known that shortly before Hurdaz's mysterious disappearance, she had captured a fat [[Aspis Consortium]]'s convoy transporting a full year's tribute from a rich [[Garund|Garundi]] port. Rumor has it her treasure is hidden in the [[Lake Vene]] on the [[Shark Island]].
