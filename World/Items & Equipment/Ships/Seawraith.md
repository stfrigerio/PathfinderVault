> The ***Seawraith*** is the goddess [[Besmara|Besmaras]] legendary [[Pirate|pirate]] [[Ship|ship]], which plows the seas of the [[Maelstrom]]. It seems to vary in size and type, depending on the culture and background of those who have seen it. To some it appears like a massive war galleon bristling with weapons, to others a sleek and fast longship or even a dhow. It is also said to trail a small armada of drags floating behind it, which crawl with fierce immortal pirates. Whatever form the ship takes, it has a terror-inducing reputation stemming from its many raids on places such as [[Heaven]], [[Elysium]], [[Hell]], and [[Axis]].
> It is said that Besmara herself will take especially cunning or brave pirates aboard the vessel to serve her in her multidimensional raids.
