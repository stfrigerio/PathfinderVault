> ***Naiegoul*** is the black [[Ship|galleon]] of the vicious [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] [[Raugsmauda]]. Soon after the [[Eye of Abendego]] formed in the north, Raugsmauda emerged from the [[Sulphur|sulfuric fumes]] of her lair on the island of [[Raugsmauda's Reach|Raugsmaudas Reach]] and began to sail the archipelago as captain of the *Naiegoul* one night each month. On these nights, her dreadful galleon can appear anywhere across the [[Shackles]] to capture lone vessels with unholy ease. No ship is more feared in the [[Star|starlit]] night than *Naiegoul* whose black flag bears the words *Geghalle Omutapuraii*, or "Hope Vanishes" written in the [[Nonhuman languages of GolarionCyclops|Ghol-Gan language]] not spoken in millennia. The berth of *Naiegoul* is at the long wharf in front of [[Raugsmauda's Tower|Raugsmaudas Tower]]. The wood from which the Naiegoul is built is as black as a starless night and radiates powerful [[Necromancy|necromantic]] energy. Small [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|batlike]] [[Humanoid|humanoid]] creatures move hurriedly through its tattered sails, and its crew consists of [[Draugr|draugr]], [[Wight|wights]], and [[Lacedon|lacedons]]. Raugsmauda's first mate is the [[Graveknight|graveknight]] [[Chouzbec]] assisted by [[Pyrada Naulk]], a priest of [[Lamashtu]]. Raugsmauda herself always helms the *Naiegoul*.
