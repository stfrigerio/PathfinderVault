> The ***Mother o' Seasons*** was the [[Ship|barkentine]] of the infamous buccaneer Knotbeard. Nearly 200 years ago, Knotbeard, trapped in a narrow cove of an island that would become known as [[Firegrass Isle]], set his ship on fire. The rampant inferno destroyed *Mother o' Seasons* and Knotbeard's crew but also the four warships of the [[Chelish Navy]] which had trapped them. The fire spread to the dry grass that covered the rocky island, consuming every living thing upon it. Of the 17 [[Cheliax|Chelish]] sailors who survived the fire, only four managed to stay alive on the island long enough to be recovered by a passing ship a week and a half later.
