> ***Semudarogah*** (or *Sea Plague* in [[Vudrani language|Vudrani]]) is a massive [[Ship|galleon]] captained by the cruel mandrill-headed [[Rakshasa|rakshasa]] [[Bedu Hanji]] who rules the [[Rampore Isles]] in the [[Shackles]]. Two months out of the year Hanji and a large part of Rampore's fleet sail north around the [[Eye of Abendego]], pillaging merchant vessels as far away as [[Varisia]]. They also raid the coastlines to secure fresh [[Humanoid|humanoid]] cargo for Hanji's thriving [[Slavery|slave-training]] camps.
