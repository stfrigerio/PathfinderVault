> The [[Pirate Pact]] vessel *Hanspur's Luck* was found wrecked on the [[Sellen River]] in [[4709 AR]]. The vessel had earlier been dispatched on a rescue mission by Lady Riverbane, but had not been heard of in some time. When found the ship was partially submerged, and had clearly been overrun by giant spiders of the [[Echo Wood]].
