> ***Easy Virtue*** is one of the heaviest ships in [[Riddleport]]. Hideous carvings of writhing sea serpents decorate its gunwales. The [[Ship|brig]] is captained by Skel Grumach who reports directly to Overlord [[Gaston Cromarcky]]. All [[Pirate|pirates]] know that Captain Grumach is the overlord's unofficial representative in the gulf. *Easy Virtue* targets not only merchant ships flying under a foreign flag but also pirate ships that attack ships flying Riddleport's colors.
