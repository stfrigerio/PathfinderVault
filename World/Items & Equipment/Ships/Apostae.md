> **Apostae, the Messenger**, is the tenth celestial body from [[Golarion]]'s [[Sun|sun]]. It is distinguished by its unique, non-elliptical orbit practically perpendicular to that of Golarion. Although it appears to be the smallest [[Planet|planet]] in its [[Solar system|solar system]], Apostae is not a planet at all; it is a vast [[Spaceship|spaceship]] that was caught in the sun's orbit.



## Description

> Apostae is perceived from outside as a large, rocky [[Asteroid|asteroid]] devoid of life with two strange elements: 

> - Several giant metal doors on the surface.
> - A series of [[Portal|portal]] arches that lead to other parts of the solar system, as well as a unique arch of mystery.
> Scholars also believe that there are portals on this planet that lead to places outside of its solar system.
> Unknown to most of the solar system's inhabitants, Apostae is a huge [[Starship|starship]] with a crew trapped inside.
