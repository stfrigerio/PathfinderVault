> The ***Lirgen's Glory*** was a [[Spaceship|spaceship]] envisioned by [[Elf|elven]] [[Astronomy|astronomer]] [[Gelviel Zorriah]] and launched from [[Oagon]], [[Lirgen]], in [[4600 AR]]. It returned [[4712 AR|112 years later]] to crash south of the [[Nesher Mines]] near the [[Isger|Isgeri]] town of [[Dustpawn]], unleashing the [[Emissary from Beyond]] on the world.


## History

> Gelviel based the *Lirgen's Glory* on a vision he received via a [[Magic|magical]] [[Orrery of distant worlds|orrery]]. Believing the message to be from [[Desna]], he recruited other elves into an expedition to take advantage of their long lifespans for the distant journey.
> The ship left [[Golarion]] on Midsummer's Day in 4600 AR, stocked with [[Dream crystal|dream crystals]] to record the mission and other supplies. After the [[Eye of Abendego]] destroyed Lirgen in [[4606 AR]], the ship lost contact with the [[Saoc Brethren]]; Gelviel continued the mission onward for decades nonetheless, saving their experiences and discoveries in their supply of dream crystals.
> In [[4656 AR]], the *Lirgen's Glory* encountered the [[Dominion of the Black]]'s [[Emissary from Beyond]], which overtook the ship, mutated and suspended its crew, and subverted its mission in order to return to Golarion and prepare it for invasion.


## Construction

> The *Lirgen's Glory* is 200 feet long and 75 feet wide, with 12-foot ceilings in its oak-doored rooms. The ship's 18-inch-thick solid stone hull is incredibly strong, and crystalline cells that store magical energy also serve as one-way observational windows on its exterior and lighting on its interior.
> Magical items, including an array of *bottles of air*, comprise the *Lirgen's Glory'*s life-support systems. Spellcasting crew members provided food and water. Its magical engine is powered by the amplified [[Telekinetic|telekinetic]] powers of a bound [[Vrock|vrock]] and is nearly silent.
