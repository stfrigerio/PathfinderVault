> ***Griffon Unfettered*** was a [[Ship|barkentine]] and the flagship of [[Brance Yoha]] who attempted to use the haunted island now known as the [[Yoha's Graveyard|Yohas Graveyard]] as his base of operation. Yoha and his fleet had been sent by [[Absalom]] to fight the [[Pirate|pirates]] of the [[Shackles]]. More recently, those who dare to inspect the haunted island closer report seeing the dark outline of the *Griffon Unfettered*.
