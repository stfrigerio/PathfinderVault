> The [[Ship|man-o-war]] ***Filthy Lucre*** is the flagship of the fleet of the [[Shackles Pirates]]. It is captained by the self-styled Hurricane King, [[Kerdak Bonefist]]. Its home port is [[Port Peril]], but it is seldom in port for more than a month as Bonefist much prefers to be at sea than on land.
> The ship is one of the few in the [[Inner Sea]] region to be fully equipped with cannon from [[Alkenstar]].


## History

> At a young age, Kerdak became cabin boy on the ***Rock Bottom*** under Captain Keelhaul Thurl, eventually becoming first mate. When the *Rock Bottom* ran into the *[[Naiegoul]]*, captained by the [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] [[Sorcerer|sorceress]] [[Raugsmauda]], Thurl and most of the crew were slain, but Kerdak managed to slip into Raugsmauda's cabin. No one knows what transpired between them, but when Kerdak left the cabin, the *Naiegoul* vanished and Kerdak's right hand had become fleshless bone infused with [[Necromancy|necromantic]] energy. He renamed his ship the *Filthy Lucre* and took the name Kerdak Bonefist.
