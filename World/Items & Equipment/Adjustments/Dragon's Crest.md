# Dragon's Crest

**Item 1**

> This variant on the shield boss is usually shaped like a dragon's head, its jaws open wide enough to wedge a small vessel of liquid within. A dragon's crest can be etched with weapon runes, much like a [[Shield Boss]] or [[Shield Spikes]], but doesn't otherwise alter your shield's statistics. A shield bearing a dragon's crest can't be combined with an [[Attached]] weapon, like shield spikes.You can use an Interact action to wedge an [[Alchemical Bomb]] into the crest's jaws. While a bomb is wedged in the shield, you take a –1 penalty to attack rolls with the shield. When you successfully Strike a creature with the shield, the vessel shatters, exposing the creature you hit—and yourself— to the substance within. This counts as a successful hit with the bomb against the creature if it's adjacent to you or a successful hit against the appropriate adjacent square if it's not. The bomb deals [[Splash]] damage as normal to surrounding creatures, including you. In addition, the bomb deals full damage to the attached shield.
