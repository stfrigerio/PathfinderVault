# Shield Augmentation

**Item 0**

> There are numerous methods to modify shields—snarling rods to catch weapons, bladed edges, padding for nonlethal strikes, and so on—but all share basic functionality. A shield augmentation can be etched with weapon runes, much like a [[Shield Boss]] or [[Shield Spikes]], but doesn't otherwise alter your shield's statistics. A shield bearing an augmentation can't be combined with an [[Attached]] weapon, like shield spikes.A shield augmentation grants your shield one or more weapon traits, chosen when the augmentation is created. You can either choose to add the [[Backswing]] or [[Forceful]] trait, or you can choose two of the following weapon traits: [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Disarm]], [[Nonlethal]], [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Shove]], [[Thrown 10 Feet]], [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Trip]], or [[Versatile S]].
