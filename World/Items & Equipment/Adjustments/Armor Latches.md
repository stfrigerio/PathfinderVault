# Armor Latches

**Item 1**

> This armor is easily doffed. A set of armor with armor latches gains the [[Noisy]] trait; you can't add latches to armor that already possesses the noisy trait. You can remove a set of armor with armor latches with a 3-action activity, which has the [[Manipulate]] trait. This doesn't affect the [[Time It Takes To Don The Armor]].
