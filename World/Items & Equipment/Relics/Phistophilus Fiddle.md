# Phistophilus Fiddle

**Item 3**

> Made of pure gold with platinum strings, the *phistophilus fiddle* shouldn't be able to play a noteâ€”but play it does, so beautifully that it can move almost any audience. The fiddle was stolen from the [[Contract Devil]] who created it, and the cunning fiend still wants to reclaim the instrument. Fiendish misfortunes often befall its owners, allowing it to switch hands. The fiddle is a handheld [[Virtuoso Instrument]].
**Minor Gifts**: : [[Little Helper]], [[Muse]] ( [[Performance]] )
**Major Gifts**: : [[Charming]], [[Fiendish Bargain]] 
**Grand Gift**: : [[Artistic Perfection]] (Performance)
