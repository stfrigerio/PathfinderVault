# Fan of the Four Winds

**Item 4**

> The *fan of the four winds* once belonged to a sage of [[Gozreh]] and was passed down as a sacred relic for generations to those found worthy. Since that time, no one has unlocked the fan's full powers, though many devout priests have used it to aid them in their travels. A worthy member of this order might receive the fan as a reward, as could a suitable helper of the clergy. The fan might also have been lost, allowing for a new wielder to find it. The *fan of the four winds* has the following activation.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You fan in a direction, and the fan casts *[[Gust Of Wind]]*. If this casting is directed toward the sail of a vessel, it instead fills it with swirling air. The vessel gains a +10-foot circumstance bonus to its Speed for 8 hours.
