# Gourd Home

**Item 9**

> This dried gourd seems entirely nondescript, as it is hollow and has a sturdy cord wrapped around its neck for easy carrying. Closer inspection reveals the gourd has grown in the rough shape of a hut or similar small dwelling.

*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Requirements**: The gourd home must be expanded into its house form atop earth or soil.;
**Effect**: By rapping on the door from either outside or inside, you cause the *gourd home* to shrink back into its normal size and appear to be a non-magical gourd sitting on the ground. For the following 8 hours, the interior of the gourd home becomes an extradimensional space whose size appears unchanged to those within.If anyone outside picks up or damages the gourd, or if anyone inside the *gourd home* attempts to exit, all creatures within the *gourd home* immediately reappear in the area surrounding the gourd, and the *gourd home* becomes inactive for 24 hours.
