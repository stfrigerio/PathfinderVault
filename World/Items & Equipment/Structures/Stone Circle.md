# Stone Circle

**Item 10+**

> A *stone circle* appears to be a thumb-sized rectangular gray stone until activated.
**Activate**: (1 minute) envision, Interact;
**Frequency**: once per week;
**Effect**: When the circle is stood on the ground and activated, the stone grows into a massive stone pillar 13 feet high, 7 feet across, and weighing 25 tons. Identical pillars rise up from the ground marking a circle 100 feet across, with capstones connecting the pillars. There must be enough space to deploy the circle or it won't activate. During the activation, you align the *stone circle* to face a single astronomical feature, such as the sun, the moon, or a constellation. You can revert the *stone circle* back to its original state by using an Interact action to push over the original stone pillar. Once you do, the rest of the *stone circle* collapses in a dramatic fashion, the stones falling, cracking, and disintegrating into dust. If you don't begin a ritual inside of the *stone circle* within 1 day of its activation, it reverts back to its original state.When you cast a ritual of 5th level or lower within the *stone circle* , the first failure on a secondary check is improved by one degree of success (a critical failure becomes a failure and a failure becomes a success). Once you complete a ritual within the *stone circle* , regardless of the result, the stones collapse and it reverts back to its original form.
