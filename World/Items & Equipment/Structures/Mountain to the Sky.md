# Mountain to the Sky

**Item 16**

> This tiny, carved walnut shell contains a sacred mountain within. You can only activate *mountain to the sky* on an unoccupied patch of earth or soil. When activated, the walnut transforms into an impossibly steep mountain, 5,000 feet tall and 100 feet wide at the base. Climbing the mountain requires 8 hours and a successful DC 35 [[Athletics]] check. After activating it, if you climb to the top of the mountain without any assistance from flight or magic, the mountain *[[Plane Shifts]]* you to [[Heaven]] when you reach the summit. You can return the *mountain to the sky* into the shape of a walnut shell as a 1-minute activity, which has the [[Concentrate]] and [[Manipulate]] traits, so long as no living creatures are present on the mountain.
