# Magnifying Scope

**Item 3+**

> These scopes use magically enhanced lenses to extend the range of your weapon and help spot distant foes. The scope grants you a +1 item bonus to visual Perception checks to [[Seek]] creatures through the scope.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Effect**: While gazing through the scope, you zoom in on your targets to make it easier to hit them at a distance. You increase the [[Range Increment]] of the weapon to which the scope is attached by 5 feet until the beginning of your next turn or until you're no longer wielding the weapon, whichever comes first.

```
