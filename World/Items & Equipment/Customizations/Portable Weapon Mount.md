# Portable Weapon Mount

**Item 1+**

> Powerful firearms like the [[Arquebus]] were originally used to defend fortifications or ships, mounted on casements or pintles to steady their aim and offset their recoil. More mobile means of stabilizing weapons with [[Kickback]] were developed as firearms began to spread across the Inner Sea. The standard [[Tripod]] takes an Interact action to deploy using one hand.

## Portable Weapon Mount (Monopod)

**Item 1**

**Price**: 2 sp
**Bulk**: 1Monopods are lighter and can be deployed with a single hand using the same action as drawing the firearm. They still require an Interact action to retrieve. Monopods are less stable than a tripod, and firing a kickback weapon from a monopod without the necessary Strength reduces the penalty to a â€“1 circumstance penalty instead of removing it entirely.

## Portable Weapon Mount (Tripod, Shielded)

**Item 3**

**Price**: 50 gp
**Bulk**: 5A shielded tripod resembles a squat shield on a tripod. You can deploy and retrieve a shielded tripod with an Interact action, as normal, but while a shielded tripod is in your square, you can use the [[Take Cover]] action to gain standard cover behind the tripod's shield. You can't use this cover to Hide or Sneak, as normal for times when your cover still leaves your position obvious.
