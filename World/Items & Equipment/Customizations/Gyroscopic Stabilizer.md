# Gyroscopic Stabilizer

**Item 4**

> A *gyroscopic stabilizer* appears as a gold disk suspended within three rotating golden bands inside a gilded case, itself attached to a set of clamps. These clamps allow you to attach the *gyroscopic stabilizer* to any one-handed firearm as an Interact action.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Requirements**: The *gyroscopic stabilizer* is attached to a one-handed firearm without the [[Fatal]] or [[Fatal Aim]] traits;
**Effect**: The gyroscopic stabilizer begins spinning for 1 minute. While the gyroscopic stabilizer is spinning, the weapon it's attached to gains the fatal aim weapon trait with a die one size larger than its damage die (maximum d12). This allows you to wield it in two hands to grant it the fatal trait.
