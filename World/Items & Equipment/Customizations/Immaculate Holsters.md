# Immaculate Holsters

**Item 3**

> This pristine leather belt is made of treated and polished black leather with silver fittings; it features a pair of matching leather holsters that can each fit a one-handed firearm or hand crossbow.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬½{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: Up to two firearms currently holstered in the *immaculate holsters* are instantly cleaned and oiled, protecting them from accidental misfires (though not misfires caused as a result of using a feat or ability). The holstered weapons are also reloaded with non-magical 0-level ammunition appropriate to a weapon of their type; if a firearm has multiple chambers, such as a slide pistol, each empty chamber is loaded. *Immaculate holsters* can't reload the cartridge of a [[Repeating]] weapon.
