# Scope of Truth

**Item 13**

> The *scope of truth* is a bit bigger than most to accommodate larger lenses, which have been magically prepared with tiny shards from crystal balls to reveal the truth. The scope grants you a +2 item bonus to Perception checks made to [[Seek]] in areas you can see through the scope.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: For the next 10 minutes, you can see things through the scope as they actually are. The GM rolls a [[Secret]] [[Counteract]] check with a +20 counteract modifier and a counteract level of 7 against any [[Illusion]] or [[Transmutation]] in the area, but only for the purpose of determining whether you see through it, not to end the spell or effect. For instance, if the check succeeds against a [[Polymorph]] spell, you can see the creature's true form, but you don't end the spell.

```
