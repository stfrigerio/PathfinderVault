# Gunner's Bandolier

**Item 3**

> This incredibly spacious bandolier can hold up to 4 one-handed crossbows or firearms that take no more than 1 action to completely reload (typically meaning that weapons with the [[Capacity]] or [[Repeating]] traits won't fit in the bandolier's holsters). A *gunner's bandolier* can be etched with runes as though it were a ranged weapon. When you invest the *gunner's bandolier* , you can attune it to each of the 4 weapons holstered in it.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Effect**: You empower one of the attuned weapons in the bandolier, granting it the runes etched onto the *gunner's bandolier* and removing the runes from any previously drawn weapon. Then, you Interact to draw the weapon.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬽{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Effect**: All weapons that were attuned to the bandolier when you invested it, not including any weapons you're currently wielding, return to the bandolier, and one of the returned weapons is automatically reloaded.

```
