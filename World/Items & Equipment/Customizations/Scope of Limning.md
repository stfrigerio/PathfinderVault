# Scope of Limning

**Item 10**

> The dwarven gunsmiths of Dongun Hold originally created these scopes to help them clear out vermin in underground areas. This scope captures the sound that echoes off a creature hit by the firearm and transforms it into light, illuminating the target for all to see.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact ([[Auditory]] *[[Light]]* [[Transmutation]]) 
**Effect**: If your next Strike from the weapon to which the scope is attached hits a creature, the sound of the impact transforms into light, causing the creature to glow until the end of your next turn. A visible creature can't be [[Concealed]] while they glow. If a creature is [[Invisible]], they're concealed while glowing, rather than being [[Undetected]]. Because the effect requires a solid impact, [[Incorporeal]] creatures are unaffected unless the bullet can deal force damage or has the effects of the *[[Ghost Touch]]* property rune.
