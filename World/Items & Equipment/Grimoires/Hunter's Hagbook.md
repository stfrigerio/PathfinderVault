# Hunter's Hagbook

**Item 9**

> This magical book has its official title, *The Grimoire of Lady Jayne Cutter* , written on an inside page in illuminated letters. Among occultists and other scholars, it's known by its colloquial name: the *Hunter's Hagbook*. The book is a grimoire created and used by a legendary Varisian monster hunter. The *Hunter's Hagbook* can hold 100 spells but the following spells are always present in the book, can't be removed from it, and count against the total: *[[Blind Eye]]*, *[[Blood Duplicate]]*, *[[Caster'S Imposition]]*, *[[Hag'S Fruit]]*, *[[Ritual Obstruction]]*, *[[Web Of Influence]]* When you attempt a saving throw against a [[Coven]] spell, you can immediately end the duration of a spell affecting you that you prepared from this book. If you do, the result of your saving throw is one degree of success better than your roll (for example, a critical failure becomes a failure).
