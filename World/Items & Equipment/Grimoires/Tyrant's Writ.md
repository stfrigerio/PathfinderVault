# Tyrant's Writ

**Item 8**

> A spirited debate persists among scholars on whether the eponymous tyrant of this grimoire actually refers to Tar-Baphon, the necromancer Geb, or even the goddess [[Urgathoa]] herself. This grimoire appears at first to be a series of writs that makes arrogant demands of the reader, those around them, and the universe. Anyone who gives these writings more than a cursory look realizes the writs hold spells much like any other grimoire, with the *[[Animate Dead]]* spell being particularly prominent. *Tyrant's writs* grants you the ability to demand more from the [[Undead]] you animate.
