# Bestiary of Metamorphosis

**Item 6**

> This grimoire fancifully illustrates the spells you inscribe within it with illuminated drawings of creatures that have never existed, the pictures changing to depict new ones from time to time.

*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* envision ([[Polymorph]] [[Transmutation]]) 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Requirements**: You're under the effect of a polymorph spell you prepared from this grimoire that offers a choice of multiple forms;
**Effect**: You transform into a different form allowed by the polymorph by bending and molding the spell's energy. This reduces the spell's remaining duration by half.
