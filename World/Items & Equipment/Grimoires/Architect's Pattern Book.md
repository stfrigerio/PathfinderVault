# Architect's Pattern Book

**Item 6**

> Typically created by [[Wizards]] who are hobbyists or professional architects, an *architect's pattern book* allows the caster  to customize certain spells that create magical structures or domiciles, adding recreational areas such as an indoor bathhouse, gaming room, swimming pool, or similar luxury.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â­“{.Pathfinder }* envision ([[Metamagic]]) 
**Frequency**: once per week;
**Effect**: If your next action is to cast a *[[Cozy Cabin]]*, *[[Magnificent Mansion]]*, or *[[Resplendent Mansion]]* spell, you add a room to the structure that is up to 10 feet per side per level of the spell. This room is outfitted with all the accoutrements for a particular type of recreation, determined by you when you cast the spell. Any character who spends at least 1 hour using this recreational facility and then sleeps a full 8 hours inside the location created by the spell is exceptionally well-rested. They regain double the amount of Hit Points they would normally receive for an 8-hour [[Rest]], and when they make the next day's preparations, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Athletics]] checks and Will saves for the next 12 hours.
