# Corrosive Engravings

**Item 5**

> These tin sheets are bound in brass and show significant signs of erosion. The grimoire's title is acid-etched, and flipping between the sheets leaves your fingers covered in flecks of rust and powdery metal.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â­“{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: If your next action is to cast an [[Acid]] or [[Poison]] spell that deals [[Persistent Damage]], any creature who takes persistent damage from the spell is also [[Sickened 2]] until the persistent damage ends. Using an action to retch can reduce the sickened value as normal, but it can't reduce the sickened value below 1 until the persistent damage ends.
