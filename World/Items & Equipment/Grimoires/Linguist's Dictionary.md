*â­“{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Requirements**: Your last action was to cast a spell prepared from this grimoire that allows understanding of another language, such as *[[Comprehend Languages]]* or *[[Tongues]]* ;
**Effect**: The grimoire absorbs knowledge of one language translated this way (caster's choice if more than one), allowing its bearer to communicate on a rudimentary level in that language even after the spell's duration has elapsed. The *linguist's dictionary* can hold one language at a time.
