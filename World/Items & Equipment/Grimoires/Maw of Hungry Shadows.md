# Maw of Hungry Shadows

**Item 18**

> Shadows swirl around this soot-black tome, swallowing up any light that touches them. A faint whispering emanates from the grimoire's pages when opened.

**Frequency**: once per day;
**Requirements**: Your last action was to cast a spell prepared from this grimoire that has the [[Shadow]] trait;
