# Illuminated Folio

**Item 14**

> The pages of this part-spellbook, part-bestiary are illustrated with all manner of creatures, magical and mundane. The illustrations shift and move around the page when examined.

*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* envision ([[Metamagic]]) 
**Effect**: If your next action is to cast a [[Conjuration]] spell prepared from this grimoire that summons one or more creatures, you summon creatures from the *illuminated folio* rather than their usual source. These summoned creatures appear as living illustrations, granting them resistance to physical damage equal to half their level and weakness 5 to fire and to any ability with the [[Water]] trait. They can also fold themselves up to pass through spaces only an inch or so wide as part of their movement.
