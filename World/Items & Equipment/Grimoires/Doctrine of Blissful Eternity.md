# Doctrine of Blissful Eternity

**Item 7**

> The bones of small animals decorate the cover of this tome, creating a pattern that resembles a gross perversion of [[Pharasma'S]] holy symbol.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬²{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Trigger**: An [[Undead]] minion you summoned or created using a spell prepared from this grimoire takes damage that would bring it to 0 Hit Points;
**Effect**: You call out and demand the undead to remain, reaching out with tendrils of negative energy that preserves your minion so it might continue to serve you. Expend a spell slot in which you've prepared a *[[Harm]]* spell to restore 1d8 Hit Points to your undead minion per level of the expended spell slot, before applying the damage. If this prevents the minion from being reduced to 0 Hit Points, it isn't destroyed.

```
