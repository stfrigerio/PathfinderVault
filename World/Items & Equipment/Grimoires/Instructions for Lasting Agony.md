# Instructions for Lasting Agony

**Item 5**

> This worn and stained manual emits a chill when opened.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* envision ([[Metamagic]]) 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: If your next action is to cast a harmful [[Necromancy]] spell that you prepared from this grimoire and that allows a saving throw, you warp and twist negative energy into the spell to cause intense pain. If the target fails its saving throw against the spell, it becomes [[Sickened 1]] by the pain.
