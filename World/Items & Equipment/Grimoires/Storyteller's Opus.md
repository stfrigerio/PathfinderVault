# Storyteller's Opus

**Item 6**

> This green spellbook with gold trim contains a cautionary story about a boy who was eaten by a wolf after he previously lied about wolf attacks. When opened, the engravings on the front seem to move in a loop, enacting this story.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬²{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Trigger**: A creature succeeds, but doesn't critically succeed, at a Perception check to disbelieve an [[Illusion]] spell you prepared from this grimoire;
**Effect**: You quickly tell a fib to try to smooth over the inconsistencies in your illusion. Attempt a [[Deception]] check against the triggering creature's Perception DC. If you succeed, the creature doesn't disbelieve the illusion.

```
