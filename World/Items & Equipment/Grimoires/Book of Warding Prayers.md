# Book of Warding Prayers

**Item 8**

> Script in a language of the Outer Planes adorns this book's spine, and a deity's symbol is etched on its cover. *Books of warding prayers* are each devoted to a particular deity and are also a [[Religious Symbol]] of that deity.

*â­“{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Trigger**: Your last action was to cast a prepared divine spell granted by your deity;
**Effect**: Choose chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; you can't choose a type that's part of your deity's alignment. You and all allies within 30 feet are suffused with your deity's protection, gaining resistance 10 to damage of that type for 1 minute.
