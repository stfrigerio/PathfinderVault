# Spy Staff

**Item 7+**

> In its normal form, a *spy staff* is a slim rod of burnished wood with subtle etchings of eyes upon its sides. The first to develop the *spy staff* were agents of Andoran's Twilight Talons, but such staves have spread to espionage agencies throughout the Inner Sea region and beyond.

**Effect**: You change the shape and appearance of this staff to that of an ordinary handheld accessory of your choosing of the same Bulk. The staff's statistics don't change. Only a creature benefiting from *[[True Seeing]]* or a similar effect can attempt to disbelieve this illusion, with a DC of 27.
