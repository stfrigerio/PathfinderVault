# Spellstriker Staff

**Item 7+**

> A *spellstriker staff* is wrought iron with gleaming arcane sigils etched into its surface and a sharp point at the bottom. Used as a weapon, the staff is a *+1 [[Striking]] [[Shifting]] [[Staff]]*.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⭓{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Trigger**: You use [[Spellstrike]] with a non-cantrip spell and miss with the Strike;
**Effect**: An explosion of magical energy—stored up for the Spellstrike—explodes out. All creatures in a 5-foot emanation take 1d6 damage per level of the spell, with a [[Basic]] Reflex save against your spell DC. This damage is the same type the spell would have dealt, and the activation gains that trait; if the spell would have dealt multiple types of damage, choose one of them. If the damage of the explosion is mental, the save is Will instead of Reflex.
