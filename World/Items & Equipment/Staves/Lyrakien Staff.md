# Lyrakien Staff

**Item 6+**

> A crystalline sphere, swirling with constantly shifting constellations, sits atop a *lyrakien staff* , a silver shaft that sparkles with the gentle glow of starlight. [[Desnans]] first created the staves, inspired by the music- and freedom-loving [[Lyrakien Azatas]], but these staves are popular with spellcasters of all faiths who like travel, art, or the stars. While wielding a *lyrakien staff* , you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against [[Incapacitation]] effects.
**Activate**: Cast a Spell;
**Effect**: You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
**Craft Requirements**: Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.
