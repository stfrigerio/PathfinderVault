# Celestial Staff

**Item 17**

> Heavenly radiance shines from an active *celestial staff,* a golden staff capped with a pair of sculpted [[Angel'S]] wings. Used as a weapon, the staff is a *+2 [[Greater Striking]] [[Holy]] [[Staff]]*. While wielding a *celestial staff* , you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that have the [[Evil]] trait and effects created by evil creatures. When you prepare this staff, if you're evil, you become [[Drained 1]] until your next daily preparations.
**Activate**: Cast a Spell;
**Effect**: You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
**Craft Requirements**: You're good. Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.
