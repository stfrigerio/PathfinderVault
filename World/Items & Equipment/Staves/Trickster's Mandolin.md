# Trickster's Mandolin

**Item 4+**

> Sought after by many unscrupulous [[Bards]], this instrument is surprisingly light and easy to carry, but also empowered with a number of spells carefully selected to help with fooling others or making a hasty retreat. While playing the mandolin, you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Deception]] and [[Performance]] checks.
