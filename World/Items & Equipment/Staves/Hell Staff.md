# Hell Staff

**Item 17**

> A *hell staff* is a tall, pointed staff forged of red-tinted steel with [[Infernal]] inscriptions that march neatly down its sides. At its top sits an inverted ruby pyramid divided into nine sections. Found mostly in Cheliax or other lands where [[Diabolic]] influences hold sway, when used as a weapon the staff is a *+3 [[Greater Striking]] [[Axiomatic]] [[Unholy]] [[Staff]]*. When you prepare this staff, if you're chaotic or good, you become [[Drained 1]] until your next daily preparations.The staff's *[[Summon Lesser Servitor]]* spell can be used only to summon animals with the [[Bestiary/Fiend]] trait, devils, or [[Hell Hounds]] (at 4th level). Its *[[Summon Fiend]]* spell can summon only devils or hell hounds.
**Activate**: Cast a Spell;
**Effect**: You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
**Craft Requirements**: You're lawful evil. Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.
