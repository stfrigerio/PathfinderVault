# Guardian Staff

**Item 6+**

> A *guardian staff* is formed from ivory strands woven in a diamond pattern and capped with a glowing ruby. Those charged with protecting others value this staff's spells.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Effect**: You raise the staff and choose an ally within 10 feet. A ruby-colored plane of force appears like a shield near the ally, granting them a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. If you use this action again, any creature you previously granted this bonus to loses it.
