# Gambler's Staff

**Item 12**

> A small glass orb on the head of a *gambler's staff* holds a pair of six-sided dice that shift and roll within. Spellcasters who make their living via games of chance use *gamblers' staves* to encourage the odds in their favor. Most gambling dens ban players they discover using such magic items. A *gambler's staff* grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Earn Income]] from gambling (typically using [[Games Lore]] ). To get this benefit, the staff must be on your person during all the downtime you spend gambling.
**Activate**: Cast a Spell;
**Effect**: You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
**Craft Requirements**: Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.
