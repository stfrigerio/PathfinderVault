# Ringmaster's Staff

**Item 6+**

> This highly polished black wooden staff resembles an aristocrat’s oversized walking cane, complete with a silver head shaped like a large circus animal such as a horse or elephant. Ringmasters or announcers use *ringmaster’s staves* to draw attention from their audiences or to salvage acts that fall flat mid-performance. While wielding a *ringmaster’s staff* , your normal voice can be clearly heard by all creatures within 300 feet regardless of intervening barriers or ambient noise, although your voice can’t penetrate magical silence and you can’t use this to extend an [[Auditory]] or [[Sonic]] effect through barriers that would otherwise block it.
**Activate**: Cast a Spell;
**Effect**: You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
**Craft Requirements**: Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.
