# Stargazer's Spyglass

**Item 4**

> This ornate [[Spyglass]] has a brass tube inscribed with constellations and green-tinted lens. It's often used by field astronomers to pick out greater details among stars and other celestial bodies. Like a typical spyglass, you can see eight times farther while looking through a *stargazer's spyglass*.
