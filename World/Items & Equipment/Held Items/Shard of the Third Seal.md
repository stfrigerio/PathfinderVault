# Shard of the Third Seal

**Item 9**

> This stone fragment from the *Third Seal* retains a tiny sliver of that legendary item's power. The shard sheds light constantly, with the effects of a [[Torch]] requiring no oxygen and generating no heat. The flame can be covered or hidden, but it can't be smothered or quenched.
