# Ivory Baton

**Item 13+**

> This white, slender rod bears intricately carved reliefs of magnificent animals that bow and dance to some unseen commander. The baton enables you to command [[Constructs]].

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact ([[Enchantment]] [[Incapacitation]]) 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You take control of a construct. This has the effects of *[[Dominate]]* with a DC of 30, but it affects only constructs. It lacks the [[Mental]] trait and functions on [[Mindless]] constructs. It also ignores any [[Golem Antimagic]] the target might have. The effect's duration ends if the baton is destroyed or leaves your possession for at least 1 minute, and you can issue commands to the target only while holding the baton.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per round;
**Effect**: You closely direct the actions of one construct you control and can see within 60 feet. That construct gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws (except saving throws against the *ivory baton* ).

```
