# Bullhook

**Item 3+**

> A *bullhook* is a stout rod about 4 feet long with a blunt hook on the end. Too dull to be useful as a weapon, a *bullhook* is instead used to direct animals in training or in performing their tasks. A *bullhook* grants you an item bonus to [[Nature]] checks to [[Command An Animal]] while you are holding it.
