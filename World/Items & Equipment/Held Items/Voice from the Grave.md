# Voice from the Grave

**Item 10**

> This onyx skull emits eerie whispers when on its own, but when held the skull enables you to speak with [[Spirits]] and [[Haunts]] you can see, even if you don't share a language. The voice from the grave translates anything the spirit or haunt says, using a language you understand, and translates your words for the spirit or haunt in kind. This doesn't make the target [[Friendly]] or even cooperative, but it does enable communication. The GM determines the language in the case of a haunt. You can't communicate with mindless spirits using the skull.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* command, envision; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: The onyx skull casts a DC 27 *[[Charm]]* spell on one spirit or haunt you can communicate with using the skull. If you target a haunt that doesn't have a Will modifier, it automatically gets a failure on its save.

```
