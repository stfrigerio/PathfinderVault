# Skull Bomb

**Item 8**

> This device is a human-sized skull crafted entirely from metal plating and clockwork gears, which slots easily into a human [[Skeleton]] in the spot where an ordinary skull would normally be located. While performing a *[[Create Undead]]* ritual, you can attach this skull bomb to the target creature in place of its own head. In order to do so, the target creature must be Medium and have the [[Humanoid]] trait. The target creature can have only one skull bomb attached in this fashion. The creature gains the following ability.
**Throw Skull**: 
( [[Manipulate]] ) The creature detaches its skull bomb and hurls the volatile explosive at a point within 30 feet. The skull explodes, dealing 7d6 fire damage to creatures within a 15-foot burst (DC 24 [[Basic]] Reflex save). The skull is permanently destroyed and can't be used again, and the throwing creature is permanently [[Blinded]] and headless.
