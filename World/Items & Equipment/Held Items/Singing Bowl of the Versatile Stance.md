# Singing Bowl of the Versatile Stance

**Item 11**

> In true Iroran form, the simplicity of this small, inverted copper bell belies its flawlessness. When struck with a mallet (included with the singing bowl), it emits a harmonious tone that inspires bodily perfection in those who know how to hear it.

**Effect**: While holding the *singing bowl of the versatile stance* with one hand, you strike the lip of it with a mallet held in the other. Anyone within 60 feet currently in a stance can spend a reaction to use one of their [[Stance]] actions in order to change to a different stance.
