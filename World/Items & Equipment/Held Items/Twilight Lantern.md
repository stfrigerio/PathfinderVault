# Twilight Lantern

**Item 6+**

> This elegant hooded lantern is made from onyx-black metal. In dim light, flecks of white metal speckled within the lantern's housing resemble stars in a night sky. The lantern uses oil as a standard hooded lantern, except that any light the lantern emits is converted into magical light similar to moonlight. This magical moonlight is always dim light.
