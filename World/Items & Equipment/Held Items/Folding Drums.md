# Folding Drums

**Item 5**

> You can unfold this virtuoso percussion instrument into a hand drum (1 Bulk), a marching drum set with a shoulder harness and back brace (3 Bulk), or a large standing drum set with a built-in stool (16 Bulk). Changing the folding drum's size is a 3-action Interact activity, and the drums must have sufficient open space to accommodate their new size.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact ([[Concentrate]]) 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You play a pounding rhythm on the drum. If the next action you use is to cast a [[Composition]] cantrip that has an emanation, increase the area of the emanation by 30 feet.

```
