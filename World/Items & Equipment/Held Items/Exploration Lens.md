# Exploration Lens

**Item 10+**

> An *exploration lens* is a magical glass lens designed for a [[Bull'S-Eye Lantern]]. When light from the lantern passes through the lens, it alters the light to make it easier to perform a common exploration activity with the lantern. You can find more information about exploration activities related to these lenses on page 496 of the Core Rulebook. Alternatively, an *exploration lens* can be installed in a *[[Wayfinder]]* like an *[[Aeon Stone]]*. In this case, light (such as that from a lantern, [[Torch]], or *[[Light]]* spell) must still pass through the lens and you must hold the *wayfinder* in your hand for it to function.There are several different types of exploration lens, each granting benefits with a different type of exploration activity. Each type of lens is distinguishable from all the other types by holding it up to a bright light.

## Exploration Lens (Detecting)

**Item 10**

**Price**: 1,000 gpWhen held up to light, this lens sparkles as though infused with glitter. While [[Detecting Magic]] in exploration mode, when the lantern's light falls upon something you detect as magical, it pulsates faintly. This makes it easier to triangulate the magic, since you can use the cone of the bull's-eye lantern instead of the circular pulse of *[[Detect Magic]]*. You also gain a +2 item bonus to checks to [[Identify Magic]] within the light.

## Exploration Lens (Investigating)

**Item 12**

**Price**: 1,750 gpThe outer rim of this lens glows faintly when held up to the light. While activated, the lens grants you a +1 item bonus to skill checks to [[Recall Knowledge]] while [[Investigating]] by outlining potential clues in a way that triggers your memory. If you're Investigating something while using the lens, you can always roll a Recall Knowledge skill check appropriate to the investigation for initiative.

## Exploration Lens (Searching)

**Item 14**

**Price**: 4,000 gpThis lens has an opalescent sheen when held up to light. The lens subtly outlines hidden doors and concealed hazards, granting you a +2 item bonus to Perception checks to spot such features while [[Searching]]. Even if you aren't Searching, you get a check to find [[Traps]] that normally require you to Search.
