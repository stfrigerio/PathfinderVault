# Drum of Upheaval

**Item 20**

> This heavy drum is engraved along the sides with images of centaurs in fierce combat. The drum grants you a +3 item bonus on [[Performance]] checks you make using the drum. Additionally, it imparts the rhythms of two songs upon your mind as soon as you touch it. One is a fast marching cadence; the other is a frenetic ritual dance. Each song has a different activation.
