# Fulu Compendium

**Item 9**

> This pamphlet-sized book records the various symbols seen on fulu and also contains some ready-made magic on a special page that restores itself every day at sunrise. Using the compendium as a reference grants a +2 item bonus to any skill checks to determine a fulu's function or authenticity.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You rip a page from the *fulu compendium* and cast it in a wide arc; as it flies in that arc, it multiplies into a storm of fulus. All undead creatures in a 30-foot emanation are affected by a *[[Spirit-Sealing Fulu]]* with a save DC of 25.
