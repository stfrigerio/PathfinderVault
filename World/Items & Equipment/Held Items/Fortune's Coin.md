# Fortune's Coin

**Item 8+**

> This coin is struck with the image of a beatific seraph in gold on one side and a fearsome fiend with seven eyes enameled in black on the other. While it may seem nothing more than a curiosity, it's a powerful agent of fortune when activated.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬²{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Trigger**: You fail a check or attack;
**Effect**: Flip the coin. If it lands on the seraph side, you get a 12 on the die instead of what you rolled. If it lands on the fiend side, one of the eyes on the fiend closes. Either way, you're temporarily immune to *fortune's coin* for 1 hour. When all seven eyes are closed, the coin vanishes into a puff of smoke, disappearing forever. This activation is a [[Fortune]] effect, regardless of how the coin flip lands.
