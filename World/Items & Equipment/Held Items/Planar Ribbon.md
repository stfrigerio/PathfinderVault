# Planar Ribbon

**Item 20**

> By twisting and twirling this ordinary-looking leather ribbon, you can temporarily bend a rift in space.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per round;
**Effect**: You extend the ribbon to brush against a foe up to 60 feet away. If that creature fails a DC 42 Reflex save, you exchange positions with the target and all of that creature's allies are [[Flat-Footed]] to you until the end of your turn. This activation has the [[Teleportation]] trait.

```
