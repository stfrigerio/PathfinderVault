# Lantern of Empty Light

**Item 6**

> It's said that the pale blue light of this eldritch lantern shines from another dimension or even is linked, somehow, to the glow of a ghost when it is consumed by the Outer Goddess [[Nhimbaloth]]. A lantern of empty light is not intrinsically an evil item, though it remains a favored tool of those who would manipulate the minds of others for sinister reasons. It can be used as a normal [[Bull'S-Eye Lantern]], but prolonged use tends to instill in the user a vague sense of being watched by unseen eyes.
