# Dreamstone

**Item 9+**

> A *dreamstone* is a disc-shaped object carved with imagery or words sacred to [[Desna]] —be it her religious symbol, a short prayer, or merely the shape of a single star. When you carry a *dreamstone* , you find it easier to fall asleep, and you gain improved effects from the resulting rest. You always fall asleep within 5 minutes of lying down with the intention of sleeping, and you require only 2 hours of sleep per day to gain the benefits of 8 hours of sleep, provided you have carried the *dreamstone* for at least 24 hours prior to resting. As long as you carry a *dreamstone* , you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against sleep effects.

## Cursed Dreamstone

**Item 9**

**Usage**: held in 1 hand;
**Bulk**: LA *dreamstone* can become cursed if left exposed to creatures that corrupt sleep, generate nightmares, or otherwise prey on sleeping or dreaming victims via supernatural methods. A *cursed dreamstone* seems to function as a normal *dreamstone* until the bearer falls asleep or is forced to attempt a saving throw against a sleep effect. At this point, the person carrying the cursed *dreamstone* must attempt a DC 26 Will save to resist the curse’s effects.
**Critical Success**: The character resists the curse entirely and experiences a vivid dream while sleeping that warns them of the nature of the *cursed dreamstone*.
**Success**: The character resists the curse.
**Failure**: As long as the cursed character possesses the stone, they are fatigued whenever they wake from sleep, whether natural or magically induced, and they take a –2 item penalty to all saving throws against sleep effects instead of gaining the normal bonus from a *dreamstone*.
**Critical Failure**: As failure, and whenever the bearer attempts a saving throw against a sleep effect, they get the outcome that is one degree worse than the result of their saving throw.
