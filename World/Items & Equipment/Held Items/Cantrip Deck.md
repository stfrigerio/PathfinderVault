# Cantrip Deck

**Item 1+**

> In an effort to spread the knowledge of magic as widely as possible, worshippers of [[Nethys]] discovered a way to bind cantrips into cards accessible even to non-spellcasters. The deck contains thick parchment cards, each roughly half the size of a playing card. In precise, no-nonsense script, each card simply states the name of its cantrip, color-coded based on its school.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* or more (envision, Interact); 
**Effect**: You envision your desired cantrip, causing its card to rise to the top of the deck, and draw the card. The deck casts that cantrip as a 1st-level spell, with a DC of 15 and a spell attack modifier of +5. The card crumbles into dust as the cantrip takes effect. The activation takes the same number of actions as the cantrip you chose takes to cast.

```
