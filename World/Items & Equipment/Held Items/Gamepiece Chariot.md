# Gamepiece Chariot

**Item 11**

> This stone figurine of a chariot pulled by two horses was used by Tekritanin adults during strategy game competitions. Sometimes, though, mischievous adolescents snatched pieces like this one for joyriding.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You place the figurine on the ground and roll it forward. As the chariot begins to move, it rapidly expands to the size of a Large [[Heavy Chariot]] pulled by two animated stone [[War Horses]]. You can board the chariot and drive it up to 80 feet in a straight line. You can move through spaces occupied by creatures of size Medium or smaller, dealing 4d8+10 bludgeoning damage to those creatures. Affected creatures must attempt a DC 28 [[Basic]] Reflex save; on a failure, a creature is knocked [[Prone]]. The chariot returns to its figurine form once it stops moving.
