# Grail of Twisted Desires

**Item 10**

> This timeworn chalice is constructed of dull tin. It has an unassuming appearance save for the gold, silver, and ebony rings that encircle its rim.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: three times per day;
**Effect**: The chalice fills with one of three different wines of your choosing, as described below. The wine looks, tastes, and smells the same regardless of which type you choose, and *[[Detect Magic]]* has no effect on the liquid beyond indicating that it is magical.If you aren’t chaotic, the first time each day you activate the chalice, there is a one-in-six chance that the liquid you conjure is a different type (the GM should roll 1d6 as a secret roll) instead. The second and third times you activate the chalice in the same day, the odds of this happening increase to two-in-six or three-in-six, respectively. If you are chaotic, the chalice always works as intended.
