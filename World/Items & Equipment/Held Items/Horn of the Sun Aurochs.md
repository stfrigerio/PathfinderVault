# Horn of the Sun Aurochs

**Item 13**

> A horn of the sun aurochs grants a +2 item bonus to [[Performance]] checks when played as an instrument.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: The horn is clearly audible for hundreds of feet, but within a 20-foot emanation, the sound causes agony in those who wish harm upon the user; the horn also sheds [[Bright Light]] in that area and [[Dim Light]] to the next 20 feet. Enemies of the user in this area take 7d6 sonic damage and 7d6 good damage ( [[Basic]] DC 30 Fortitude save). Creatures that are specifically vulnerable to sunlight are also [[Frightened 1]] if they fail this save or frightened 2 on a critical failure. This activation also attempts to [[Counteract]] any [[Darkness]] or [[Sleep]] effects in the area (+23 counteract check).
