# Lich Soul Cage

**Item 12**

> This item is crafted by a spellcaster who wishes to become a lich. When a lich is destroyed, its soul flees to the soul cage. The soul cage then rebuilds the lich's undead body over the course of 1d10 days. Afterward, the lich manifests next to the soul cage, fully healed and in a new body (therefore, it lacks any equipment it had on its old body). A lich's soul cage must be destroyed to prevent a lich from returning.The standard soul cage is a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment inscribed with magical phrases. This box has Hardness 9 and 36 HP, but some liches devise more durable or difficult-to-obtain soul cages. A soul cage might also come in the form of a ring, an amulet, or a similar item; the specifics are up to the creator.
