# Jug of Fond Remembrance

**Item 4**

> This large jug always seems to contain just enough of the holder's favorite alcohol to share with a friend. As long as you're holding the jug, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Diplomacy]] checks. If you share a sip of the liquor from the jug with a creature, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your next Diplomacy check to [[Make An Impression]] or [[Request]] something from that creature any time within the next month.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You take a long swig on the jug and then [[Recall Knowledge]] about a creature you can see, with a +2 circumstance bonus to the check. If you fail but don't critically fail this check, you get a success instead. You're then [[Stupefied 1]] for 3 rounds.

```
