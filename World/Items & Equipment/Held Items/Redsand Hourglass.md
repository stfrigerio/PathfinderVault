# Redsand Hourglass

**Item 23**

> This platinum hourglass is filled with red sand, is decorated with imagery of roses and whippoorwills with tiny black onyx eyes, and has the ability to manipulate time. Once used by [[Pharasma]] herself, the *Redsand Hourglass* was stolen from Pharasma's court a millennia ago. While the hourglass is in your possession, you're immune to the [[Paralyzed]], [[Slowed]], and [[Stunned]] conditions.
