# Corpse Compass

**Item 3**

> This bone [[Compass]], made of the bones of sapient creatures that died violent deaths, is eerily effective when it comes to locating corpses. If you know you're [[Tracking]] a creature that's dead, you can use the compass's idiosyncrasies to your advantage and gain a +2 item bonus to your [[Survival]] check to do so. Otherwise, it works as a normal compass.
