# Scroll Case of Simplicity

**Item 4+**

> The four different types of *scroll cases of simplicity* often bear adornments appropriate to their magical tradition, such as angelic wings or otherworldly lettering. On the inside, intricate runic diagrams spiral out to surround the scroll stored within. A scroll placed within the case can be converted into energy to cast consistently useful spells depending on its type. You must be able to cast spells of a given tradition to use a *scroll case of simplicity* of a corresponding type.

**Requirements**: The scroll case contains a single scroll of a 1st-level spell;
**Effect**: You transfer the scroll’s energy into the scroll case, consuming the scroll, and you can immediately begin casting one of the scroll case’s spells.
