# Mindsponge

**Item 9**

> A *mindsponge* appears as a misshapen gray sponge that unsettlingly resembles a malformed human brain. Though pliable in all the same ways as a damp sponge, a *mindsponge* has no ability to absorb water and, in fact, doesn't seem terribly porous at all. Instead, a *mindsponge* is used to absorb thoughts and memories from living creatures.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* envision, Interact; 
**Effect**: The *mindsponge* casts *[[Modify Memory]]*, but only to erase a memory—a *mindsponge* can't enhance memory clarity, alter memories, or add false memories.

```
