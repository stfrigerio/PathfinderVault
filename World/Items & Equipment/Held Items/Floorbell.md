# Floorbell

**Item 5**

> This surprisingly sturdy 3-foot-by-3-foot clay tile resembles a thick pressure plate. It can support up to 500 pounds of weight atop it before it is destroyed. The *floorbell's* nature is obvious at a glance, but mundane or magical means can obscure or camouflage the tile (such as by covering it in scattered leaves or by casting an *[[Illusory Object]]* spell) to make it harder to detect.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact; 
**Effect**: The *floorbell* must be activated on level ground. When you do, specify the amount of weight that triggers the *floorbell's* alarm system. When the amount of weight you specify (or more) is placed on the *floorbell* , it emits an ear-piercing wail clearly audible to a range of 150 feet. A *floorbell* can also ring an alarm if a weight you specify is removed from the *floorbell* , such as if you activated it while a heavy sack was on it.
