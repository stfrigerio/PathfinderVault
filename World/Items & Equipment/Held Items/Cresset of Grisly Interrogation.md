# Cresset of Grisly Interrogation

**Item 9**

> This iron cresset appears as a cage-like basket with a metal bowl fitted into its base—a bowl sized perfectly to hold the severed head of a Medium or Small humanoid.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬽{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You open the cresset by detaching the top and folding it back on a hinge so that a decapitated head can be placed inside the bowl. Once the cage lid is folded back over the head and latched in place, and as long as the decapitated head has been dead for no longer than 10 minutes before being placed inside the cresset, the head is no longer subject to decay, and bugs and pests (such as maggots) are prevented from consuming the remains. This doesn't prevent the rest of the corpse or its soul from becoming [[Undead]], nor does it prevent effects that restore life to the dead (but note that some spells, such as *[[Raise Dead]]*, can't be used to restore life to a decapitated corpse in the first place). If the head is later removed from within the cresset, the head's delayed decay immediately catches up with it in a few seconds, rendering it useless for further use inside of a *cresset of grisly interrogation*.
