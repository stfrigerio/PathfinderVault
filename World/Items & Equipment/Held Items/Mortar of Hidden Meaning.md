# Mortar of Hidden Meaning

**Item 4**

> This matching mortar and pestle are made from immaculate darkwood that looks nearly olive in the right light.
**Activate**: 1 minute (Interact);
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You use the *mortar of hidden meaning* to grind tea leaves (or another suitable substance for making a hot beverage). While grinding the tea leaves, which takes no less than 1 minute, you can speak a message into the mortar. After the leaves are steeped in hot water, the first person who drinks from the resulting brew hears the message whispered in their ear.
