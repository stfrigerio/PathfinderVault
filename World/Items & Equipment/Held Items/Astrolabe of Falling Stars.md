# Astrolabe of Falling Stars

**Item 5**

> This [[Astrolabe]] is fashioned of magically attuned platinum plates and rings and is inset with carefully measured ruby gems. The astrolabe's back is engraved with helpful charts, a calendar, and a maker's mark. An *astrolabe of falling stars* can be used as a mariner's astrolabe. In addition, it can produce the following magical effect.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: With a flick of your finger, you set the astrolabe's rule spinning, causing the inset rubies to become a blur. Choose a point within 100 feet. The *astrolabe of falling stars* calls down a brief rain of meteorites in a 10-foot burst centered on that point, dealing 1d8 bludgeoning and 1d8 fire damage to creatures in the area (DC 19 [[Basic]] Reflex save).
