# Ghost Lantern

**Item 12**

> Crafted from [[Cold Iron]], this black hooded lantern has gray glass and lenses that emit a pale gray light when the lantern is lit. Anything this light falls on looks gray or desaturated. The lantern uses [[Oil]] as a [[Standard Hooded Lantern]]. The lantern's light shines within the [[Ethereal Plane]] as well as the [[Material Plane]]. On any other plane, the light functions as a normal hooded lantern.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Requirements**: The lantern's shutters are open;
**Effect**: You concentrate on the lantern's light to soften the boundary between the Ethereal and Material Plane. Any creature in the lantern's [[Bright Light]] on the Material Plane gains the effects of the *[[Ghost Touch]]* property rune on all its weapons and [[Unarmed]] attacks. If an affected weapon or attack is [[Magical]] and already has the maximum number of property runes, the wielder can choose one to suppress to gain ghost touch. This benefit lasts for 5 minutes or until the shutters are closed, whichever comes first. It applies to a creature only while it's in the lantern's bright light, and if the creature leaves the light and returns it regains the benefit once more.
