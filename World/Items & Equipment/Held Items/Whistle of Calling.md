# Whistle of Calling

**Item 15**

> A *whistle of calling* appears to be a simple brass whistle. It changes slightly in appearance depending on the type of creature to which it's attuned, depicting small carvings of hooves, feather patterns, claws, or other appropriate motifs.

```ad-embed-ability

*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You blow the whistle and the creature to which it is attuned teleports instantly from as far as 1 mile away to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. The whistle has no effect if the attuned creature is dead, on another plane, or outside the range.
