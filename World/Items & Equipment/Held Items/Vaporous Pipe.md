# Vaporous Pipe

**Item 7**

> This hand-polished pipe is carved from oak and releases small wisps of smoke even when unlit. As long as you're holding a *vaporous pipe* , you don't take a circumstance penalty to Perception checks due to thick smoke, and you can't [[Suffocate]] from smoke and heated air (such as within a [[Wildfire]] ). As long as you are holding the pipe, you also gain resistance to fire equal to half your level.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You draw on the pipe and then blow a massive cloud of smoke that fills a 30-foot emanation that includes your space. All creatures within the smoke cloud are [[Concealed]] from each other and from creatures outside the smoke, though you can still see clearly within it. The smoke dissipates after 3 rounds, or after 1 round if subjected to a strong wind.
