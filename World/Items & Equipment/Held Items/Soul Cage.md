# Soul Cage

**Item 12**

> As you [[Craft]] your *soul cage* , you trap your soul within it, an integral part of the complicated process of becoming a [[Lich]]. When you're destroyed, your soul flees to the *soul cage* , which rebuilds your undead body over the course of 1d10 days.Afterward, you manifest next to the *soul cage* , fully healed and in a new body (lacking any equipment you had on your old body). Only destroying your *soul cage* can prevent you from returning. You choose the form of your *soul cage* when you Craft it. A few options include a miniature cage, a ring, an amulet, or a crown. Work with your GM to adjust the usage and Bulk as needed, though a *soul cage* is rarely more than light Bulk. The *soul cage* has Hardness 9 and 36 HP.If your *soul cage* is destroyed but you aren't, you can attempt to find your soul and trap it again, building a new *soul cage*. This is no trivial feat and often takes an entire adventure to accomplish. If you don't cage your soul again, you suffer a long decline as described on page 119.
**Craft Requirements**: You have [[Lich Dedication.]]
