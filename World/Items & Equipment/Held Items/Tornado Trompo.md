# Tornado Trompo

**Item 18**

> Various runes are carved along the entirety of this wooden top. Spinning the top requires wrapping a thick string around its base and pulling the string in a vigorous motion. Wrapping a string and pulling the string each require an Interact action. The top's magic is connected to the power of the wind, which becomes evident when placed on a surface as it hovers in place.

### envision, Interact
