# Compass of Transpositional Awareness

**Item 10**

> The silver face of this glass-encased compass is etched with dozens of esoteric symbols, obscure icons, and inscrutable abbreviations.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* concentrate, Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per minute;
**Effect**: You point the *compass of transpositional awareness* at an extant [[Teleportation]] effect (such as a magical portal) or the site of a teleportation effect that existed within the last 1 minute (such as the space where a creature just cast *[[Dimension Door]]* ). Attempt an [[Occultism]] check to determine to where the effect leads or led. The DC of this check is the effect's [[Counteract]] DC. On a success, you know roughly the destination of the teleportation effect (for example “the [[Plane Of Fire]],” “north,” or “Avistan”). On a critical success, you ascertain the exact destination within mere feet for local effects (such as *dimension door* ) or within a few miles for long-range effects (such as *[[Teleport]]*, *[[Plane Shift]]*, or interdimensional portals).

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }*; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You use the *compass of transpositional awareness* to triangulate your current coordinates and the coordinates of your intended destination using teleportation magic. For 1 minute, whenever you cast a [[Teleportation]] spell that has a range, increase that spell's range by 30 feet. If the spell normally has a range of touch, extend its range to 30 feet.
