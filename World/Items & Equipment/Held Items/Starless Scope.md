# Starless Scope

**Item 9**

> Even during the time of Thassilon, when the Order of the Starless Night still existed, *starless scopes* were uncommon. Today, this final scope might well be the last one to survive the passage of time.A *starless scope* is a handheld telescope crafted of silver and fine wood. When one peers at the sky through a *starless scope* , one always views the sky as if during a clear night. A starless scope adds a +2 item bonus to [[Astronomy Lore]] and Perception checks made to observe the skies, as it causes all celestial objects to dim when not directly observed, allowing its user to more easily observe their intended subject. It also grants a +2 item bonus to all [[Occultism]] checks made to [[Identify Magic]].A starless scope also functions as a divine focus for worshipers of [[Desna]]. The magic of a starless scope requires a specially prepared lens to function, and it's possible to shatter the lens if you roll poorly when activating the *starless scope*.Without a functional lens, a *starless scope* doesn't function. You can replace a shattered lens with a functional lens by taking a two-action activity with the manipulate trait. If you know the formula for the starless scope, you can [[Craft]] a new lens with a DC 25 [[Crafting]] (master) check. A starless scope lens is a level 9 item worth 100 gp.

**Trigger**: you use the *starless scope* as a divine focus;
**Requirements**: you worship Desna;
**Effect**: You attempt to enhance the effects of a spell as you cast it by attempting a [[Religion]] check against the spell's DC, as determined by [[Table  10–5]] 

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* Interact ([[Abjuration]] [[Divine]]) 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You raise the scope to your eye and observe a creature within 30 feet. You can attempt to identify the creature by [[Recalling Knowledge]]. The *starless scope* adds a +2 item bonus to this check. If the creature is associated with the Dominion of the Black or the Elder Mythos, or is a creature whose actions have blasphemed against Desna (Ioseff Xarwin's ghost falls into this latter category), the creature must attempt a DC 27 Will save.
