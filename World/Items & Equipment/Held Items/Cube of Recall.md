# Cube of Recall

**Item 19**

> This small cube has smooth matte sides. One side is black, the opposite side is white, and the other four are various shades of gray. Each side can be attuned to a location and then teleport you back to that spot in the blink of an eye.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬½{.Pathfinder }* command, envision, Interact ([[Teleportation]]) 
**Effect**: While speaking a word of command and bringing the location into your mind, you push the corresponding side of the cube. You teleport to the location attuned to the side you press, within 100 feet of the attuned location, as long as that location is on the same planet. If it's not, your activation produces no effect, but the attunement remains.

```
