# Codebreaker's Parchment

**Item 3+**

> This finely crafted, seemingly mundane parchment is useful for writing sensitive documents. When words are written on this parchment, they instantly scramble into unrecognizable script, requiring a DC 20 check to [[Rules/Skills/Decipher Writing]].

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Effect**: The scrambled words align into the originally written script. Identifying the parchment reveals that it can be activated with a command, but a critical success to [[Identify Magic]] is needed to learn the command word.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Effect**: You light the parchment on fire, burning the words off while leaving the parchment unharmed and ready to bear more text.

```
