# Rime Jar

**Item 10**

> Magical reagents slosh inside this rime-frosted pottery jar the size of a human head. Despite appearing to be rimed in hoarfrost, the jar is warm to the touch. Ilverani wizards create *rime jars* to sustain themselves during the coldest winter nights.

**Effect**: The jar draws off the cold and warms your body. If you have the [[Fatigued]] condition caused by exposure to [[Environmental Cold]], it removes the condition. For 8 hours after applying the rime, you treat extreme cold as severe cold.
