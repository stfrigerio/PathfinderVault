# Rhythm Bone

**Item 1+**

> This small, enchanted bone (most often a jaw) is usually capped with metal at its ends. It's activated by striking it against a hard surface.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Effect**: The bone begins recording the next 1 minute of ambient sounds (including speech) that require a DC 15 or lower Perception check to hear. The bone's recording doesn't copy magical [[Auditory]] effects, such as those of spellcasting, a [[Harpy'S]] song, or a [[Banshee'S]] wail. Once the *rhythm bone* has been activated in this way, it retains the recorded sound for the rest of its existence and can't be activated this way again.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Effect**: The bone replays its recorded sounds.
