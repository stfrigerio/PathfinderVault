# Encompassing Lockpick

**Item 8**

> This lockpick houses a small compartment containing many smaller picks and other miniature tools. The lockpick itself is surprisingly malleable, belying the components within. An almost-impossible number of other tools are hidden in the compartment, including an entire set of [[Infiltrator Thieves' Tools]] and any replacement picks, an [[Elite Disguise Kit]] and any replacement cosmetics, and an [[Extreme Climber'S Kit]], all while still somehow remaining only light Bulk. This makes the *encompassing lockpick* a favorite discreet option for rogues infiltrating high society events, as formal wear generally has few pockets and only allows a character to wear a single tool kit of light Bulk.
