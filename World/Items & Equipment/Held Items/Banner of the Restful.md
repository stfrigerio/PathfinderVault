# Banner of the Restful

**Item 9**

> Carried by knights who expect to spend the night in the open, this simple-looking banner is accompanied by a long cross pole from which it hangs. Usually, the banner appears to be a piece of plain cloth; when activated, it automatically adopts whatever insignia the person activating it desires.
**Activate**: 10 minutes (command, envision, Interact);
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You plant the banner firmly in the ground, and a comfortable environment is created around it in a 20-foot radius. Those within the area are shielded against your choice of hot or cold temperatures, gaining the effects of 1st-level *[[Endure Elements]]*. The area created by the banner lasts for 8 hours or until it is removed from the ground.As part of the activation, you can choose to ward the same area with an *[[Alarm]]* spell. In addition to a mental alert for the person who Activates the banner, the alert sent by the alarm spell also includes an audible alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell, which has the [[Auditory]] trait. You choose the password as you decide to ward the area.
