# Alluring Scarf

**Item 8+**

> This thin, multicolored scarf shifts between hues in almost dizzying patterns.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* Interact ([[Emotion]] [[Enchantment]] [[Mental]] [[Visual]]) 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You Stride. All creatures within 10 feet of you when you started the Stride must attempt a DC 24 Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes [[Fascinated]] and must spend at least one of its actions on its next turn to move toward you. A fascinated creature can attempt another Will save if you move more than 30 feet away from them, and as normal, acting hostile to a creature or its allies breaks fascination automatically. Creatures that critically failed their save don't receive further saves if you move more than 30 feet away, and acting [[Hostile]] to such a creature's allies allows them to attempt another save, rather than automatically ending the fascination. You can Sustain the Activation for up to 1 minute.
