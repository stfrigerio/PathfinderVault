# Flask of Fellowship

**Item 2**

> This is a metal drinking flask, 4 inches in diameter and 10 inches tall. Its screw top is covered by four simple metal cups that nest together.
**Activate**: Make an Impression;
**Effect**: If you share drinks from a *flask of fellowship* as part of your Make an Impression action, the drink that pours from the flask happens to be exactly what the target of your efforts would most like to have a dram or two of—wine, spirits, hot ginger tea, or ice cold water with lemon, for example. You gain a +1 item bonus on your [[Diplomacy]] check.The GM can disallow the flask's use if it doesn't make sense in the moment for you to pull out a flask and start pouring, if drinks are inappropriate for the occasion, or if your target is absolutely not interested in sharing a drink with you. Drinks from the *flask of fellowship* are entirely social; they won't intoxicate anyone, nor alleviate serious thirst.
