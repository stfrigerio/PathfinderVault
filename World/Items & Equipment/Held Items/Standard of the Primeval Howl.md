# Standard of the Primeval Howl

**Item 10**

> These standards are always constructed from uncut wood and a leather banner painted with the visage of a snarling beast—a wolf, boar, bear, lion, dragon, or similarly imposing creature. And while it might become lost on a battlefield scattered with gaudier standards, its effect bolsters those around a competent leader. When carrying this banner, you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Intimidation]] checks and initiative rolls, and creatures in a 20-foot emanation also gain a +1 item bonus to initiative checks.

```ad-embed-ability

**Requirements**: You have the [[Battle Cry]] skill feat;
**Effect**: You attempt to [[Demoralize]] the foe the Strike hit.
