# Jar of Shifting Sands

**Item 7**

> This small, ceramic jar is full, holding approximately a quarter gallon of sand. When poured out, the jar immediately begins to conjure more sand. It is said, however improbably, that this jar is responsible for creating at least one desert in the world.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact; 
**Effect**: You cause sand to pour out of the jar at a rate of 1 gallon per round. This doesn't end until the cap is placed back on the jar.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact; 
**Effect**: You quickly pour sand over an adjacent square, making it difficult terrain. You can't use either of the jar's activations for 1 minute.

```
