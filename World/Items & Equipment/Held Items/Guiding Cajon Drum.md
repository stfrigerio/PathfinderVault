# Guiding Cajon Drum

**Item 5**

> This wooden, box-shaped percussion instrument resonates with great power when struck. The drum is large enough that you can't play it while holding it. Instead, you sit on the drum and play it with both hands. Sitting on or standing up from the drum requires an action, which has the [[Move]] trait. You're [[Flat-Footed]] while sitting on the drum, but you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Performance]] checks to play the drum. The drum is loud and creatures within 100 feet of the drum can hear its music, regardless of the ambient noise, though it can't penetrate *[[Silence]]* and similar magical effects.

### Interact (auditory, emotion, enchantment, mental)
