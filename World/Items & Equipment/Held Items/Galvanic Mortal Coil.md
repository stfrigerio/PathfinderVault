# Galvanic Mortal Coil

**Item 10**

> This porous steel coil wraps around a shard of onyx, supplementing the closely guarded science of [[Galvaspheres]] with the magic of necromancy. When embedded in a body comprised of flesh, the blood and other fluids catalyze electrical pulses within the coil, activating the necromantic energies. In living creatures, this causes a dangerous surge that can damage the heart. In corpses, however, this can create a limited window of reanimation, with access to the corpse's final memories. *Galvanic mortal coils* are even rarer than other galvaspheres, and thought by most to be merely hypothetical.

*â¬½{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You drive the coil into a living creature that has 0 HP while attaching the other end to yourself, in order to damage their heart and possibly siphon their life force. The galvanic mortal coil casts *[[Death Knell]]* on the creature (DC 27).
