The lions can be called on only once per day, and they remain in lion form for no more than 1 hour.

## Wondrous Figurine (Jade Serpent)

**Item 7**

**Price**: 340 gpThis tiny statue first appears to be a formless lump of jade until closer inspection reveals it to be a serpentine body curled into a snug knot.

## Wondrous Figurine (Marble Elephant)

The elephant can be called upon no more than four times per month. It remains for 24 hours as long as it is being used as a beast of burden or for transport. If it attempts an attack or otherwise engages in combat, it reverts to statuette form after 1d4 rounds.

## Wondrous Figurine (Obsidian Steed)

**Item 15**

Uncommon

**Price**: 6,000 gpThis sinister-looking black statuette resembles a horse rearing up on its hind legs. When activated, this figurine becomes a [[Nightmare]]. It can be called upon once per week for up to 24 hours, though it won't use *[[Plane Shift]]* or its other abilities on behalf of its rider. Although evil, it allows itself to be ridden by creatures of any alignment, although if a good creature mounts it, the rider must attempt a DC 3 flat check. On a failure, the nightmare uses *plane shift* to take the rider to a random location in the [[Abyss]], where it promptly returns to statue form, stranding its rider in that nightmarish place.

## Wondrous Figurine (Onyx Dog)

**Item 2**

The bear remains balanced upon its rubber ball, and is therefore ungainly: it cannot [[Climb]] or [[Swim]], has a –10- foot circumstance penalty to its Speed, and is always [[Flat-Footed]]. If the bear leaves its ball, such as if it is repositioned with [[Forced Movement]] or knocked [[Prone]], it immediately reverts to statuette form.

Creatures that come within 5 feet of a bismuth leopard or that end their turn within 5 feet of a bismuth leopard become [[Dazzled]] for 1 round unless they succeed at a DC 24 Will save. A creature that comes within 5 feet of both leopards or ends its turn within 5 feet of both leopards need only attempt one saving throw each time. The leopards can be called on only once per day, and they remain in their leopard form for up to 10 minutes. If either of the leopards is slain, that leopard can't be summoned again until 1 week has passed, but this doesn't prevent you from summoning the other leopard.
