# Galvanic Chew

**Item 8**

> A galvanic chew is a processed ball of dried [[Electric Eel]], roasted until chewy and coated in spicy, reagent-infused powder that tingles with electricity as you chew. For up to 1 hour, you have resistance 5 to electricity.
**Secondary Effect**: 
( [[Electricity]] )
**Trigger**: You're hit by a melee attack or touched by a creature;
**Effect**: You channel electricity into the triggering creature, which must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be [[Stunned 1]] (or stunned 2 on a critical failure). The chew becomes inert. You're then temporarily immune to galvanic chews for 24 hours or until the next time you make your daily preparations.
