# Origin Unguent

**Item 2**

> This shimmering, violet unguent forms mild chemical bonds between objects with a matching composition. You apply the adhesive to two objects, or to an object and a creature. You can check if the two share an origin (such as if they were broken from the same whole, or if a poison sample or body part came from the same creature) by holding them together with the unguent between; if they match, the unguent becomes sticky.
