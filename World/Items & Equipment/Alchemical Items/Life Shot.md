# Life Shot

**Item 2+**

> Life shot is a special cartridge that carries a small dose of [[Elixir Of Life]]. A creature hit by activated life shot takes no damage from the successful attack, instead receiving healing and gaining an item bonus to saving throws against [[Diseases]] and [[Poisons]] for 1 minute. On a critical hit, roll the healing received twice and take the better result (this is a [[Fortune]] effect). A target willing to be hit by this attack is [[Flat-Footed]] against it.
