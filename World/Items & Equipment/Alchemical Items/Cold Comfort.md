# Cold Comfort

**Item 7+**

> The contraption called cold comfort is a watertight pouch filled with a handful of small, heavy, silvery pellets. When emptied into an adjacent body of water, the pellets freeze the water's surface almost instantly, creating an ice block in a 10-foot square to a depth of 1 foot. Any creatures inside this space must attempt a DC 23 Reflex save. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 cold damage and is [[Immobilized]] for 1 minute or until it [[Escapes]] (DC 20) or the ice is broken. The entire ice block has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits, [[Cold]] damage, and precision damage. The ice is strong enough to support one Large creature or up to four Medium or Small creatures. Traversing the slippery ice requires a successful DC 20 [[Acrobatics]] check to [[Balance]].
