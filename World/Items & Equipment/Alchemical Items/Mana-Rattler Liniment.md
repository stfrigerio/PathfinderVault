# Mana-Rattler Liniment

**Item 9**

> According to reports, as well as Emelett's own marketing pitches, this lotion is derived from rare mana rattlesnakes whose oils ward against poison and disease. When applied, you can attempt to [[Counteract]] a [[Poison]] or [[Disease]] effect currently afflicting you. The potion has a counteract level of 5 and a +15 modifier for the roll. You also acquire a serpentine appearance, growing fangs and scaly skin. For 1 hour, you gain a fangs [[Unarmed]] attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage plus 1 poison damage.
