# Liar's Demise

**Item 14**

> This thick green cream quickly seeps into victim's skin. In addition to causing painful swelling in the brain, *liar's demise* compels the victim to speak only the truth. While under the effect of *liar's demise* , the victim takes the listed poison damage and mental damage for any time they voluntarily and knowingly tell a lie, due to the poison's increased blood pressure to their brain. They take this damage once per round at most, even if they lie several times in rapid succession. The victim is aware of this effect and can choose to not answer or give only evasive, technically truthful, answers—this is a [[Mental]] effect.
**Saving Throw**: DC 34 Fortitude;
**Onset**: 1 minute;
**Maximum Duration**: 6 minutes;
**Stage 1**:  [[Stupefied 1]], 3d6 poison damage and 3d6 mental damage for lying (1 minute);
**Stage 2**: stupefied 2, 4d6 poison damage and 4d6 mental damage for lying (1 minute);
**Stage 3**: stupefied 3, 5d6 poison damage and 5d6 mental damage for lying, and the damage becomes a [[Death]] effect. If it reduces the victim to 0 Hit Points, the victim's head explodes, causing death (1 minute).
**Craft Requirements**: Supply one casting of *[[Zone Of Truth]]*.
