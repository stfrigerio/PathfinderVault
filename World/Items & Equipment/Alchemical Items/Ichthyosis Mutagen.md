# Ichthyosis Mutagen

**Item 5**

> After you drink this mutagen, your skin continually renews itself, thickening into large, scaly patches.
**Benefit**: For 1 minute, you gain fast healing 2 and automatically succeed at flat checks to recover from [[Persistent Bleed Damage]].
**Drawback**: Your thickened skin makes quick movement difficult, and your excess skin flakes off with the slightest movement. You take a –2 penalty to Reflex saves for 1 minute. Any creature attempting to [[Track]] you in the next 24 hours gains a +4 circumstance bonus to their check.
