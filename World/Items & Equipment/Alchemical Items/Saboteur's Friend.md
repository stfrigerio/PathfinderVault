# Saboteur's Friend

**Item 4**

> The euphemistically named saboteur's friend looks, smells, and tastes like an appetizing chocolate square. You lace the chocolate with reagents that induce a strong laxative effect. Saboteur's friend is useful for incapacitating rather than dealing lasting harm. Unlike some poisons, saboteur's friend can have its sickened condition reduced (but changing to a higher or lower stage after a save applies any sickened condition listed for that stage, as normal).
**Saving Throw**: DC 20 Fortitude;
**Onset**: 10 minutes;
**Maximum Duration**: 1 hour;
**Stage 1**:  [[Sickened 1]] (10 minutes);
**Stage 2**:  [[Enfeebled 1]] and sickened 2 (10 minutes);
**Stage 3**: enfeebled 1, [[Fatigued]], and sickened 3 (10 minutes)
