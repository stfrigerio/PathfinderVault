# Star Grenade

**Item 1+**

> These unusual gunpowder bombs, typically marked with a symbol of a four-pointed star on their outer surface, explode outward in the shape of a cross whenever they Strike a target. When you throw a star grenade, arrange two perpendicular 25-foot lines over the target, both centered on the target and moving straight through the target, not diagonally. Creatures other than the target within these two lines take [[Splash]] damage (typically 8 squares take splash damage for a Medium creature). Any effect that alters or adjusts the splash area's shape or size, like the alchemist feat [[Expanded Splash]], doesn't apply to star grenades.
