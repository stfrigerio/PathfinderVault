# Drowsy Sun Eye Drops

**Item 3**

> These drops are made from luminescent mushrooms and refined into eye drops, which simulates a creature's natural night vision. When you attempt a Perception check to Seek, you can draw and apply a dose of drowsy sun to your eyes as part of the same action, which grants you [[Darkvision]] to a range of 30 feet for 1 round. If you do, your Seek action gains the [[Manipulate]] trait, due to drawing and applying the eye drops.
