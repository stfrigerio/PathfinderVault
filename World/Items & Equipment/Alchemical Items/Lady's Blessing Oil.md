# Lady's Blessing Oil

**Item 1**

> Lady's blessing oil is favored by [[Pharasmin]] healers who ease the transitions of life. You can Activate the item as part of the same activity you use to Administer First Aid to stabilize a creature. If you use lady's blessing oil, the DC of the check to Administer First Aid is reduced to the creature's recovery roll DC, rather than 5 + the recovery roll DC. However, if you roll a failure on the check, you get a critical failure instead.
