# Lastwall Soup

**Item 1**

> Crimson Reclaimers make this rich, hearty soup using herbs that baffle the senses of the undead. A bowl of Lastwall soup is as nourishing as a full meal. In addition, for 1 hour after consuming a bowl of Lastwall soup, you gain a +2 item bonus to [[Stealth]] checks and DCs against undead.
