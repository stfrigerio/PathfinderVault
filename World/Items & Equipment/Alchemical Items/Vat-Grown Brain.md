# Vat-Grown Brain

**Item 10**

> A malformed, artificial brain pulses with alchemical life inside a nutrient-rich vat. When the vat-grown brain is activated, it attempts to [[Counteract]] one condition of your choice that was gained from an ability with the [[Mental]] trait, which it does by drawing the negative mental impressions into itself. However, the artificial brain is not robust, and the strain of the transfer quickly destroys it. The vat-grown brain has a counteract level of 5 and a +17 modifier on the roll.
