# Ghost Charge

**Item 1+**

> These spring-loaded metal canisters contain a mixture of chemicals and salts that drain and disintegrate nearby [[Undead]] creatures. A ghost charge deals the listed positive damage and splash damage, though as usual for positive damage, this damage harms only undead and creatures with [[Negative Healing]]. Ghost charges are designed to explode even on contact with a spiritual substance, making them ideal for damaging [[Incorporeal]] undead. A primary target that takes damage from a ghost charge becomes [[Enfeebled]] until the start of your next turn. Many types grant an item bonus to attack rolls.
