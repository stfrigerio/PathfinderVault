# Alchemist's Flamethrower

**Item 2**

> This long cylinder is topped by a pair of brass sockets and a collection of polished pipes and tubes. A total of two vials of [[Alchemist'S Fire]] must be loaded into the sockets at the base of the weapon and the tubes cleaned and primed. Properly loading the flamethrower in this way takes 1 minute. When the trigger on a loaded flamethrower is pulled, the alchemist's fire is siphoned into the rifle and shot out of the muzzle in a line of fire. The damage dealt by a flamethrower is determined by the strength of the weakest alchemist's fire loaded into the flamethrower.
