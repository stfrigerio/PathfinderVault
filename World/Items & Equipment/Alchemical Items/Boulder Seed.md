# Boulder Seed

**Item 12+**

> This bomb is made of volatile fluids that rapidly expand and harden when exposed to air. A boulder seed grants an item bonus to attack rolls and deals bludgeoning damage and bludgeoning splash damage, according to the bomb's type. When activated, the bomb fills a 5-foot cube with hardened foam, which has stats according to the bomb's type and which [[Pushes]] a primary target of a certain size or smaller occupying that space 5 feet away from you. On a critical hit, the target also falls [[Prone]]. The splash zone fills with rubble, creating difficult terrain. The “boulder” the bomb creates fails all saving throws and loses 1 Hardness per round, disintegrating into fine powder when the boulder's Hardness is reduced to 0. At that time, the difficult terrain the bomb created also disappears.
