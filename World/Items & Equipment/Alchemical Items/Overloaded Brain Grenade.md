# Overloaded Brain Grenade

**Item 10**

> It's possible for a desperate alchemist to rig the brain container of a defeated alchemical golem to create a volatile (if unusual) explosive. You throw the grenade up to 60 feet, and it explodes, dealing 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 mental damage in a 10-foot burst (DC 27 basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, a creature takes 2d6 persistent fire damage.
**Craft Requirements**: Supply a brain case harvested from [[Alchemical Golem]]
