# Blindpepper Tube

**Item 1**

> This single-use pacification device consists of finely ground hot pepper loaded into a sealed, blowgun-style tube with a one-way valve and a range of 5 feet. To use it, the wielder must tear open the tube's seal as an Interact action, then spend another action to blow the hot pepper into an adjacent creature's face. These actions don't have to be taken in the same round. The target must attempt a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid inhaling the pepper or getting it in their eyes. On a failed save, the creature is [[Blinded]] for 1 round and then [[Dazzled]] for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is blinded for 1 round, [[Sickened 1]], and dazzled until it removes the sickened condition.
