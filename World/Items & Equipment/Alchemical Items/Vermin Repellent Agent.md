# Vermin Repellent Agent

**Item 3+**

> This specialized cream serves as a repellent to stave off insects. The repellent also binds with a number of common insect venoms, dulling the potency and giving the wearer's immune system a boost to resist venoms. Once applied to your skin, the repellent grants you an item bonus to Fortitude saving throws against [[Poisons]] for 4 hours. In addition, any arthropods (insects, spiders, scorpions, crabs, and similar invertebrate animals) must attempt a Will save when attempting to attack you with a melee Strike, or with a [[Swarm]] attack such as the [[Spider Swarm'S]] swarming bites. The arthropod then becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.
**Critical Success**: The creature can act normally.
**Success**: The creature is [[Frightened 1]].
**Failure**: The creature is frightened 2.
**Critical Failure**: The creature is frightened 2 and [[Fleeing]].
