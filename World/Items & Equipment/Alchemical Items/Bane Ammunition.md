# Bane Ammunition

**Item 1+**

> Monster hunters favor bane ammunition that contains a capsule of reagents tailored to a particular type of creature— [[Aberration]], [[Animal]], [[Beast]], [[Dragon]], [[Fey]], [[Giant]], [[Ooze]], or both [[Fungus]] and [[Plant]]. Each type requires a different formula. When activated bane ammunition hits a target that has a trait matching the selected type, it takes [[Persistent Poison Damage]] in addition to the damage the attack normally deals.
