# Yarrow-Root Bandage

**Item 4**

> This root is often infused into bandages for life-threatening bleeding. Activating the item is part of the same activity you use to Administer First Aid to stop [[Bleeding]] on a creature who's also [[Dying]]. When you do, you can Administer First Aid to stop bleeding and dying as part of the same activity with only one [[Medicine]] check. However, the DC for the Medicine check is equal to the 5 + the higher of the two DCs to Administer First Aid.
