# Tallow Bomb

**Item 1+**

> A mixture of rendered animal fat and acids designed to ignite the fat when exposed to air, a tallow bomb creates a splash of burning oil that adheres to skin, clothes, and hair. A tallow bomb deals the listed fire damage, [[Persistent Fire Damage]], and splash damage. On a critical hit, a living creature taking persistent fire damage from a tallow bomb is [[Sickened 1]] from the stench of burning fat and can't reduce its sickened value below 1 while the persistent fire damage lasts. Many types of tallow bombs grant an item bonus to attack rolls.
