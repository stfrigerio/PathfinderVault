# Ghost Ampoule

**Item 4**

> A daub of ectoplasm twitches within this glass container, faintly glowing with ghostly light. When opened it forms the echo of a departed spirit, which looks like a Medium [[Bestiary/Ghost]]. You can throw the ampoule up to 30 feet when you Activate it. The ghost utters a final lament, forcing each living creature in a 15-foot emanation except you to attempt a DC 18 Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes [[Frightened 2]] (or frightened 3 on a critical failure).
**Craft Requirements**: Supply ectoplasmic residue from a destroyed ghost.
