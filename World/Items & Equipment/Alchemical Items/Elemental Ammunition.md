# Elemental Ammunition

**Item 1+**

> When activated, the reservoir of alchemical reagents in elemental ammunition atomizes on impact, dealing [[Persistent Acid, Cold, Electricity, Fire, Or Poison Damage]] to the target and splash damage in addition to the damage the attack normally deals. Each damage type requires a different formula, and the ammunition gains a trait matching the damage type.
