# Phantom Roll

**Item 4**

> A phantom roll contains vegetables, greens, and fine, clear noodles, all wrapped in transparent, edible starch paper and alchemically treated and laced with a tangy sauce. Upon eating the roll, you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Stealth]] checks you attempt during the [[Avoid Notice]] exploration activity. You can also Avoid Notice at full Speed or combine it with [[Investigate]] or [[Scout]] while moving at half Speed. These effects expire 24 hours after you eat the roll or when you make your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.
