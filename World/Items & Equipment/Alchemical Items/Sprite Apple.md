# Sprite Apple

**Item 3+**

> A sparkling candy coating covers a sprite apple. For 10 minutes after consuming a sprite apple, you shed [[Bright Light]] in a 20-foot emanation (and [[Dim Light]] for the next 20 feet). While shedding this light, you can't be [[Concealed]] if you're visible, and if you're [[Invisible]], you're concealed instead rather than being [[Undetected]]. The light matches the vibrant color of the apple's candy coating. Creatures in the bright light are subject to another effect, depending on the type of apple.
