# Spectral Nightshade

**Item 13**

> Belladonna cultivated in planes hazardous to living visitors, such as the [[Shadow Plane]] or the [[Boneyard]], grow with a strange, skeletal look to their branches. The leaves and berries of these extraplanar plants are partly incorporeal and significantly more toxic than [[Belladonna]] grown on the [[Material Plane]]. When imbued with spirit-twisting magic, *spectral nightshade* quickly drains away the victim's vitality and makes colors painfully bright and bewildering. *Spectral nightshade* doesn't affect creatures that have no spirit; if a possessing spirit inhabits a body that takes poison damage from spectral nightshade, the possessor takes an equal amount of force damage, even if the possessor can't be affected directly by poisons.
**Saving Throw**: DC 33 Fortitude;
**Onset**: 1 minute;
**Maximum Duration**: 6 minutes;
**Stage 1**: 10d6 poison damage and [[Dazzled]] (1 minute);
