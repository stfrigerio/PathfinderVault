# Silver Crescent

**Item 6+**

> A piquant tamarind and chili-lime flavor infuses a silver crescent, which was first created to aid those battling the [[Undead]]. For 1 hour, you shed cool, white light like a [[Torch]], and you gain an item bonus to saving throws against [[Olfactory]] effects according to the crescent's type. While shedding this light, you can't be [[Concealed]] if you're visible, and if you're [[Invisible]], you're concealed instead rather than being [[Undetected]].
**Secondary Effect**: 

**Effect**: A ray of light descends on a 5-foot square of your choice within 120 feet. Any creature in that space takes positive damage with a [[Basic]] Reflex save and is [[Dazzled]] until the end of its next turn on a failed save. This is treated as [[Silver]] for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like. The silver crescent becomes inert.
