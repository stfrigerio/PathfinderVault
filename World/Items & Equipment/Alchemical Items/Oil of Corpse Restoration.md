# Oil of Corpse Restoration

**Item 9**

> Adlet spiritual leaders create this thick purple gel so that the dead can temporarily assume their appearance in life during ancestral worship ceremonies. Spreading it over the bones of an [[Undead]] creature or a lifeless corpse causes the gel to congeal, forming a cosmetic layer that covers or restores any missing or compromised flesh until the body mimics its appearance in life. The dead creature's flesh looks healthy and whole. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus on [[Deception]] checks to look like a living creature. The gel does not restore life or Hit Points and the flesh quickly rots away 8 hours after application.
