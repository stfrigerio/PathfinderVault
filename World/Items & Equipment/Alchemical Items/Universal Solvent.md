# Universal Solvent

**Item 5+**

> Originally formulated as a means of dissolving sovereign glue, this powerful solvent can break almost any adhesive's grip. As universal solvent is particularly effective against [[Sovereign Glue]], it automatically dissolves sovereign glue. It attempts to [[Counteract]] any other adhesives, such as *[[Tanglefoot Bags]]*, with a counteract modifier depending on the type.
