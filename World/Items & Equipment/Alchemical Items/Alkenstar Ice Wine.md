# Alkenstar Ice Wine

**Item 5**

> This bottle of delicately sweet ice wine has the properties of [[Alcohol]]. Made exclusively from grapes frozen in the Mana Wastes' erratic surge storms, Alkenstar ice wine finds a ready market among Geb, though [[Undead]] are still immune to the drug's listed effects.The listed price is for a mediocre vintage, but finer vintages are higher level and commensurately more expensive.
