# Feyfoul

**Item 1+**

> To creatures other than fey, the scent of feyfoul seems to be a faint but non-obnoxious odor of cinnamon, but fey find that the stuff interferes with their ability to manipulate a creature's mind. Jubilost invented feyfoul accidentally while he was attempting to create a cologne that would enhance its wearer's appearance to make them seem more otherworldly, but to anyone that asks, the gnome alchemist quickly claims that he'd always intended to create an alchemical tool that provided protection from fey magic.A single dose of feyfoul spritzed on a person in the manner of perfume grants the wearer an item bonus to Will saving throws against [[Mental]] effects generated by [[Fey]] creatures.
