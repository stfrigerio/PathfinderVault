# Ambrosia of Undying Hope

**Item 19**

> This elixir is usually stored in a small metal flask or miniature stein. The dark liquid sparkles as if it were full of stars and is considered sacred to [[Cayden Cailean]] and to the cults of the Failed in Absalom. The next time you would die from damage within 8 hours after you drink the ambrosia, it prevents you from dying, you regain 20 Hit Points, the elixir's benefits end, and you become temporarily immune to the *ambrosia of undying hope* for 24 hours. The ambrosia can't protect you from [[Death]] effects or disintegration, but it can protect against almost any other form of death via damage. You can only be under the effect of a single *ambrosia of undying hope* at a time.
