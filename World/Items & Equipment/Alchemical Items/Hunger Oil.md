# Hunger Oil

**Item 11**

> Rendered from the fat of corporeal [[Undead]] creatures and infused with [[Ghoulish]] magic, this yellowish oil causes its victims to experience stabbing hunger pangs that only living flesh can abate. If the victim eats at least a mouthful of [[Humanoid]] flesh, it ignores the [[Enfeebled]] condition from *hunger oil* for 1 minute. Victims under the effect of *hunger oil* regain only half as many Hit Points from healing effects unless they've eaten at least a mouthful of humanoid flesh in the last minute.
**Saving Throw**: DC 30 Fortitude;
**Onset**: 1 minute;
**Maximum Duration**: 6 minutes;
**Stage 1**: enfeebled 2 (1 minute);
**Stage 2**: enfeebled 3 (1 minute);
**Stage 3**: enfeebled 4 (1d4 minutes)
**Craft Requirements**: Supply one casting of *[[Ghoulish Cravings]]*
