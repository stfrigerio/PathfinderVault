# Daylight Vapor

**Item 13**

> This heavier-than-air mist emits a soft glow. While this poison lasts, it causes its victims to shine from within with agonizing, brilliant radiance. This effect has the [[Light]] trait (although the poison itself doesn't, so only the light effect can be [[Counteracted]] by [[Darkness]] effects). The [[Sickened]] condition from *daylight vapor* can't be removed while the poison lasts, and when the victim enters an area of magical darkness, the poison attempts to counteract the darkness with a counteract modifier of +21. If the poison fails, it can't attempt to counteract the same darkness again.
**Saving Throw**: DC 31 Fortitude;
**Onset**: 1 round;
**Maximum Duration**: 6 rounds;
**Stage 1**: 4d6 poison damage and sickened 1 (1 round);
**Stage 2**: 6d6 poison damage and sickened 2 (1 round);
**Stage 3**: 10d6 damage and sickened 3 (1 round)
**Craft Requirements**: Supply one casting of *[[Sunburst]]*.
