# Pucker Pickle

**Item 5**

> Sharp and pungent, but tasty, pucker pickles were created by [[Goblin]] [[Alchemists]] working to avoid being eaten by larger creatures. For 1 hour after eating a pucker pickle, you smell slightly of pickle, but you have a horrendous taste. Once a creature hits you with a Strike using an attack that allows it to taste you, such as a jaws Strike, it takes a –2 circumstance penalty to further attacks against you that allow it to taste you, including attacks like [[Grappling]] or [[Tripping]] you using its jaws or [[Swallowing You Whole]]. Creatures, especially [[Animals]], often choose other targets after tasting you. Any creature that [[Engulfs]] you or Swallows you Whole is [[Sickened 1]]. If it spends an action retching to reduce the sickened condition, you can attempt to [[Escape]] as a reaction.
