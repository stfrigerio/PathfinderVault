# Scarlet Mist

**Item 8**

> Derived from a mixture of krooth venom and an agitating agent, scarlet mist causes bleeding that turns into a foaming mist. When a creature under the effects of scarlet mist takes [[Persistent Bleed Damage]] from the toxin, creatures within 5 feet take the [[Splash]] damage. The persistent damage can't be staunched until the poison's effects end. A creature that can't bleed doesn't take the bleed damage or cause the splash damage but can still take the poison damage.
**Saving Throw**: DC 25 Fortitude;
**Maximum Duration**: 6 rounds;
**Stage 1**: 3d6 poison damage, 1d4 persistent bleed damage, and 1 poison splash damage (1 round);
**Stage 2**: 3d6 poison damage, 2d4 persistent bleed damage, and 2 poison splash damage (1 round);
**Stage 3**: 3d6 poison damage, 3d4 persistent bleed damage, and 3 poison splash damage (1 round)
