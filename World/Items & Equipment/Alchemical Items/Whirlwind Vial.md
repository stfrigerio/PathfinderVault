# Whirlwind Vial

**Item 11**

> Opening this vial releases a mighty gust, forming into a fearsome Huge [[Elemental Hurricane]]. The elemental breathes a 30-foot cone of air. Each creature in the cone must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or be knocked away from the elemental. A creature knocked into a solid object stops moving and takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage.
**Critical Success**: The creature is unaffected.
**Success**: The creature is [[Pushed]] 10 feet.
**Failure**: The creature is pushed 20 feet.
**Critical Failure**: The creature is pushed 20 feet and knocked [[Prone]].
**Craft Requirements**: Supply magical residue from a slain elemental hurricane.
