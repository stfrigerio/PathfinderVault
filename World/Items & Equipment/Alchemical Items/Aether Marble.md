# Aether Marble

**Item 4+**

> Aether marbles create violent, lingering eddies of force that extend partially into unseen planes. When the bomb explodes, it deals the listed force damage and force [[Splash]] damage. Many aether marbles grant an item bonus to attack rolls.Surfaces in the splash area are filled with twisting eddies of force, which are difficult terrain for [[Incorporeal]] creatures but not for corporeal ones. The force eddies in a square disperse after an incorporeal creature enters the square.
