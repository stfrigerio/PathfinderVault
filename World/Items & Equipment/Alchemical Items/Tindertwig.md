# Tindertwig

**Item 1**

> An alchemical substance applied to one end of this tiny wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with [[Flint And Steel]]. You can ignite the tindertwig and touch it to a flammable object as part of the same Interact action.
