# False Death

**Item 5**

> Typically used to fake one’s death, this poison swiftly causes the imbiber to lose consciousness and suppresses vital signs. A creature examining the unconscious target must succeed at a [[Medicine]] check against the imbiber’s [[Deception]] DC + 4 to determine that the target is alive, and a critical success allows the examiner to determine that a toxin is causing the effect. The false death toxin has an extremely bitter taste (Perception DC 10 to detect), making it difficult to trick a creature into consuming the poison against its wishes.
**Saving Throw**: DC 18 Fortitude;
**Onset**: 10 minutes;
**Maximum Duration**: 5 days;
**Stage 1**:  [[Clumsy 2]] (1 round);
**Stage 2**:  [[Unconscious]] (1 hour);
**Stage 3**: unconscious (1 day)
