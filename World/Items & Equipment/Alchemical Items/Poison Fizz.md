# Poison Fizz

**Item 8+**

> Made from a special mixture of honey and alchemical reagents, poison fizz is a zesty, sweet rock candy that pops and crackles in your mouth. For 1 hour, you have an item bonus to saving throws against [[Poison]] and being [[Petrified]].
**Secondary Effect**: 
( [[Poison]] )
**Effect**: You bite the poison fizz to release its poisonous liquid center and spray green mist in a 15-foot cone. This deals poison damage with a [[Basic]] Reflex save. A creature that critically fails is also [[Blinded]] until the end of your next turn and is then temporarily immune to being blinded by poison fizz for 1 hour.
