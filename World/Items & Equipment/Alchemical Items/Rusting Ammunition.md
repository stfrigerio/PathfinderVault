# Rusting Ammunition

**Item 13+**

> Rusting ammunition is made using a [[Rust Monster'S]] saliva and, when activated, deals damage to objects or creatures primarily made of metal. The target takes [[Persistent Damage]] for a duration determined by the type of ammunition used. A creature that drops to 0 Hit Points while taking this persistent damage crumbles into fine powder; its gear remains. The ammunition's type determines the maximum amount of an object that's destroyed.
**Craft Requirements**: Supply the saliva of a rust monster.
