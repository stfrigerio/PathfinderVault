# Silvertongue Mutagen

**Item 1+**

> Your features become striking and your voice becomes musical and commanding, though facts and figures become hazy for you and emotion clouds your ability to reason.
**Benefit**: You gain an item bonus to [[Deception]], [[Diplomacy]], [[Intimidation]], and [[Performance]] checks. Your critical failures with any of these skills become failures instead.
**Drawback**: You take a –2 item penalty to [[Rules/Skills/Arcana]], [[Crafting]], [[Lore]], [[Occultism]], and [[Society]] checks. Choose one skill in which you are trained; for the duration, you become untrained in that skill. All your failures on checks to [[Recall Knowledge]] become critical failures.
