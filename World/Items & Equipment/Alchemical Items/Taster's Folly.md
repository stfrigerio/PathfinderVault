# Taster's Folly

**Item 4**

> Devised to bypass detection, a dose of taster's folly consists of two compounds that aren't mixed but placed in the contents of one meal. Each compound is harmless on its own. The DC to [[Recall Knowledge]] about this poison from one of its components is 23 and attempts to use magic to detect the unmixed components require a successful DC 23 [[Counteract]] check. The onset period begins only if a victim consumes both compounds during the same hour. If the two compounds mix prior to consumption, they become toxic and are detectable as such. The [[Sickened]] condition can't be ended until the poison's effects end.
**Saving Throw**: DC 21 Fortitude;
**Onset**: 10 minutes;
**Maximum Duration**: 6 minutes;
**Stage 1**: 2d4 poison damage (1 minute);
**Stage 2**: 3d4 poison damage and sickened 1 (1 minute);
**Stage 3**: 4d4 poison damage and sickened 1 (1 minute)
