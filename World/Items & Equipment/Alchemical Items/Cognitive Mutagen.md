# Cognitive Mutagen

**Item 1+**

> Your mind becomes clear and cognition flows freely, but physical matters seem ephemeral.
**Benefit**: You gain an item bonus to Arcana, Crafting, Lore, Occultism, and Society checks and all checks to Recall Knowledge. Your critical failures on Recall Knowledge checks become failures instead.
**Drawback**: You take a –2 penalty to weapon and unarmed attack rolls, Athletics checks, and Acrobatics checks. You can carry 2 less Bulk than normal before becoming encumbered, and the maximum Bulk you can carry is reduced by 4.
