# Kraken Bottle

**Item 18**

> Coiled tentacles make it all but impossible to see anything else inside this ampoule. When opened, a Gargantuan [[Kraken]] bursts forth, which can appear in water instead of on the ground. Its arms attempt to grasp up to four creatures with a reach of 60 feet. The kraken repositions grabbed creatures to a different space within its reach unless the target succeeds at a DC 38 Fortitude save.If the kraken is in water, it then releases a cloud of ink in an 80-foot emanation. This cloud has no effect outside of water. Creatures inside the cloud are [[Undetected]], can't use their sense of smell, and are exposed to kraken ink poison. The cloud dissipates after 1 minute.
**Kraken Ink**: ( [[Poison]] ) Krakens are immune to this poison.
**Saving Throw**: DC 39 Fortitude;
**Maximum Duration**: 10 rounds;
**Stage 1**: 3d6 poison damage and [[Sickened 1]] (1 round);
**Stage 2**: 4d6 poison damage and sickened 2 (1 round).
**Craft Requirements**: Supply the corpse of a kraken.
