# Grolna

**Item 1**

> This [[Caligni]] -made, murky-green drug supercharges a creature's olfactory senses at the expense of dulling their mind. Popular throughout the Darklands for its ability to transform normally dull scents and flavors into intense, euphoric experiences, grolna can also be a great aid to trackers who want to follow scent trails, turning ordinary humanoids into effective bloodhounds.Taking an additional dose of grolna while affected by the effects of stage 1 of a previous dose resets the duration of stage 1 and postpones the onset of stage 2 effects.
**Saving Throw**: DC 13 Fortitude;
**Onset**: 1 minute;
**Maximum Duration**: 8 hours;
**Stage 1**: gain [[Scent]] (imprecise) 30 feet, gain a +3 item bonus to [[Survival]] checks to follow tracks, and become [[Stupefied 1]] (1 hour);
**Stage 2**: stupefied 2 (6 hours)
