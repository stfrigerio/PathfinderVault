# Dwarven Daisy

**Item 1+**

> A dwarven daisy is a string of dozens of firecrackers that create tiny, loud explosions. The string ends with a short, wrapped fuse. Pulling off the wrapping in a quick motion lights the fuse and is done as part of the action to Strike. A dwarven daisy deals the listed fire damage and splash damage. A dwarven daisy also has a chance to [[Dazzle]] its target. A creature struck by a dwarven daisy must succeed at a Fortitude save or become dazzled for 1 round.
