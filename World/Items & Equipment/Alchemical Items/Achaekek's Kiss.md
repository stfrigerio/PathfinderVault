# Achaekek's Kiss

**Item 20**

> Kept as a closely guarded secret by the deadly members of the [[Red Mantis Assassins]], this poison is treated with reverence for its ability to end lives. If the victim dies while affected by this poison, its body decomposes to nothing in 1 minute, leaving only its gear behind. Non-magical preservation can't protect the tainted corpse. *[[Gentle Repose]]* works on the poisoned body only if cast as a 5th-level spell and the caster succeeds at a [[Counteract]] check against the poison's saving throw DC when casting the spell. Even if cast successfully, gentle repose only works as if it had been cast at 2nd level.
**Saving Throw**: DC 42 Fortitude;
**Maximum Duration**: 6 rounds;
**Stage 1**: 7d12 poison damage and [[Doomed 1]] (1 round);
**Stage 2**: 9d12 poison damage and doomed 2 (1 round)
**Stage 3**: 11d12 poison damage and doomed 3 (1 round)
