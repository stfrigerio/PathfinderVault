# Astringent Venom

**Item 12**

> This oily, dark-purple powder gives off the distinct odor of boiled leather. When delivered, the poison acts quickly to constrict the victim's blood flow to their extremities and turn their lungs into a soft jelly. A victim of astringent venom is recognizable by the frostbite-like hue of their hands as they lose circulation to their extremities, making it difficult for them to hold things. Each round at the beginning of their turn, a creature affected by astringent venom must succeed at a flat DC 5 check or drop one random item they're holding.
**Saving Throw**: DC 32 Fortitude;
**Onset**: 1 round;
**Maximum Duration**: 6 rounds;
**Stage 1**: 6d6 poison damage (1 round);
**Stage 2**: 8d6 poison damage (1 round);
**Stage 3**: 10d6 poison damage and [[Confused]] (1 round)
