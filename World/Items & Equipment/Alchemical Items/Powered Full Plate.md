# Powered Full Plate

**Item 7**

> Stasian actuators help the limbs of this [[World/Full plate]] move of their own accord, as long as they're supplied with power. A chamber in the chest plate can hold a single [[Bottled Lightning]], which takes 3 Interact actions to install. A loaded suit of powered full plate can be activated to lower the armor's Strength requirement by 1 plus the item bonus of the loaded bomb. The armor's normal penalties still apply, based on this altered Strength. However, add the bottled lightning's item bonus to your [[Athletics]] checks to [[Force Open]], [[High Jump]], [[Long Jump]], and [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Shove]]. These effects last for 10 minutes. The armor uses up the bottled lightning during the duration and can't be activated again until a new one is installed.
