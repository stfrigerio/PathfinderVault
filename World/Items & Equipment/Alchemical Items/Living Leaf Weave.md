# Living Leaf Weave

**Item 5**

> This suit of [[Leaf Weave Armor]] is specially modified to metabolize the alchemical accelerants in medicinal compounds. A special receptacle in the armor can hold an [[Elixir Of Life]], which takes 3 Interact actions to install. A loaded suit of living leaf weave can be activated to grow slithering vines from the armor, granting an item bonus to [[Athletics]] checks to [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Grapple]], to your Fortitude DC to resist Grapple, [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Disarm]], or [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Shove]] attempts, and to your Reflex DCs to resist [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Trip]] attempts. The effects last for 3 rounds, consuming the elixir of life, and once the reaction has begun it can't be deactivated.
