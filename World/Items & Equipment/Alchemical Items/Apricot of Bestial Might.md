# Apricot of Bestial Might

**Item 16**

> This yellow fruit's soft flesh is covered by waxy, fibrous leaves reminiscent of a pineapple. When you eat an apricot of bestial might, you transform into a boar-faced battle form with scaly skin. You can use feats with this item as if it were a [[Bestial Mutagen]], improving your tusk unarmed attack as if it were a claw or jaws attack.
**Benefit**: You gain 8 resistance to all physical damage and gain a tusk unarmed attack with the [[Deadly D12]] trait that deals 1d10 piercing damage.
**Drawback**: You become [[Clumsy 1]]. If you perform an action with the [[Auditory]] or [[Linguistic]] traits, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost.
