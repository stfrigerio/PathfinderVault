# Lethargy Poison

**Item 2**

> Lethargy poison is commonly used in hit-and-run tactics by [[Drow]] and others who want their victims alive; the ambusher retreats until the poison sets in and the victim falls unconscious. Further exposure to lethargy poison does not require the target to attempt additional saving throws; only failing an saving throw against an ongoing exposure can progress its stage.
**Saving Throw**: DC 18 Fortitude;
**Maximum Duration**: 4 hours;
**Stage 1**:  [[Slowed 1]] (1 round);
**Stage 2**: slowed 1 (1 minute);
**Stage 3**:  [[Unconscious]] with no Perception check to wake up (1 round);
**Stage 4**: unconscious with no Perception check to wake up (1d4 hours).
