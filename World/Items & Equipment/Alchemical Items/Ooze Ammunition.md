# Ooze Ammunition

**Item 2+**

> Ooze ammunition is a capsule containing a sticky substance. If you hit a creature with activated ooze ammunition, it deals acid damage instead of its normal damage type, and the creature then takes the listed penalty to Speed and [[Persistent Acid Damage]] until it ends the effects. On a critical hit, the creature is [[Immobilized]] for 1 round in addition to the other effects. The target can end the effects by [[Escaping]] the sticky foam. Other creatures can provide the actions, although doing so deals half the ammunition's persistent acid damage to the assisting creature. A creature that ends the effect still takes the persistent damage that turn.
