# Quickmelt Slick

**Item 2+**

> This clay jar is filled with a warm fluid composed primarily of [[Lagofir]] oil and natural fire retardants. You can pour the fluid in an empty area adjacent to you, or over an adjacent frozen object, with an Interact action. The fluid instantly melts non-magical ice and snow in the area and harmlessly vaporizes the resulting meltwater. When used to melt magical ice and snow, quickmelt slick attempts a [[Counteract]] check with the listed counteract modifier to melt the ice and snow, using the source of that ice and snow to determine the counteract level and DC.
