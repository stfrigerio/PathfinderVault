# Jyoti's Feather

**Item 10+**

> A *jyoti's feather* is a shimmering red and gold feather, seeming almost metallic, although delicate and flexible to the touch. Though most aren't made from true [[Jyoti]] feathers, as the reclusive outsiders avoid visitors from the [[Material Plane]], their connection to positive energy lent the spellhearts their name.
