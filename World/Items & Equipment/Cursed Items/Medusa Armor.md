# Medusa Armor

**Item 14**

> This *+2 [[Adamantine]] [[Scale Mail]]* appears to have a *[[Fortification]]* rune but grants none of its effects. Whenever you are critically hit, after taking damage, you become [[Petrified]] for 1 round. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the armor fuses to you.
