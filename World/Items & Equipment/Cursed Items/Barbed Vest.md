# Barbed Vest

**Item 10**

> Viciously sharp spiked chains wrap around this [[Studded Leather Armor]] that can be used to magically harm the wearer and channel supernatural abilities without somehow tearing at the leather itself.The *barbed vest* doesn't fuse to you in the usual way (see [[Cursed Items]] ). It can be removed and discarded, but 1 day after doing so, you feel driven to recollect the vest at any cost until the curse is removed with a *[[Remove Curse]]* spell.Anytime you activate the *barbed vest* , its chains tighten around you, dealing 1d6 [[Persistent Piercing Damage]]. You can remove this persistent damage as normal, but only after deactivating the item's magic as a single action.
