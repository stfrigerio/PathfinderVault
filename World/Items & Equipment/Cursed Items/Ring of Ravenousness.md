# Ring of Ravenousness

**Item 7**

> Carved of acacia wood, a *ring of ravenousness* is inlaid with a geometric pattern. The ring appears to be a *[[Ring Of Sustenance]]*. Once you invest it, though, it fuses to you, its effects activating immediately. While wearing the ring, you require twice the normal amount of food and drink for a creature your size to avoid [[Starvation And Thirst]].
