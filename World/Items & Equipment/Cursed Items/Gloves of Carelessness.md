# Gloves of Carelessness

**Item 7**

> These gloves appear and function as *[[Gloves Of Storing]]* but repel any item not stored in the gloves. When wearing them, whenever you Interact to draw or pick up an item, roll a DC 11 flat check. On a success, you do so as normal. On a failure, you instead fling the item 15 feet in a random direction. You can use a reaction to attempt a DC 23 Reflex save, causing the item to land at your feet instead if you succeed. Removing the stored item from the gloves does not trigger the itemâ€™s curse. The first time the curse activates, the gloves fuse to you.
