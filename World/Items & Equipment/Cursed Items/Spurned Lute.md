# Spurned Lute

**Item 5**

> Made of a deep-brown rosewood, a *spurned lute* is adorned with carved flowers. The lute appears to be and functions as a [[Virtuoso Instrument]]. (Other *spurned instruments* exist, but the lute is the least rare.) This lute has a jealous streak, demanding total loyalty from its “partner” musician. After you play the lute for the first time, it fuses to you. If you go a day without using it to [[Perform]], you become [[Stupefied 1]] until you next do so. After that, when you attempt a [[Performance]] check using an instrument other than the lute, you take a –4 circumstance penalty to do so, and you must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or become stupefied 1 for 1 minute.
