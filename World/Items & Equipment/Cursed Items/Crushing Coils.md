# Crushing Coils

**Item 5**

> Made from constrictor snakeskin, the strips of this *+1 [[Leather Armor]]* wrap around you like an anaconda might wrap around its victim. The first time you roll a 1 on any attack roll or check after donning the armor, it fuses with you and constricts. It constricts anytime you roll a 1 on any attack roll or check thereafter. When the armor constricts, you're [[Restrained]] for 1 round.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact; 
**Effect**: The armor wraps around you, allowing you to don it by the time the activation finishes.

```
