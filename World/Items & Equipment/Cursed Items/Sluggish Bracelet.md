# Sluggish Bracelet

**Item 3**

> A silver charm bracelet, a *sluggish bracelet* appears to be a *[[Bracelet Of Dashing]]*, granting you a +1 item bonus to [[Acrobatics]] checks. If the curse goes unrecognized, you think you can Activate it to gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed for 1 minute. Instead, its activation is as follows.

```ad-embed-ability

**Effect**: You take a –10-foot penalty to your Speed for 1 minute, and the bracelet fuses to you. Thereafter, it grants you no bonus to Acrobatics checks, and it imposes a –5-foot status penalty to your Speed.
