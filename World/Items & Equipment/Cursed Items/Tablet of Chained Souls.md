# Tablet of Chained Souls

**Item 8**

> Half-formed, unreadable runes drift across this weathered stone tablet, which resembles a tombstone too eroded to be legible. Created by a long-dead order of scholars dedicated to [[Pharasma]], the *tablet of chained souls* can be a powerful tool in laying uneasy spirits to rest, but its magic exacts a heavy cost.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* envision, Interact; 
**Effect**: You present the tablet to a [[Ghost]], or lay it on a haunted site. The tablet's words resolve into a cryptic but accurate clue about the unfinished business that keeps this spirit from rest. Upon reading the tablet's words, you are subject to a *[[Geas]]* that requires you to right that wrong and lay the ghost to rest. If you die without completing the task, you become a ghost, cursed to remain until another recovers the tablet and discharges your duty.
