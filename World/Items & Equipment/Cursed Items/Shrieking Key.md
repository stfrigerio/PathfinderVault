# Shrieking Key

**Item 5**

> A skull-topped metal shrieking key appears to be a *[[Skeleton Key]]*, useful in place of [[Thieves' Tools]] when attempting to [[Pick a Lock]]. A *shrieking key* has no activation, however. When you use it to Pick a Lock, the key emits a loud shriek audible for 500 feet despite ambient noise. Physical barriers still block or muffle the shriek as normal. You also take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to the [[Thievery]] check rather than enjoying a bonus. After you attempt such a check with the key the first time, it fuses to you, returning to your possession if discarded. To use another device to Pick a Lock, you must first succeed at a DC 20 Will save.
