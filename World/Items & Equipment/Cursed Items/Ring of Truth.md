# Ring of Truth

**Item 10**

> This ring appears to be a *[[Ring Of Lies]]*, but when invested, close investigation reveals angelic wings and divine creatures hidden on the face of the ring. When you invest the ring, you are rendered unable to tell a deliberate lie, in either speech or writing. If you attempt to omit the truth or phrase things truthfully but deceptively, roll a DC 11 flat check; on a failure, the ring itself blurts out the entire truth (as you believe it) as an answer. Keeping silent does not activate the ringâ€™s curse. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the ring fuses to you.
