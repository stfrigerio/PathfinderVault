# Draconic Toxin Bottle

**Item 7**

> This glass bottle appears to be a *[[Dragon'S Breath Potion]]* of a specific dragon type (usually red) but has been polluted, making it toxic to use.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Effect**: You drink from the bottle and must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or become [[Sickened 1]] (sickened 2 on a critical failure) and immediately vomit the potion directly onto yourself, taking damage as though you had failed a save against a standard *dragon's breath potion*. If you succeed at your Fortitude save, you become sickened 1 but otherwise are able to unleash a breath weapon as normal for a *dragon's breath potion* of the appropriate type.

```
