# Bellicose Dagger

**Item 7**

> The hilt of a *bellicose dagger* is etched with the word for “war” in various languages. Having absorbed the spirit of violence over the course of its existence, the weapon now craves bloodshed. A *bellicose dagger* is a *+1 [[Striking]] [[Wounding]] [[Dagger]]*. However, anytime you interact with creatures, no matter the context, you must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or else find you have, as a reaction, drawn the dagger.When you use the *bellicose dagger* as a weapon for the first time, it fuses to you. While it's in your possession, you take a –2 circumstance penalty to [[Diplomacy]] checks and skill checks to avoid fighting, such as [[Deception]] checks to trick your way out of a scuffle or [[Stealth]] checks to sneak past enemies.
