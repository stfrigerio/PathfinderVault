# Ghastly Cauldron

**Item 10**

> This black cooking pot can produce a feast fit for [[Undead]].

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬½{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Trigger**: once per day;
**Requirements**: The cauldron must be filled with water, herbs, bones, and raw meat, and kept at a boil for 1 hour;
**Effect**: As you stir the cauldron, its contents transform into 10 meals suitable for undead consumption. Each meal must be ladled from the cauldron individually as a 3-action activity and must be eaten within 1 hour of removal. An undead creature that consumes a meal from the cauldron regains 5d8 Hit Points and gains the benefits of 4th-level *[[Restoration]]* that you choose; living creatures who consume a meal from the cauldron take 5d8 negative damage (DC 27 [[Basic]] Fortitude save) instead. Any meals remaining in the cauldron 24 hours after activation become inedible slurry.

```
