# Bountiful Cauldron

**Item 9**

> This mid-sized, silver cauldron is a boon within areas where access to fresh food is limited, for it can be commanded to fill itself with hearty (and delicious) vegetable stew. It can also be put to a much greater use in the pursuit of crafting certain items. When used to Craft alchemical items, potions, or oils, a bountiful cauldron grants a +2 item bonus to the Crafting check.
