# Raven Band

**Item 3**

> This armband is woven from overlapping raven feathers, including one large feather from a [[Kadlaka]]. As long as you wear it, you understand what ravens are saying, but you can't speak to ravens unless you activate the *raven band*.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: When you stroke the kadlaka feather, the *raven band* gives you the effects of *[[Speak With Animals]]*, except that you can speak with and understand only birds, not other animals.

```
