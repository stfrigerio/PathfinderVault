# Smogger

**Item 9**

> Some mutants savor the acrid smog of Alkenstar and the Gunworks. A *smogger* recreates this pollution by sucking in clean air and spewing it back out as pungent smog.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* Interact ([[Poison]]) 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: The *smogger* creates a 10-foot-radius emanation of smog centered on you, which moves with you. You and other creatures in the smog are [[Concealed]] while inside the smog, and other creatures are concealed to you and other creatures in the smog. A strong wind doesn't disperse the smog but reduces it to a 5-foot-radius emanation. A creature that must breathe that begins its turn inside of the smog can choose to hold its breath as a free action for the round, but if it doesn't, it becomes [[Sickened 1]]. The *smogger* can maintain this effect for up to 1 minute, and the wearer of the smogger can Dismiss the effect.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* Interact ([[Poison]]) 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Requirements**: The *smogger's* above activation is in effect;
**Effect**: The smog created by the *smogger* thickens into a toxic element that burns the eyes, blisters flesh, and causes fits of coughing. All creatures in the smog cloud, including you, must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save—creatures that must breathe and aren't holding their breath take a –2 circumstance penalty to this save.
