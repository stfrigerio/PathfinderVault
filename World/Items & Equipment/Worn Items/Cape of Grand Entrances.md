# Cape of Grand Entrances

**Item 9**

> This regal blue cape is crafted from a hefty yet elegant velvet embroidered with ornate silver stars and dragons. Falling in a cascade of fabric, the cape rustles and flows in all the right ways and hangs upon your shoulders in a way that flatters your form and figure. You draw the eyes of those around you and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your [[Performance]] checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* envision, Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: With a flourish of your cape, you make a grand entrance that draws the attention of those around you. You cast *[[Enthrall]]* with a DC of 25. The spell gains the [[Visual]] trait and loses the [[Auditory]] trait. You Sustain the Spell by continuing to sweep the cape about.
