# Empathic Cords

**Item 8**

> These intracately braided lenghts of leather, twince, and ribbon can be worn around the neck. *Empathic cords* function only with the other cord in their pair and must be crafted together. If one cord becomes broken, the other dissolves in to non-magical dust. The Price listed above is for a pair of cords. The creatures wearing a pair of *empathic cords* can sense each other's feelings and communicate empathically, no matter how far away they are, as long as the creatures are on the same planet.
