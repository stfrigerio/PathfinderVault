# Warden's Signet

**Item 11**

> This symbol shows your dedication to the magic practiced by some [[Rangers]]. Most rangers wear it on an amulet, ring, or piercing. You gain a +2 item bonus to [[Nature]] checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â­“{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can use only to cast a ranger warden spell. When you use this Focus Point, the *warden's signet* also casts a 4th-level *[[Barkskin]]* spell on you. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.

```

**Craft Requirements**: You are a ranger with at least one warden spell.
