# Phantom Shroud

**Item 17**

> This pale blue cloak is wispy, thin, and cold to the touch. When worn, the cloak turns your hands pale and translucent, imbuing you with the dangerous touch of a [[Bestiary/Ghost]]. This effect doesn't impede the normal use of your hands. You also gain an [[Unarmed]] attack that deals 3d6 negative damage with the [[Agile]], [[Finesse]], and [[Magical]] traits. You gain the benefits of a *[[+2 Weapon Potency]]* rune with these unarmed attacks (granting a +2 item bonus to your attack rolls).
