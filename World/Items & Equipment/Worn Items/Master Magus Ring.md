# Master Magus Ring

**Item 11**

> Elegant jewelry such as the *master magus ring* adorns experienced [[Magi]]. Each ring has a significant metal and symbol to represent a particular hybrid study, such as a heavy iron ring with an icon of a mountain for [[Inexorable Iron]], or glittering silver with a shield-like emblem for [[Sparkling Targe]]. You gain a +2 item bonus to [[Rules/Skills/Arcana]] checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⭓{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can use only to cast a magus conflux spell. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⭓{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: The ring transports you and any items you're wearing and holding from your current space to an unoccupied space you can see within a range equal to your Speed. If this would bring another creature with you—even if you're carrying it in an [[Extradimensional]] container—the activation fails and is used.
