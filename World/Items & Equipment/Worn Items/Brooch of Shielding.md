# Brooch of Shielding

**Item 2**

> This piece of silver or gold jewelry is adorned with miniature images of kite shields and can be used to fasten a cloak or cape. The brooch automatically absorbs *[[Magic Missile]]* spells targeting you. A *brooch of shielding* can absorb 30 individual *magic missiles* before it melts and becomes useless. Sometimes when found, a *brooch of shielding* has already absorbed a number of missiles.
