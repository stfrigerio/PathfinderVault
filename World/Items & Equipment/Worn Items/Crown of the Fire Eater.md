# Crown of the Fire Eater

**Item 8+**

> A wreath of flames dances around the rim of this golden crown. You gain resistance 5 to [[Fire]].

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬²{.Pathfinder }* comman; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Trigger**: You take fire damage;
**Effect**: You absorb some of the flame that would harm you. Increase your fire resistance from the crown from 5 to 15. Just after taking any remaining fire damage, you regain a number of Hit Points equal to 15 or the fire damage dealt by the triggering attack before damage resistance, whichever is less.
