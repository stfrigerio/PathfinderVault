# Corpseward Pendant

**Item 5**

> A *corpseward pendant* is usually shaped like the skull of a humanoid or small animal.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You become undetectable to [[Undead]] creatures for 10 minutes. Undead can't see, hear, or smell you, or detect you with sensory capabilities such as [[Tremorsense]]. A creature can attempt a DC 18 Will saving throw to ignore this effect. If an undead has reason to believe that [[Undetected]] opponents are present, it can still attempt to [[Seek]] or Strike you. If you attempt to use a [[Positive]] spell to damage undead, use [[Command Undead]], touch or damage an undead creature, or attack any creature while warded in this manner, the pendant's effects immediately end. An undead creature who observes you in this manner or one who succeeds at the Will save is immune to the *corpseward pendant* for 24 hours.
