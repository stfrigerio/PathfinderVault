# Heedless Spurs

**Item 15**

> These wicked-looking spiked metal wheels fit around the ankles and jingle when the wearer walks, imposing a –1 item penalty on [[Stealth]] checks. If used as a weapon, they are treated as a [[Spiked Gauntlet]].

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per 10 minutes;
**Requirements**: You are riding a mount;
**Effect**: You kick both spurs into your mount's flank. Your mount takes 2d6 [[Persistent Bleed Damage]] and gains the [[Quickened]] condition for 1 minute or until the persistent bleed damage ends, whichever comes first. It can use the extra action only to Stride.

```
