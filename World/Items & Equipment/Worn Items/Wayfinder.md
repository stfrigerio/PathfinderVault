## Wayfinder

**Item 2**

Uncommon

PFS Note
 *All Pathfinders have access.* 
**Price**: 28 gp
**Usage**: wornThis compact compass repurposes ancient technology to draw fantastic powers from the mysterious magical items called *[[Aeon Stones]]*. It serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe. A *wayfinder* functions as a compass.An indentation in the middle of the *wayfinder* can hold a single *aeon stone*. Placing an *aeon stone* in this indentation provides you all the benefits of having the *aeon stone* orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. You invest a *wayfinder* and the *aeon stone* within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit. An invested *aeon stone* slotted in a *wayfinder* also grants its resonant power.If you have more than one *wayfinder* with an invested *aeon stone* on your person at a given time, destructive interference from their resonance prevents you from gaining benefits from any of them. You can still benefit from additional *aeon stones* orbiting your head, just not in *wayfinders*.
**Activate**: 
command;
**Effect**: The *wayfinder* is targeted by a 1st-level *[[Light]]* spell.

## Archaic Wayfinder

**Item 2**

Uncommon

PFS Note
 *All characters have access to the archaic wayfinder* 
**Price**: 30 gp
**Usage**: held in 1 hand
**Activate**: Cast a SpellAn *archaic wayfinder* functions as a compass and acts as a repository for one cantrip cast into it. To fill an *archaic wayfinder* , a spellcaster casts the chosen cantrip into the empty device, providing any necessary cost; the spell cannot be one that is normally cast as a free action or reaction. Activating an *archaic wayfinder* is the same as the casting for the relevant spell. Once it has been activated, it becomes empty again. An *archaic wayfinder* can hold an aeon stone and activate its resonant power. An *archaic wayfinder* counts against the limit of one *wayfinder* with a slotted resonant *[[Aeon Stone]]*.

The *bi-resonant wayfinder* and the two *aeon stones* count as two items toward your investiture limit.
