# Dread Blindfold

**Item 17**

> When tied over your eyes, this ragged strip of black linen gives you a +3 item bonus to Intimidation checks and darkvision. You can see through the blindfold, but only using darkvision.The first time a particular creature sees you in a day, it must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or be frightened 1. This is an emotion, fear, and mental effect, and your allies become immune to it after about a week.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â­“{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per minute;
**Trigger**: You damage a creature with a Strike;
**Effect**: Your target is gripped by intense fear. This has the effect of a DC 37 *[[Phantasmal Killer]]* spell, but it is an enchantment instead of an illusion. The creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.
