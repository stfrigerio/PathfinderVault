# Envisioning Mask

**Item 11**

> These strange masks consist of a thin stone hood and a shimmering purple veil reminiscent of the [[Pleroma Aeon]] who first gifted them to mortals in the hope that sharing the means of aeon communication would reduce the misunderstandings and conflicts among mortal civilizations. An *envisioning mask* covers your entire face, though it doesn't hinder your vision or other senses.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You lose the ability to produce language and instead communicate wordlessly through a series of psychic projections. This acts as [[Telepathy]] with a range of 100 feet, but it is understandable to all creatures regardless of whether they have a language. When communicating with non- [[Aeons]], however, your meaning is often vague and mysterious. This effect lasts for 10 minutes.
