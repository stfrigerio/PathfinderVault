# Dweomerweave Robe

**Item 2**

> This robe is made from dweomerweave, a magical fabric created by spinning minor illusions into the threads of [[Ether Spider]] silk. Dweomerweave is naturally hazy and translucent. It can take on the illusory appearances of other fabrics and garments, and *dweomerweave robes* are coveted by adventurers who want to travel light without compromising on fashion.
**Activate**: 1 minute (Interact);
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You gain the effects of a 1st-level *[[Illusory Disguise]]* except that the illusion only alters the appearance of the *dweomerweave robe* , changing it into another garment with an appearance of your choice. The spell persists until the next activation. You can Dismiss the activation.
