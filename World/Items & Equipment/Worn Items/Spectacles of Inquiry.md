You gain a +3 item bonus on Perception checks you make to use [[Sense Motive]] against that creature. This benefit lasts until you Activate the item again in this way.If you're an [[Investigator]], you can use this activation as part of the action you take to [[Devise A Stratagem]] or [[Pursue A Lead]], and you can do the latter even though you can't see the creature. You must choose the same creature you chose for Devise a Stratagem or Pursue a Lead.
