# Cloister Robe

**Item 9+**

> The most devoted, [[Cloistered Clerics]] wear a *cloister robe*. Decorations symbolic of a specific deity adorn the robe, and the robe's colors and the complexity of its construction fit the deity's outlook. The robe serves as a [[Religious Symbol]] of that deity, and it doesn't need to be wielded to provide that benefit.The robe is *+1 [[Resilient]] [[Explorer's Clothing]]* and grants a +1 item bonus to [[Religion]] checks. The robe doesn't grant any benefits to a wearer who doesn't worship the deity tied to the robe. In addition, when you cast a domain spell from one of the deity's domains, you gain resistance to damage from [[Divine]] spells until the end of your next turn. This resistance is equal to half the robe's level.
**Craft Requirements**: You are a [[Cleric]] who worships the deity tied to the robe.
