# Vaultbreaker's Harness

**Item 6**

> A *vaultbreaker's harness* has four pockets across the chest. The pockets contain a set of [[Infiltrator'S Thieves' Tools]], infiltrator picks, a [[Levered Crowbar]], and a [[Glass Cutter]]. These items are magically bound to the harness; if they are more than 1 foot away from you, they disappear, then reappear in the harness at the next sunset. [[Broken]] or destroyed items similarly reappear, restored, in their proper pockets at sunset.
