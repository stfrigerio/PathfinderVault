# Ring of Minor Arcana

**Item 5**

> This rose-gold ring is adorned in the center by a somewhat ominous-looking horned skull. This ring gives you the power to cast the following innate arcane cantrips any number of times each day: [[Detect Magic]], [[Mage Hand]], and [[Prestidigitation]]. Each is cast as a 1st-level spell. If you are an arcane spellcaster, these can instead be heightened to the level of your cantrips.
