# Drover's Band

**Item 7**

> This black leather wrist guard has a bright red gem on the inside of the wrist. Faint glyphs and words of domination in [[Infernal]] swim inside the gem. Your words become harsh and clipped when you have this magic item invested.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬½{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You exert your will over a [[Mindless]] creature within 30 feet. If the target is a mindless creature of 3rd level or lower, it must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If you are a [[Devil]], the target uses an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw.

```
