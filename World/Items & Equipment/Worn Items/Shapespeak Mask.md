# Shapespeak Mask

**Item 4**

> A *shapespeak mask* is carved into the shape of an animal, usually tailored to a species of beast that the user favors. While wearing this mask, you can speak when [[Polymorphed]] into an animal. The mask removes no other limitations, such as the inability to cast spells while transformed.
