# Ring of Stoneshifting

**Item 12**

> This simple iron ring is faceted with a bulbous geode lined with bright purple crystals. A *ring of stoneshifting* grants you the ability to ignore difficult terrain caused by rubble or uneven ground made of stone and earth.
**Activate**: 1 minute;
**Frequency**: three times per day;
**Requirements**: You are standing on at least 5 feet of earthen material (such as stone, soil, clay, or sand);
**Effect**: You sink into the ground and emerge at another location within 100 miles. This location must have an earthen surface at least 5 feet deep and you must be able to identify the location precisely by both its position relative to your starting position and its appearance or other identifying features. You canâ€™t carry [[Extradimensional]] spaces with you to the destination, and if you attempt to do so, the activation fails.
