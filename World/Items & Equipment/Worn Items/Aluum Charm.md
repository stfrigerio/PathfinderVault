# Aluum Charm

**Item 10**

> This ornate pendant of brass is adorned with a vibrant blue gemstone. An *aluum charm* grants control over a particular [[Aluum]] and lesser influence over other such constructs. As long as you wear an aluum’s linked *aluum charm* , that aluum follows your verbal commands, including somewhat nuanced orders like “subdue this target” or “strike anyone wearing a blue robe.”

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per round;
**Effect**: The charm grants you control over an [[Aluum]] you can see within 60 feet, with a level equal to or lower than the charm. This has the effect of *[[Dominate]]* and allows a DC 28 Will save. If the aluum is currently under the control of someone wearing its linked charm, it gets a result on its saving throw one degree higher than what it rolled. You can control only one aluum at a time using this activation, and controlling a new aluum ends the effect for one you had previously affected.
