# Ring of Maniacal Devices

**Item 11+**

> This ring seems like simple tarnished brass, but it enhances your curiosity about traps and devices of all kinds. You can use an Interact action to pull a set of [[Thieves’ Tools]] from the ring. These tools appear in your hand and fold back into the ring if they would leave your possession. They grant you a +2 item bonus to Thievery checks to Disable a Device and to Pick a Lock, and the ring’s insights grant you the same bonus to Crafting checks to Craft and Repair snares and traps.
**Activate**: 10 minutes (Interact);
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You create a 4th-level *[[Glyph Of Warding]]* containing *[[Fireball]]*. You can have only one *glyph of warding* from a *ring of maniacal devices* active at a time, even if you have multiple rings, and the spell ends if you lose your investiture in the ring.
