As many types of *dragon rune bracelet* exist as there are types of dragons, though bracelets associated with [[Uncommon]] or [[Rare]] dragons have the same rarity as the dragon.While wearing a *dragon rune bracelet* , you gain a +2 item bonus to [[Diplomacy]] checks while interacting with dragons of the same type as the bracelet's scale (such as [[Red Dragons]] or [[Cloud Dragons]] ). You also gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against [[Fear]] effects from any kind of dragon.
