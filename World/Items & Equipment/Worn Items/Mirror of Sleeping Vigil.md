# Mirror of Sleeping Vigil

**Item 7**

> This jeweled mirror grants you gain greater control over your dreaming self. While invested, you can watch over your sleeping body from the [[Dreamlands]], letting you see your own body and a 5-foot emanation around you, though you can't hear, smell, or use other senses from your dreaming self. You do not take the â€“4 status penalty to visual Perception checks in that area or gain the [[Blinded]] condition from being [[Unconscious]] against creatures in that area. As long as you fell asleep voluntarily and not from a [[Sleep]] effect, you can automatically wake up from sleep if there is visible activity around you.
