# Telekinetic Converter

**Item 12**

> Copper cables run from these thick leather gloves to nodes that attach to the wearer's temples, allowing a spellcaster to convert the magic they normally cast to pure psychic intention. When you Cast a Spell using the *telekinetic converters* , you substitute any verbal spellcasting components for mental components of simple thought, granting the [[Concentrate]] trait to the spell you're casting.
