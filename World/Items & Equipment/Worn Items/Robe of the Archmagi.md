# Robe of the Archmagi

**Item 15+**

> Embroidered with fine silver thread in ornate arcane patterns, these robes come in one of three colors depending on their attuned alignment. Good robes are gold, neutral robes are light blue, and evil robes are red. An [[Evil]] or [[Good]] robe gains the appropriate trait. The robes benefit only characters who can cast [[Arcane]] spells and whose alignment on the good-evil axis matches that of the robe. If your alignment does not match that of the robe, or you are not an arcane spellcaster, you are instead [[Stupefied 2]] while wearing a *robe of the archmagi*. This condition can't be removed in any way until you remove the robe.The robes are *+2 [[Greater Resilient]] [[Explorer's Clothing]]* , and they grant a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against arcane spells and resistance 5 to damage from arcane spells.
