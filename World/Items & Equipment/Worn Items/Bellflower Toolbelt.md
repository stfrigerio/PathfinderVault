# Bellflower Toolbelt

**Item 6**

> Different versions of the *bellflower toolbelt* are customized to appear to suit specific trades, so a belt used for carpentry would look different from a belt for baking.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* envision, Interact; 
**Effect**: You place an object of up to 1 Bulk into the belt, transforming that object into a tool befitting the trade for which the belt was created. Each object remains transformed until it has been removed from the belt for 24 hours or someone uses a single Interact action to return it to its normal form. If enough transformed items are in it, the belt can be used as [[Artisan'S Tools]] for that trade.

```
