# Winder's Ring

**Item 7**

> This ring contains dozens of minute, interlocking bronze gears that buzz incessantly. The ring grants you a +1 item bonus to all [[Crafting]] checks to construct or repair clockworks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: The *winder's ring* transforms into a [[Clockwork Spy]] that doesn't require winding and obeys your spoken commands for up to 1 hour. In this form, the *winder's ring* has the [[Minion]] trait. You can use this action again to return the clockwork spy to *winder's ring* form as long as you're adjacent to the clockwork spy. If the clockwork spy is slain, it reverts to its ring shape, and the *winder's ring* can't be activated again until 1 week has passed.
