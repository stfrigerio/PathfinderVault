# Ring of Discretion

**Item 1**

> A *ring of discretion* magically conceals any armor and sheathed weapons you're wearing by either turning them [[Invisible]] or creating the illusion of ordinary clothes. The ring doesn't change your appearance beyond concealing weapons and armor. As soon as you wield a weapon affected by the ring, the weapon becomes obvious to onlookers and is no longer affected until you sheathe the weapon for at least 1 minute. A creature can use the [[Seek]] action to examine you and [[Disbelieve]] this illusion (DC 15), and it can attempt to do so without using an action each time it hits you with an attack.
