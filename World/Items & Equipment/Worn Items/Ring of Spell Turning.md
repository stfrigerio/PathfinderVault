# Ring of Spell Turning

**Item 20**

> This golden ring has three diamonds set into its face.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬²{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Trigger**: You are targeted by a spell;
**Effect**: The ring replicates the effects of an 8th-level *[[Spell Turning]]* with a counteract modifier of +35, possibly causing the triggering spell to reflect back on its caster. The ring can reflect no more than 9 total levels of spells per day. If you activate the ring to reflect a spell that would exceed this limit, the attempt fails, but the attempted usage of the ring does not count toward the daily limit.

```
