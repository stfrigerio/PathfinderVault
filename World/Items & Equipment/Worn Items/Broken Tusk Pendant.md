# Broken Tusk Pendant

**Item 3+**

> The followers of the Broken Tusk have passed down their custom of crafting and gifting these small ivory necklaces for generations. They're typically made from mammoth tusk (though any type of ivory will do), and each is carved to resemble a particular kind of animal—usually a raven, a moose, an ox, or an otter. Because tradition dictates that Broken Tusk followers take ivory only from already-dead animals, *Broken Tusk pendants* are especially rare; if an individual loses their pendant, it might be years before they acquire the materials necessary to fashion a replacement. *Broken Tusk pendants* bear no magical powers if they are made for oneself; only gifted pendants have true magical properties.You wear a *Broken Tusk pendant* like jewelry or tie it to your clothing. A *Broken Tusk pendant* grants you a +1 item bonus to [[Nature]] checks; this bonus increases to +2 when you [[Command An Animal]] of the specific kind depicted by the pendant.
