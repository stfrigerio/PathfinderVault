# Manacles of Persuasion

**Item 3**

> These sturdy, [[Average Manacles]] are connected by a thick iron chain that is much heavier than its appearance suggests at a glance. Followers of [[Zon-Kuthon]] sometimes employ *manacles of persuasion* against captured enemies and spies. When the manacles are locked around an [[Immobilized]] creature’s wrists, they begin to sap the life out of the victim, dealing 2 negative damage per hour until the creature falls [[Unconscious]]. The effect is [[Nonlethal]], so the damage doesn’t cause the creature to become [[Dying]]. While the creature is unconscious, the manacles deal no damage and allow the creature to recover Hit Points normally to a maximum of 10 Hit Points, at which point the manacles begin to deal damage once more. The manacles have no effect on a creature that is not immobilized.
