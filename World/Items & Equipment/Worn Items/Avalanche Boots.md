# Avalanche Boots

**Item 17**

> While the insides of these boots are comfortable, fur-lined leather, the outsides are a jumble of slate plates, giving the impression of a rockslide. You gain a +3 item bonus to [[Athletics]] checks and a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Force Open]] and [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Shove]]. When you invest the boots, you either increase your Strength score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â­“{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Trigger**: You succeed or critically succeed with a Shove;
**Effect**: If the Shove was a success, you push your opponent up to 10 feet instead of 5 feet. If the Shove was a critical success, you push your opponent up to 20 feet, and you can then choose to knock them [[Prone]].

```
