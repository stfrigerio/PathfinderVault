# Skinsaw Mask

**Item 3**

> A patchwork of [[Humanoid]] flesh makes up a *skinsaw mask* , which is stitched together with black silk or wire. It is distinctive for its bulbous orange eye—crafted from a magical glass bauble—and wide row of teeth. When worn, the mask amplifies your ability to sense fear in other creatures. You know the value of the [[Frightened]] condition of any [[Observed]] creature, and you gain a +1 item bonus to Perception checks to [[Seek]] frightened creatures. Whenever you deal precision damage to a frightened creature, you deal 1 additional precision damage. If you aren't evil, you are [[Drained 2]] while wearing a *skinsaw mask*.
