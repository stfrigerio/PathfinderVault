# Hosteling Statuette

**Item 4**

> This soapstone statuette resembles an unidentified lump with a vaguely animal shape, worn on a band or cord around the companion's neck. When your companion invests the item, the statuette changes to appear as a miniature carved soapstone version of the companion.
