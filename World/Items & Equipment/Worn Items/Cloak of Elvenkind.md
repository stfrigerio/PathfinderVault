# Cloak of Elvenkind

**Item 7+**

> This cloak is deep green with a voluminous hood, embroidered with gold trim and symbols significant in elven culture. The cloak allows you to cast the *[[Ghost Sound]]* cantrip as an arcane innate spell. When you adjust the cloak’s clasp (an Interact action), the cloak transforms to match the environment around you and muffles your sounds, granting you a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks.

```ad-embed-ability

**Effect**: You draw the hood up and gain the effects of *[[Invisibility]]*, with the spell's normal duration or until you pull the hood back down, whichever comes first. If you're also wearing *[[Boots Of Elvenkind]]* , you can activate this ability twice per day.
