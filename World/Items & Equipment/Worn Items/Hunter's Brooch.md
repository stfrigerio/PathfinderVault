# Hunter's Brooch

**Item 4**

> While wearing this silver religious symbol of [[Erastil]], you can cast the *[[Disrupt Undead]]* cantrip as an innate divine spell.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬½{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: By touching a weapon you wield to the symbol and uttering a plea for Erastil's steadying hand, you grant that weapon the [[Deadly D12]] trait. Against [[Undead]], the weapon instead gains the [[Fatal D12]] trait. This blessing lasts for 1 minute, until you score a critical hit with the weapon, or until you aren't wielding the weapon.

```
