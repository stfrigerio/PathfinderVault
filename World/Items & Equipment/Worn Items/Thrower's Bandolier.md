# Thrower's Bandolier

**Item 3**

> This bandolier is covered in straps and pouches capable of holding up to 2 Bulk of one-handed [[Thrown]] weapons. A *thrower's bandolier* has a *[[+1 Weapon Potency]]* rune etched into it, and it can be etched with runes as though it were a one-handed thrown weapon. When you invest the *thrower's bandolier* , you can attune it to all the weapons sheathed in it (this ends any previous attunements made with the bandolier). Whenever you draw a weapon from the bandolier, the bandolier's runes are replicated onto that weapon. Any runes already on the weapon are suppressed, and any runes previously replicated to a different weapon in this way are removed, returning it to normal.
