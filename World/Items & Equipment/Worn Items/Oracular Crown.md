# Oracular Crown

**Item 11**

> Patterns themed to your curse cover your *oracular crown*. As your curse worsens, the appearance of the crown changes, introducing extreme angles, stronger colors, or other indications of the intensity of your curse. Similarly, it gets closer to its natural form when you reduce the effects of your curse. You gain a +2 item bonus to [[Religion]] checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⭓{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can use only to cast an oracle revelation spell. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* command ([[Healing]] [[Necromancy]] [[Positive]]) 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Requirements**: Your oracular curse is at its minor stage or higher;
**Effect**: You regain 3d8 Hit Points. This amount increases to 5d8 if your curse is at its moderate stage or 7d8 if it's at its major stage. If you have [[Negative Healing]], this activation has the [[Negative]] trait and not the healing and positive traits.
