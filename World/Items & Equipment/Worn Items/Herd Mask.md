# Herd Mask

**Item 6**

> All *herd masks* are linked to at least one other *herd mask* and are usually sold in sets of multiple masks. Linked *herd masks* look like one another, with only the slightest of differences to tell them apart.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You swap locations with another creature wearing a linked *herd mask* within 100 feet. If you and the creature you swapped with are disguised as each other, other creatures gain an immediate Perception check against the lower of your or the other wearer's [[Deception]] DCs to [[Impersonate]] each other. On a failure, they don't realize the swap occurred.

```

**Craft Requirements**: Supply a casting of *[[Dimension Door]]*. You can link a *herd mask* you create to another *herd mask* in your possession when you finish crafting it, which causes it to be linked to the chosen mask as well as all other *herd masks* that are also linked to the chosen mask.
