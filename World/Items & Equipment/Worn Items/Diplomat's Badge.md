# Diplomat's Badge

**Item 5**

> When displayed prominently, this brass badge makes creatures find you more agreeable. You gain a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Recall Knowledge; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: Attempt a DC 20 check to Recall Knowledge about people of a human ethnicity, a non-human ancestry, or some other type of creature. (The GM determines what your options are.) If you succeed, the badge’s bonus increases to +2 for Diplomacy checks with creatures of that group for the rest of the day.
