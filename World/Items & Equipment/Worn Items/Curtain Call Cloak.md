# Curtain Call Cloak

**Item 12**

> This blue velvet cloak is cut from the remains of a curtain from a destroyed theater. When worn, you gain a +2 item bonus to [[Performance]] checks while acting, orating, or singing, as the cloak makes minor motions to accentuate your performance.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You take a bow, spread your arms, and the cloak casts 4th-level [[Darkness]] centered on a corner of your space. This darkness doesn't impede your vision. While the darkness persists, it emits noise like the applauding of a moderately sized crowd.

```
