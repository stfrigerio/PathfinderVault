# Heartstone

**Item 9+**

> This gemstone grants its wearer a +2 item bonus to saving throws.Each *heartstone* is powered by the spirit of a specific night hag. If it’s separated from her for 24 hours (or she’s been dead for 24 hours), it becomes a nonmagical gemstone. A *heartstone* allows the hag to use additional occult innate spells: *[[Ethereal Jaunt]]* (9th level) and *[[Bind Soul]]* at will, and *[[Shadow Blast]]* twice per day.

Uncommon

**Price**: 2,500 gp ((1,000 gp when nonmagical))This pale gemstone grants its wearer a +2 item bonus to saving throws and the ability to discern a target's alignment (as *[[Detect Alignment]]*, but can detect chaotic, evil, good, and lawful auras simultaneously) at will by peering through the gemstone.Like all hag *heartstones* , this gemstone is powered by [[Skarja'S]] spirit. Skarja does not need to wear her *heartstone* to benefit from its powers, but she cannot use them if she hasn't touched her *heartstone* in the past 7 days. If Skarja's *heartstone* is separated from her for more than 7 days (or if she's been dead for 7 days), it becomes a non-magical gemstone. Skarja's *heartstone* allows her to use additional occult innate spells: *[[Ethereal Jaunt]]* (9th level) and *[[Bind Soul]]* at will, *[[Shadow Blast]]* (6th level) twice per day, and *[[Spirit Blast]]* once per day.
