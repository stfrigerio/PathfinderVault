# Hunter's Arrowhead

**Item 4**

> A *hunter's arrowhead* is meant to be worn as a charm, such as a pendant, or carried in a pocket or quiver. The arrowhead is etched with images sacred to the elven god [[Ketephys]]. While you wear or carry the arrowhead, it infuses you with great skill at hunting, and you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Survival]] checks and attack rolls against any creature you've currently designated as your prey with [[Hunt Prey]]. A *hunter's arrowhead* is also a [[Religious Symbol]] of Ketephys.
