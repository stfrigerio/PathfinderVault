# Stag's Helm

**Item 6**

> This impressive-looking helmet is crafted to resemble the skull of a mighty stag. Although made from bone, the antlers and helm are as strong as iron. While the Stag Lord himself wears this helmet in the Kingmaker Adventure Path, *stag's helms* are actually the creation of the church of [[Erastil]], and worshipers of this deity find that the helm is not only particularly comfortable to wear, but that they can activate it once per hour rather than once per day.Rather than restrict the senses, a *stag's helm* enhances them, causing the world to appear in more vibrant colors and significantly enhancing the ambient sounds of the region without making them distracting. While worn, it grants a +1 item bonus to Perception checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â­“{.Pathfinder }*; 
**Frequency**: once per day (or once per hour if the wearer worships Erastil);
**Effect**: Choose a single creature within 30 feet. The *stag's helm* focuses your aim and grants supernatural insight into your next shot. Your target is [[Flat-Footed]] to the next ranged Strike you make this turn against them.
