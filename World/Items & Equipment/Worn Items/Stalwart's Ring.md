# Stalwart's Ring

**Item 5**

> This fairly simple ring has no gemstone inlaid, but the band is cast to resembled a fanged wolfâ€™s head. Once per day, during your daily preparations, you can meditate on this ring to grant yourself 5 temporary Hit Points. These last until your next daily preparation, as long as you are wearing the ring.
