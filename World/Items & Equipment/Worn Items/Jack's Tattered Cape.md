# Jack's Tattered Cape

**Item 2**

> This ragged, mud-stained cape closes with a single black button engraved with a leering devil's face. When you [[Leap]], [[High Jump]], or [[Long Jump]] (or Vault, if you're [[Spring-Heeled Jack]] ), you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Stealth]] checks to [[Hide]] or [[Sneak]] until the start of your next turn.
