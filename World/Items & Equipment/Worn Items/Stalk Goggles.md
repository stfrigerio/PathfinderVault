# Stalk Goggles

**Item 1+**

> These black leather goggle frames have no lenses. Instead, when a character puts them on and invests them, the wearer's eyes transform and lengthen into snail-like eyestalks. The wobbly eyestalks stretch out through the lens holes and up over the wearer's head on lengthened optic nerves.
