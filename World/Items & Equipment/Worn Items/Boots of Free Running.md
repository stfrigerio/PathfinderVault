# Boots of Free Running

**Item 5+**

> These comfortable and practical boots slip on easily and fill you with boundless energy. The treads of these boots provide exceptional traction, with improved grip on surfaces you would traditionally have difficulty traversing. While wearing the boots, you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Acrobatics]] checks to [[Balance]] and to [[Athletics]] checks to [[High Jump]] and [[Long Jump]].

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: The traction of your boots improves, allowing you to run along vertical surfaces for 1 minute. When you Stride, you can run up solid vertical surfaces, like walls, at your full Speed. You must start your movement on a horizontal surface. If you end a Stride off the ground, you must Stride along the surface again until you reach a horizontal surface or you begin to fall (though you can [[Grab An Edge]], if applicable). If you have means of walking on water, such as with *[[Water Walk]]* or similar abilities, you can also run along flimsy vertical surfaces, as well as vertical liquids such as a waterfall.
