**Item 1**

> The crown of a *candlecap* is stitched leather sewn in the shape of a small bowl. Fixed inside the bowl is a melted nub of wax with a small black wick.

*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Effect**: You shake your head, and the candle wick ignites. The *candlecap* sheds [[Dim Light]] in a 20-foot radius. The candle doesn't require oxygen and can't be smothered or quenched. Activating the *candlecap* again douses the light.
