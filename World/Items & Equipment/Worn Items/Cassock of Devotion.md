# Cassock of Devotion

**Item 11**

> Each *cassock of devotion* depicts scenes related to the domains of a certain deity. It serves as a religious symbol of that deity, and it doesn’t need to be wielded to provide that benefit. You gain a +2 item bonus to Religion checks and a +1 item bonus to the divine skill of the deity to whom the cassock is dedicated.

```ad-embed-ability

*⭓{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can spend only to cast a cleric domain spell for a domain belonging to the deity the cassock is dedicated to. If you don’t spend this Focus Point by the end of this turn, it is lost.

```

**Craft Requirements**: You are a cleric who worships the deity tied to the cassock.
