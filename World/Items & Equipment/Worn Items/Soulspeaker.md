# Soulspeaker

**Item 2**

> This grotesque, amulet-like shrunken head is said to hold a shard of its owner's psyche. The head is often that of a [[Humanoid]], but any creature capable of speaking in life can provide the grisly component needed for this magic item's creation. The head can contain a short message whispered to it and can then be commanded to repeat the message later. While a *soulspeaker* carries a message, the eyes of the shrunken head open, and they close as soon as its message is delivered.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Effect**: You cast *[[Message]]*, but instead of your message being transferred directly to a target's ears, the message is stored in the *soulspeaker*. The *soulspeaker's* eyes open, and the next time it's activated, the *soulspeaker* repeats the message you spoke to it with a rasping whisper before its eyes close again, the message expended.

```
