# Aeon Stone

**Item 1+**

> Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an *aeon stone* with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.There are various types of *aeon stones* , each with a different shape, color, and magical effect. Each *aeon stone* also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a *[[Wayfinder]]*.

## Aeon Stone (Clear Spindle)

**Item 7**

**Price**: 325 gp

You don’t need to eat or drink while this *aeon stone* is invested by you. This *aeon stone* doesn’t function until it has been worn continuously for a week and invested each day therein. If it’s invested by someone else, this interval starts over.The resonant power allows you to cast *[[Air Bubble]]* as a primal innate spell once per day.

## Aeon Stone (Dull Gray)

**Item 1**

**Price**: 9 gp

A *dull gray aeon stone* has lost its special magical properties, sometimes as a result of overusing a *tourmaline sphere* or *pale lavender ellipsoid aeon stone*. It still orbits your head like any other *aeon stone* and can thus serve as a stylish, hands-free option for various spells that target an object, like *[[Continual Flame]]*. *Dull gray aeon stones* have no resonant power.

## Aeon Stone (Gold Nodule)

**Item 6**

**Price**: 230 gp

When a *gold nodule aeon stone* is created, its creator chooses a language they know to store within the crystal.

## Aeon Stone (Lavender and Green Ellipsoid)
