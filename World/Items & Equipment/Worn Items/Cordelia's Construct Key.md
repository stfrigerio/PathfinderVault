# Cordelia's Construct Key

**Item 8+**

> Worn on a necklace, this intricate key grants you greater facility with [[Constructs]]. The key alerts you to constructs lurking around you. Whether or not you are [[Investigating]], the GM automatically rolls [[Secret]] [[Recall Knowledge]] checks for you when you see a construct pretending to be a normal object, statue, or the like. Typically, this check is [[Rules/Skills/Arcana]], [[Crafting]], or an appropriate [[Lore]] skill. On a success, you recognize the presence of the construct and gain the usual benefits of Recall Knowledge.While you're wearing the key, if your attack reduces a construct to 0 Hit Points, instead of destroying it completely, you can send it into a dormant state, from which you can study its inner workings and possibly (at the GM's discretion) spend time and money to reprogram or repurpose it. Even if you don't subvert it, you can [[Repair]] a construct rendered dormant this way, allowing you to return tomb guardians to their vigil after you've battled them. Additionally, you can activate the key in two ways to call a construct to serve you.
