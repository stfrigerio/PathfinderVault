# Tactician's Helm

**Item 5**

> Repurposing and enchanting a helmet worn by a battlefield commander can create a *tactician's helm* , imparting knowledge of battlefield tactics that feeds off your minor victories. The helm grants you a +1 item bonus to [[Warfare Lore]] checks. Also, a jewel adorns the brow of the helmet. This jewel becomes charged each time you hit a creature with an [[Attack Of Opportunity]]. A *tactician's helm* can hold up to 2 charges, and its charges reset to 0 when you invest it.
