# Grim Ring

**Item 5**

> This golden ring is sculpted with the visage of a grinning skull on the side. While wearing the ring, you can attempt to detect the presence of [[Undead]] creatures as an [[Exploration]] activity. This reveals the presence or absence of undead in the area, but it doesn't pinpoint their locations. This ring can't detect undead whose appearance is masked by any [[Illusion]] spell that is 2nd level or higher. If an undead is hiding or disguised, the GM rolls a secret Perception check for you against the undead's [[Stealth]] or [[Deception]] DC, as appropriate, with a +2 item bonus to your check.

*â¬²{.Pathfinder }* envision ([[Positive]]) 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Trigger**: You gain the [[Drained]] condition from an undead creature;
**Effect**: Reduce the value of the drained condition you gain by 1, and the undead that caused the condition takes 2d6 positive damage.
