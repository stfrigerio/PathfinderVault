# Swarmform Collar

**Item 7**

> This sturdy leather collar is imprinted with tessellated animal shapes. When invested, the animal shapes change to match that of your companion.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* envision, Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You touch the collar and your companion splits into a swarm of hundreds of identical Tiny versions of itself for 1 minute. Its space becomes Large, it gains the weaknesses and resistances of a [[Spider Swarm]], and the [[Swarm]] trait, though it doesn't gain [[Swarm Mind]], as it's controlled by a single mind. Its unarmed attacks are replaced with a single-action swarming attack that deals 1d8 damage of the type normally inflicted by the companion's unarmed attacks to any foe in its space, with a DC 23 [[Basic]] Reflex save. While in swarm form, your companion can take the Support action but can't perform its advanced maneuver. Its other statistics don't change. If the companion is reduced to 0 Hit Points while in swarm form, the companion immediately recombines into its original form in an available space, in addition to the usual effects of being reduced to 0 Hit Points.
