# Thunder Helm

**Item 5**

> The creator of the original *thunder helm* tried and failed time and again to craft a reliable, helmet-mounted firearm that enabled hands-free gunplay, but even after resorting to magical enhancements, they were never quite able to realize their vision. The allure of the *thunder helm* continues to compel certain mindsets in the Mana Wastes, and these items continue to be crafted to this day.A *thunder helm* appears as a cylindrical iron helmet adorned with a crown-like display of gun barrels extending out in all directions. A slit in the front allows for limited visibility, while sound is muffled by the inner lining. As long as a creature wears a *thunder helm* , it takes a –1 circumstance penalty to [[Auditory]] and [[Visual]] Perception checks but also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against auditory and visual effects.

*⬺{.Pathfinder }* envision, Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: The helm's gun barrels swivel and aim randomly, then conjure enough gunpowder and bullets to fire in all directions around you. Every creature within a 20-foot emanation takes 4d6 piercing damage (DC 19 [[Basic]] Reflex save). When determining a creature's resistance or immunity to this damage, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to piercing or bludgeoning.
