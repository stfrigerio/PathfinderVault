# Genealogy Mask

**Item 1**

> These large masks are forged of precious metals or carved of wood and tasked with guarding the history of a family. Most Alijae are granted a *genealogy* mask when they come of age, which they bequeath to their next of kin upon death. When a member of the family recounted in the *genealogy mask* performs a particularly significant event while wearing the mask, its eyes and ears animate, allowing the item to witness and record the deeds for posterity. Different families have different standards for their *genealogy masks* —some may value accuracy and objective, clinical facts, while others may relish embellishing their stories to the very brink of believability in the name of a good story.

*⬻{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You ask the mask about the deeds of a particular ancestor, and the mask speaks for 10 minutes, recalling the tales it knows about that ancestor. The mask is limited by what information a particular ancestor shared with it.
