# Ring of Recalcitrant Wishes

**Item 20**

> This band of interwoven gold and copper, traced with [[Aklo]] symbols, is topped with a gleaming, luminescent opal gently bleeding wisps of shadowstuff.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬½{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Effect**: You attempt to make the ring cast an arcane *[[Wish]]* spell. However, if the ring doesn't deem the wish to be sufficiently selfless, the wish isn't cast and the ring can't be activated for 24 hours. You are [[Drained 3]], whether or not the ring refuses the wish. Once the wish is cast, the *Ring of Recalcitrant Wishes* has no powers, though it is rumored that the wearer's death in an act of profound self-sacrifice restores the *wish* to the ring.
