# Sunflower Censer

**Item 8**

> This gold-and-ivory incense burner always emits a pleasant, floral-scented smoke without any need to be refilled. It has a chain that can be easily affixed to a belt or bag, allowing it to be worn without a free hand. As long as the censer is burning, the bearer benefits from the *[[Undetectable Alignment]]* spell. They also don't appear [[Undead]] to [[Magic/Divination]] spells or abilities, or to senses such as [[Lifesense]], unless those abilities successfully [[Counteract]] the censer. The censer can be lit or extinguished with an Interact action.

```ad-embed-ability
