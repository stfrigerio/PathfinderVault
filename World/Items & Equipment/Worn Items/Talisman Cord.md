# Talisman Cord

**Item 4+**

> This thin leather cord bears delicate runic markings and threads through an item that can bear affixed [[Talismans]]. When you [[Affix A Talisman]] to that item, you can thread the talisman onto the cord, activating the cord's preserving effects. The cord is attuned to a particular school of magic, chosen when the cord was created. It gains the corresponding trait for that school. When you activate a talisman threaded through a cord with the same magic school trait that's also the cord's level or lower, attempt a DC 16 flat check. On a success, that talisman is not consumed and can be used again.
