# Mind's Light Circlet

**Item 11**

> Gemstones of many colors adorn the silver of a *mind's light circlet*. When you're charged with mental power, the jewels scintillate with light, with different gems resonating based on your emotions. If you have at least 1 Focus Point, the gems cast [[Dim Light]] in a 10-foot radius. When you amp a spell, the light increases to [[Bright Light]] in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) until the start of your next turn.You gain a +2 item bonus to [[Occultism]] checks. You also gain the following [[Amp]], which you can apply to any of your psi cantrips that have a target or area, much like an amp gained from a feat.
**Amp**: You transfer some of the magical luminescence from the mind's light circlet to one of the creatures. Choose a creature targeted by the spell or in its area. Until the start of your next turn, that creature sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) and can't be [[Concealed]]. If the creature is [[Invisible]], it's concealed while alight, rather than being [[Undetected]].
