# Hag Eye

**Item 3+**

> This item appears to be an ordinary semiprecious stone and is typically mounted on a brooch or ring, but the stone is, in fact, an eyeball. This illusion can be seen through with *[[True Seeing]]* or similar magic, and anyone who interacts with the item feels its wet and sticky surface, allowing them to attempt to [[Disbelieve]] the illusion (DC 19). Many hags claim a *hag eye* is more effective if plucked from a living, awake creature, but this is likely just a convenient excuse for sadism.The *hag eye* produces no direct benefit for the wearer, but allows the [[Hag]] who created it, or any member of her coven, can peer through the eye using the [[Seek]] action. This has no range limit, provided the hag is on the same plane.Any damage dealt to the eye destroys it. If this happens while a hag is looking through it, the hag is [[Blinded]] for 1 hour.
**Craft Requirements**: You must be a hag.
