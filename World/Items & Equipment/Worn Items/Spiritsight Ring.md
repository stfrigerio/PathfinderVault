# Spiritsight Ring

**Item 6**

> The opal set in the intricately carved ivory *spiritsight ring* eventually becomes translucent and tickles your finger whenever an [[Incorporeal]] creature is nearby. When in the presence of a nearby incorporeal creature, even if it's within a solid object, you eventually detect the creature, though you might not do so instantly, and you can't pinpoint the location. This acts as a [[Vague Sense]], like humans' sense of smell. An incorporeal creature trying to hide its presence from this sense attempts a [[Stealth]] check against your Perception DC to hide from your vague sense, as normal for attempting to foil [[Special Senses]]. You gain a +2 item bonus when using the [[Seek]] action to find [[Hidden]] or [[Undetected]] incorporeal creatures within 30 feet of you.
