# Bladed Hoop

> This circular hoop has blades along its outer edge. You can wield it in two hands (using the two-hand damage) or by spinning it around an arm. While you spin the hoop, it gains the [[Free-Hand]] trait. Setting the hoop spinning takes 1 Interact action. In addition to the normal restrictions of the free-hand trait, extended use of the arm for locomotion (such as to [[Climb]] ) interferes with the hoop’s spinning and forces you to Release the hoop. You can’t spin a hoop underwater. Keeping the hoop spinning requires a free action each round, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits. You can keep a hoop spinning as an exploration activity, but doing so for more than 10 minutes makes you fatigued, similarly to [[Hustling]].

## Traits

**Finesse:** You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.

**Sweep:** This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.

**Two-Hand 1d8:** This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This change applies to all the weapon's damage dice, such as those from *[[Striking]]* runes.

**Uncommon:** Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Knife**: The target takes 1d6 [[Persistent Bleed Damage]]. You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls.
