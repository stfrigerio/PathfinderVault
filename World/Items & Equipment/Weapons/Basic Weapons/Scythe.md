# Scythe

> Derived from a farming tool used to mow down long grains and cereals, this weapon has a long wooden shaft with protruding handles, capped with a curved blade set at a right angle.

## Traits

**Deadly d10:** On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon's damage. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a *greater striking rune* and three dice if the weapon has a *major striking rune*. For instance, a [[Rapier]] with a *greater striking rune* deals 2d8 extra piercing damage on a critical hit. An ability that changes the size of the weapon's normal damage dice doesn't change the size of its deadly die.

**Trip:** You can use this weapon to [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Trip]] with the [[Athletics]] skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's [[Reach]] (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Polearm**: The target is moved 5 feet in a direction of your choice. This is [[Forced Movement]].
