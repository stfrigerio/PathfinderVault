# Tri-Bladed Katar

> This punching dagger resembles the standard katar, save that a pair of blades can be folded out from the center blade, transforming the weapon into a starburst shape well suited to catching foes' weapons.

## Traits

**Disarm:** You can use this weapon to [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Disarm]] with the [[Athletics]] skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's [[Reach]] (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.

**Fatal d8:** The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weaponâ€™s damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.

**Monk:** Abilities with this trait are from the [[Monk]] class. A weapon with this trait is primarily used by monks.

**Uncommon:** Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Knife**: The target takes 1d6 [[Persistent Bleed Damage]]. You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls.
