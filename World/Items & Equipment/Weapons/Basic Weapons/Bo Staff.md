# Bo Staff

> This strong but slender staff is tapered at the ends and well balanced. Itâ€™s designed to be an offensive and defensive weapon.

## Traits

**Monk:** Abilities with this trait are from the [[Monk]] class. A weapon with this trait is primarily used by monks.

**Parry:** This weapon can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your proficiency with it is trained or better, you can spend a single action to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

**Reach:** Natural attacks with this trait can be used to attack creatures up to the listed distance away instead of only adjacent creatures. Weapons with this trait are long and can be used to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.

**Trip:** You can use this weapon to [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Trip]] with the [[Athletics]] skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's [[Reach]] (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Club**: You knock the target away from you up to 10 feet (you choose the distance). This is [[Forced Movement]].
