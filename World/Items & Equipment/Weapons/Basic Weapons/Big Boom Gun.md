# Big Boom Gun

**Item 1**

> Developed by a goblin weaponsmith who missed the ‘hand' part of ‘hand cannon', this comically-oversized gun has a heavily reinforced barrel and is loaded with a worrisome quantity of gunpowder. This [[Hand Cannon]] is a martial weapon, instead of a simple weapon. It has the fatal d12 trait and a range of 20 feet. It also has the following modified critical failure condition:
**Critical Failure**The attack misses, the weapon misfires, and you take 1d12 fire damage as it explodes in your face.Big boom guns and spoon guns are modified versions  of hand cannons with potential benefits and drawbacks  alike, rather than separate weapons. If you have access  to the spoon gun or big boom gun modifications, you  can purchase them whenever you would purchase a hand cannon, and effects that depend upon and apply to hand  cannons apply to both weapons.

## Traits

**Cobbled:** This firearm is cobbled together and likely to misfire. No matter how well you upkeep it, on a failed attack roll, the attack misses and you must roll a DC 5 flat check. If you fail this check, the weapon misfires.

**Fatal d12:** The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weapon’s damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.

**Goblin:** A creature with this trait can be one of several kinds of creature, including [[Goblins]] , [[Hobgoblins]] , and [[Bugbears]]. Goblins tend to have [[Darkvision]]. An ability with this trait can be used or chosen only by goblins. A weapon with this trait is created and used by goblins.

**Modular B, P, or S:** The weapon has multiple configurations that you can switch between using an Interact action. Typically, switching between configurations of a modular weapon allows it to deal different types of damage (listed in the trait, such as “modular B, P, or S”), though it’s possible for a modular weapon’s description to list more complicated configurations.

**Uncommon:** Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Firearm**: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[Stunned 1]].
