# Wheel Blades

> A set of large blades have been attached to your chair's wheels. While in the chair, you gain a wheel blade Strike. Your wheel blade deals 1d4 slashing damage and has the [[Agile]] , [[Attached]] , and [[Free-Hand]] traits. A wheel blade is a simple melee weapon in the [[Sword]] weapon group. You can etch weapon runes onto wheel blades. A wheelchair can only have one attached weapon.

## Traits

**Agile:** The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.

**Attached:** An attached weapon must be combined with another piece of gear to be used. The trait lists what type of item the weapon must be attached to. You must be wielding or wearing the item the weapon is attached to in order to attack with it. For example, [[Shield Spikes]] are attached to a shield, allowing you to attack with the spikes instead of a [[Shield Bash]] , but only if you're wielding the shield. An attached weapon is usually bolted onto or built into the item it's attached to, and typically an item can have only one weapon attached to it. An attached weapon can be affixed to an item with 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 10 [[Crafting]] check; this includes the time needed to remove the weapon from a previous item, if necessary. If an item is destroyed, its attached weapon can usually be salvaged.

**Free-Hand:** This weapon doesn't take up your hand, usually because it is built into your armor. A free-hand weapon can't be [[Disarmed]]. You can use the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform [[Manipulate]] actions, and so on. You can't attack with a free-hand weapon if you're wielding anything in that hand or otherwise using that hand. When you're not wielding anything and not otherwise using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to have a hand free as well as those that require you to be wielding a weapon in that hand. Each of your hands can have only one free-hand weapon on it.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Sword**: The target is made off-balance by your attack, becoming [[Flat-Footed]] until the start of your next turn.
