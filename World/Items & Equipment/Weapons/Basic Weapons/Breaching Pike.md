# Breaching Pike

> Forged with a heavy metal wedge as a spearhead, breaching pikes are often used by [[Hobgoblin]] infantry alongside a [[Tower Shield]]. Breaching pikes are particularly effective at damaging enemy shields, leaving large, triangular puncture holes behind.

## Traits

**Hobgoblin:** Hobgoblins are a sturdy, clever people with a propensity for militaristic order

**Razing:** Razing weapons are particularly good at damaging objects, structures, and vehicles. Whenever you deal damage to an object (including [[Shields]] and [[Animated Objects]] ), structure, or vehicle with a razing weapon, the object takes an amount of additional damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.

**Reach:** Natural attacks with this trait can be used to attack creatures up to the listed distance away instead of only adjacent creatures. Weapons with this trait are long and can be used to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.

**Uncommon:** Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Spear**: The weapon pierces the target, weakening its attacks. The target is [[Clumsy 1]] until the start of your next turn.
