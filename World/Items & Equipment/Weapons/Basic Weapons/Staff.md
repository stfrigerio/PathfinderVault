> This long piece of wood can aid in walking and deliver a mighty blow.

## Traits

**Two-Hand 1d8:** This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This change applies to all the weapon's damage dice, such as those from *[[Striking]]* runes.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Club**: You knock the target away from you up to 10 feet (you choose the distance). This is [[Forced Movement]].
