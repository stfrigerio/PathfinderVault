# Alchemical Bomb

> These bombs come in a variety of types and levels of power, but no matter the variety, you throw the bomb at the target and it explodes, unleashing its alchemical blast. [[Click Here For A List Of Alchemical Bombs.]] 

## Traits

**Varies:** The traits of an alchemical bomb vary between different bombs.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Bomb**: Increase the radius of the bomb's [[Splash]] damage (if any) to 10 feet.
