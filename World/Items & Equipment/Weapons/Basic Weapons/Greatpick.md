# Greatpick

> This pick has a longer handle and broader head than a regular pick. It is too heavy to wield in one hand.

## Traits

**Fatal 1d12:** The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weaponâ€™s damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Pick**: The weapon viciously pierces the target, who takes 2 additional damage per weapon damage die.
