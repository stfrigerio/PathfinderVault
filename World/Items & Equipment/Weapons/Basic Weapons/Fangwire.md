# Fangwire

> This [[Kobold]] wire is thin and hard to see, making it perfect for an ambush. The wielder wraps the wire around a vulnerable spot, such as the neck, and twists it to inflict potentially fatal lacerations. The name derives from the use of a similar wire in traps, or slow fangs, with the word “slow” removed, as a fangwire gets quick results.

## Traits

**Agile:** The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.

**Backstabber:** When you hit a [[Flat-Footed]] creature, this weapon deals 1 precision damage in addition to its normal damage. The precision damage increases to 2 if the weapon is a *+3 weapon*.

**Deadly d8:** On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon's damage. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a *greater striking rune* and three dice if the weapon has a *major striking rune*. For instance, a [[Rapier]] with a *greater striking rune* deals 2d8 extra piercing damage on a critical hit. An ability that changes the size of the weapon's normal damage dice doesn't change the size of its deadly die.

**Finesse:** You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.

**Grapple:** You can use this weapon to [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Grapple]] with the [[Athletics]] skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's [[Reach]] (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

**Kobold:** A creature with this trait is a member of the kobold ancestry. Kobolds are reptilian [[Humanoids]] who are usually Small and typically have [[Darkvision]]. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by kobolds.

**Uncommon:** Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Brawling**: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[Slowed 1]] until the end of your next turn.
