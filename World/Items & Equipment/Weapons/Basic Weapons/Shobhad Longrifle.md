# Shobhad Longrifle

**Item 1**

> The shobhad longrifle is a firearm with a long, rifled barrel. Often mounted with a multi-lensed scope for targeting at an array of ranges and a chambering mechanism that can adjust the speed and penetrating power of each shot, it's the preferred weapon of many [[Shobhad]] warriors. Shobhad longrifles are equipped with a built-in [[Silencer]] so they make no more noise than a crossbow when fired. A shobhad longrifle is a martial weapon.

## Traits

**Backstabber:** When you hit a [[Flat-Footed]] creature, this weapon deals 1 precision damage in addition to its normal damage. The precision damage increases to 2 if the weapon is a *+3 weapon*.

**Concussive:** These weapons smash as much as puncture. When determining a creature's resistance or immunity to damage from this weapon, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to piercing or to bludgeoning. For instance, if the creature were immune to piercing and had no resistance or immunity to bludgeoning damage, it would take full damage from a concussive weapon. Resistance or immunity to all physical damage, or all damage, applies as normal.

**Fatal d12:** The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weapon’s damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.

**Kickback:** A kickback weapon is extra powerful and difficult to use due to its high recoil. A kickback weapon deals 1 additional damage with all attacks. Firing a kickback weapon gives a –2 circumstance penalty to the attack roll, but characters with 14 or more Strength ignore the penalty. Attaching a kickback weapon to a deployed bipod, tripod, or other stabilizer can lower or negate this penalty.

**Rare:** This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.

**Volley:** This ranged weapon is less effective at close distances. Your attacks against targets that are at a distance within the range listed take a –2 penalty.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Firearm**: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[Stunned 1]].
