# Spear

> A long metal shaft ending with a metal spike, a spear can be used one-handed as a melee weapon and can be thrown.

## Traits

**Thrown 20 ft.:** You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack, and it is a ranged weapon when thrown. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment specified in the weaponâ€™s Range entry.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Spear**: The weapon pierces the target, weakening its attacks. The target is [[Clumsy 1]] until the start of your next turn.
