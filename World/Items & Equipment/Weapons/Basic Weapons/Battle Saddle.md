# Battle Saddle

> The battle saddle is a special saddle for a mount that has two large, winglike blades. These blades normally lie flat alongside the saddle, providing additional protection for the rider, but they can be deployed with a tug on the reins to slash at enemies adjacent to the mount. When using a battle saddle to parry, you can decide whether the circumstance bonus to AC applies to you or to your mount.

## Traits

**Parry:** This weapon can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your proficiency with it is trained or better, you can spend a single action to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

**Sweep:** This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.

**Vehicular:** A vehicular weapon is attached to a vehicle or worn by a mount and can typically only be wielded by the driver of the vehicle or the mount's primary rider. The driver or rider can control a vehicular weapon with the same hands they use to steer the vehicle or guide the mount. A vehicular weapon can be [[Disarmed]] by knocking the controls (typically reins for a mount or a steering device for a vehicle) out of the wielder's hands.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Axe**: Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including extra dice for its *potency* rune, if any). This amount isn't doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.
