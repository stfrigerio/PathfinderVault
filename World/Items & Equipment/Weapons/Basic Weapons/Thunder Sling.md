# Thunder Sling

>  [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu]] use these specialized slings to fire darts further and with greater force than when thrown by hand. A thunder sling uses darts as ammunition. It can also hurl [[Blowgun Darts]] as ammunition but deals 1d4 piercing damage instead of 1d6 when used this way.

## Traits

**Agile:** The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.

**Propulsive:** You add half your Strength modifier (if positive) to damage rolls with a propulsive ranged weapon. If you have a negative Strength modifier, you add your full Strength modifier instead.

**Tengu:** A creature with this trait is a member of the tengu ancestry. Tengus are [[Humanoids]] who resemble birds. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by tengus. An item with this trait is created and used by tengus.

**Uncommon:** Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Sling**: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[Stunned 1]].
