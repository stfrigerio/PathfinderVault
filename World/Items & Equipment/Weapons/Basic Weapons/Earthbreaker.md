# Earthbreaker

> This massive hammer's metal head is shaped or molded with heavy metal wedges along its primary striking surface, enabling it to tear through shields and armor with ease.

## Traits

**Razing:** Razing weapons are particularly good at damaging objects, structures, and vehicles. Whenever you deal damage to an object (including [[Shields]] and [[Animated Objects]] ), structure, or vehicle with a razing weapon, the object takes an amount of additional damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.

**Shove:** You can use this weapon to [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Shove]] with the [[Athletics]] skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's [[Reach]] (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

**Two-Hand d10:** This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This change applies to all the weapon's damage dice, such as those from *[[Striking]]* runes.

**Versatile P:** A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than that listed in the Damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon that is versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Hammer**: The target is knocked [[Prone]].
