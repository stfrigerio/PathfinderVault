# Leiomano

> This thick club is inset with sharp teeth, typically from a shark, that easily tear flesh. It's the preferred weapon of many Minatan warriors.

## Traits

**Fatal d10:** The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weaponâ€™s damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.

**Uncommon:** Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

**Versatile S:** A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than that listed in the Damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon that is versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Club**: You knock the target away from you up to 10 feet (you choose the distance). This is [[Forced Movement]].
