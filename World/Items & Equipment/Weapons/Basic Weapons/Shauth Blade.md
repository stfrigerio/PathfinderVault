# Shauth Blade

> These strange curved blades are jagged and deadly weapons made from the alchemically strengthened teeth of dead urdefhans. Each weapon is typically named for the [[Urdefhan]] whose teeth were forged into the weapon, which are often carried (and revered) by that urdefhan's descendants. Magical shauth blades allow an urdefhan wielder to channel their Wicked Bite ability through shauth blade Strikes.

## Traits

**Agile:** The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.

**Deadly d8:** On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon's damage. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a *greater striking rune* and three dice if the weapon has a *major striking rune*. For instance, a [[Rapier]] with a *greater striking rune* deals 2d8 extra piercing damage on a critical hit. An ability that changes the size of the weapon's normal damage dice doesn't change the size of its deadly die.

**Finesse:** You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.

**Uncommon:** Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

**Versatile P:** A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than that listed in the Damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon that is versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Knife**: The target takes 1d6 [[Persistent Bleed Damage]]. You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls.
