# Griffon Cane

> A griffon cane is named for the shape of its base, which features four small pronged supports splayed out in a manner similar to a griffon's talons. A griffon cane's splayed foot enables it to stand upright by itself. A griffon cane deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage, has the [[Backswing]] and [[Two-Hand D10]] traits, and is a martial melee weapon in the [[Club]] weapon group.

## Traits

**Backswing:** You can use the momentum from a missed attack with this weapon to lead into your next attack. After missing with this weapon on your turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack with this weapon before the end of your turn.

**Two-Hand d10:** This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This change applies to all the weapon's damage dice, such as those from *[[Striking]]* runes.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Club**: You knock the target away from you up to 10 feet (you choose the distance). This is [[Forced Movement]].
