# Dart Umbrella

> This umbrella fires tiny blowgun darts from its ferrule with a twist of the handle. The darts are loaded into the shaft, and though the damage they deal is minimal, the dart umbrella is an inconspicuous weapon easy to slip past inspections.

## Traits

**Agile:** The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.

**Concealable:** This weapon is designed to be inconspicuous or easily concealed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Stealth]] checks and DCs to hide or conceal a weapon with this trait.

**Nonlethal:** An effect with this trait is not inherently deadly. Damage from a nonlethal effect knocks a creature out rather than killing it. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a –2 circumstance penalty.

**Uncommon:** Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Dart**: The target takes 1d6 [[Persistent Bleed Damage]]. You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls.
