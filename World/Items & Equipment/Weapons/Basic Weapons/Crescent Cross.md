## Traits

**Capacity 3:** Weapons that have the capacity trait typically have multiple barrels or chambers capable of containing a bolt or round of ammunition. Capacity is always accompanied by a number indicating the number of barrels or chambers. After a capacity weapon is fired, you can select the next loaded barrel or chamber as an Interact action that doesn't require a free hand. You can use abilities that let or require you to Interact to reload to switch barrels or chambers of a capacity weapon instead. Each barrel or chamber can be individually reloaded after it's fired as a separate Interact action.

**Combination:** Combination weapons combine the functionality of melee weapons and ranged weapons in unique or unusual ways. A combination weapon has a ranged form or usage and a melee weapon form or usage. The combination weapons table lists the ranged weapon statistics first and the melee weapon statistics indented beneath, just above the ammunition. Switching between the melee weapon usage and the ranged weapon usage requires an Interact action. However, if your last action was a successful melee Strike against a foe using a combination weapon, you can make a ranged Strike with the combination weapon against that foe without fully switching to the ranged weapon usage, firing the ranged weapon just as you hit with the melee attack. In this case, the combination weapon returns to its melee usage after the ranged weapon Strike.Since a combination weapon is one weapon with two usages, both usages share any [[Fundamental Runes]]. You can put a property rune on a combination weapon as long as it's appropriate for either of the two usages, but if only one of the usages meets the property rune's requirements, the effects of the property rune only apply for that usage. For instance, a *[[Vorpal]]  [[Axe Musket]]* only applies the *vorpal* property rune when you're using it as an axe. Due to their complexity, combination weapons can't have another weapon, such as a [[Bayonet]] or [[Reinforced Stock]] , attached to them.

**Critical Fusion:** Critical fusion is a trait for [[Combination]] weapons that grants you two additional options for the critical specialization effect when using the combination weapon's melee version to make a melee attack while the ranged weapon is loaded. If you choose to use one of them, it replaces the melee usage's normal [[Critical Specialization Effect]].First, if the ranged weapon is a [[Firearm]] , you can discharge it to create a loud bang and concussion, using the critical specialization effect for firearms instead of the melee weapon group's critical specialization effect. Second, you can choose to discharge the ranged weapon to increase the critical hit's momentum or shoot the foe as you attack in melee, dealing 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Both of these options discharge the ranged weapon, which typically means you have to reload it before firing it again.

**Parry:** This weapon can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your proficiency with it is trained or better, you can spend a single action to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Bow**: If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile. The target is [[Immobilized]] and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 [[Athletics]] check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds. The creature doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a [[Water Elemental]] or some [[Oozes]] ), or could otherwise escape without effort.
