# Drake Rifle

**Item 4**

> A *drake rifle* is a firearm made from the saliva glands of a [[Drake]]. The firearm launches small bursts of empowered spittle instead of typical rounds of ammunition. A drake rifle is a *+1 weapon*. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals 1d10 damage with a range increment of 150 feet and [[Reload 1]]. It deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage, depending on the drake from which it was made. On a critical hit, the spittle clings to the target and they take [[Persistent Damage]] of the same type as the weapon equal to 1d4 + the number of weapon damage dice. A drake rifle does not add critical specialization effects.
