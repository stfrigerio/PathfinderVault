# Breath Blaster

**Item 8+**

> A *breath blaster* is a *+1 [[Striking]] [[World/Items & Equipment/Weapons/Guns/Blunderbuss]]* most commonly crafted from the trachea of a [[Dragon]], though other creatures with breath weapons or the ability to spit energy are occasionally used. The implementation of the dragon's trachea allows the firearm to unleash a torrent of pure energy in the form of gouts of flame or bolts of electricity.A *breath blaster's* Strikes deal either acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage, depending on the dragon type or other creature from which it was made, though it can otherwise be used like a normal blunderbuss. A *breath blaster* also can be activated to fire a line of energy in a 30-foot line or 15-foot cone, chosen when it's created and typically corresponding to the shape of the breath weapon used by the type of dragon or creature from which the breath blaster was created.In theory, the foundational techniques required to create a *breath blaster* would allow for other damage types, but such *breath blasters* would require the trachea from the correct dragon or creature type and additional creation techniques, making such a *breath blaster* rare rather than uncommon.
