# Growth Gun

**Item 9**

> A *growth gun* is a *+1 [[Striking]] [[Hand Cannon]]* made from the regenerative flesh of a [[Hydra]], [[Troll]], or other similar creature. It has an attached flesh sac that slowly replenishes one shot each round and can be loaded like a normal round of ammunition. It fires regenerating gobbets of flesh, bone, or teeth, determined by the damage type selected for its [[Modular]] trait. A growth gun can be fired underwater, though it's still limited by the selected damage type as normal.

**Frequency**: once per minute;
**Effect**: Make a ranged Strike. On a hit, the creature becomes covered in a mass of flesh that continues to grow on the target for a brief time. The creature becomes [[Slowed 1]] for 1 round, after which the growth withers and falls off.

```

**Craft Requirements**: The initial raw materials must include the flesh of a creature with [[Regeneration]].
