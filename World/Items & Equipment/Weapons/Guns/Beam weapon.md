> - Laser pistols, rifles, torches, and x-lasers, all burning weapons that emit [[Laser|intensely focused light]]
> - Death rays, which fire beams of biologically devastating [[Nanite|nanites]]
> - EMP pistols and rifles capable of disrupting [[Robot|robots]], [[Android|androids]], and other electrical devices and creatures, but not living creatures
> - Gravity pistols and rifles, which can fire beams of [[Gravity|gravity]]-manipulating gravitons
> - Sonic pistols and rifles capable of emitting powerful sound waves
> - Nuclear resonators, powerful sonic weapons that can be attuned to specific molecular structures
> - Zero pistols and rifles, guns that fire rays of supercooled particles
