# Spike Launcher

**Item 6**

> Built from the spiked tail of a [[Manticore]], a *spike launcher* is designed to launch large, spear-like projectiles. A spike launcher is a *+1 striking weapon*. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals 1d8 piercing damage. It has the [[Backstabber]], [[Fatal Aim D12]], and [[Kickback]] traits with a [[Range Increment]] of 120 feet and [[Reload 2]]. It uses the critical specialization of the [[Bow]] weapon group, rather than the firearm critical specialization.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬽{.Pathfinder }* Interact ([[Evocation]] [[Magical]]) 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Requirements**: The *spike launcher* is loaded;
**Effect**: The *spike launcher* fires a volley of smaller spikes in a 10-foot burst centered anywhere within its range. Make a Strike with the *spike launcher* against each creature in the area. On a success, the spike causes the creature to take a –5-foot status penalty to their Speed. On a critical success, the creature becomes [[Immobilized]] instead. In either case, the creature, or an adjacent creature, can use an Interact action to remove the spike and end the penalty or immobilized condition.

```

**Craft Requirements**: The initial raw materials must include the tail of a manticore.
