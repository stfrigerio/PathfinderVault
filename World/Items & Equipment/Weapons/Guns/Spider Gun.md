# Spider Gun

**Item 6+**

> A *spider gun* is a *+1 striking weapon*. It's a distinct type of martial firearm made from the fangs and spinneret of a Large spider. It deals 1d10 poison damage with a [[Range Increment]] of 30 feet and [[Reload 1]]. On a critical hit, the venom clings to the target and they take [[Persistent Poison Damage]] equal to 1d4 + the number of weapon damage dice. A spider gun does not add critical specialization effects. The gun can be activated to fire webbing that hampers other creatures.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact ([[Conjuration]] [[Magical]]) 
**Frequency**: once per round;
**Effect**: You fire a mass of webbing at a square within 30 feet. That square becomes covered in webbing for 1 minute. A square covered with the webbing from a *spider gun* can be cleared by a single attack or effect that deals at least 5 slashing damage or 1 fire damage. A square has AC 5, and it automatically fails its saving throws. The first time each turn a creature in the webbing begins to use a move action or enters the webbing during a move action, it must attempt an [[Athletics]] check or Reflex save against DC 20. On a success, it moves normally through the webbing and clears away the webbing from any squares it enters this turn. On a failure, it treats squares of webbing as difficult terrain this turn, and on a critical failure, it's [[Immobilized]] for 1 round or until it [[Escapes]] (DC 20) or destroys the webbing.

```

**Craft Requirements**: The initial raw materials for the *spider gun* must include the fangs and spinneret of a giant spider or other Large spider.
