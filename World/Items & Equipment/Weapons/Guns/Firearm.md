> **Firearms** are among the most [[Technology|technologically]] advanced, and thus rarest, [[Weapon|weapons]] manufactured in modern [[Golarion]]. Most of these gunpowder projectile weapons are manufactured in the [[Magic|magic-bereft]] city-state of [[Alkenstar]] and [[Dongun Hold]], where advanced [[Engineering|engineering]], access to raw materials, and necessity have perfected the art over thousands of years. Over 90 percent of all firearms in the world are owned and maintained within Alkenstar itself, but mercenaries, emigrants, and highly profitable trade have spread these weapons throughout the world—if one knows where to look for them. In general, guns manufactured in the massive [[Gunworks]] are of basic quality, but more artistic gunsmiths and craftsmen populate [[Alkenstar City]] and are more than willing to make custom weapons of higher quality or upgrade existing production-line units. In the distant lands of the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]] the city of [[Ukhrul]] is also renowned for manufacturing firearms and other innovative weapons of war.
> The most popular firearm in Golarion is the [[Pistol|pistol]]. Examples of other firearms include the [[Musket|musket]] and the [[Revolver|revolver]].


## Specific firearms

> Most firearms are made from the same molds on the production line of the Gunworks, but other weapons are unique and notable in their own right, whether for their sheer size or a specific quality or function.

Built for the nation's own defense in [[4450 AR]], this bombard stands guard over Alkenstar, built into the side of the [[Hellfallen Cliffs]].

## Technological firearms

> In addition to the projectile-firing weapons natively developed on Golarion, an even smaller number of similar weapons are scattered across places like [[Numeria]], where alien [[Spaceship|spaceships]] crashed into Golarion carrying advanced technology. These foreign firearms—including rail guns, rocket and grenade launchers, dart guns, flare guns, and autograpnels—can be extraordinarily powerful compared to their native counterparts.
> Many such technological firearms take forms similar to Golarion's, but instead of firing discrete projectiles, they might unleash [[Beam weapon|continuous beams of energy]]. These include [[Laser|laser pistols and rifles]], death rays, and atom guns.
> There are rumors that another [[World/Geography/Planes & Planets/Earth|distant world]] has a [[Russia|nation]] possessing their own advanced firearms.
