 A bladed scarf among other Varisian weapons.
> The **bladed scarf** is a [[Weapon|weapon]] developed by [[Varisian|Varisians]]. With their free and open attitude, and the fact that their performances can elicit strong emotional responses, they needed to have a weapon that blended into their costumes, but could still protect them if needed.
> One side of the [[Scarf|scarf]] looks like a normal, brightly colored performance scarf, while the other side has a number of blades woven into it. Because of the length of the scarf, the wielder can attack people up to ten feet away, but the flexibility allows them to also attack those the wielder finds themselves grappled with.
