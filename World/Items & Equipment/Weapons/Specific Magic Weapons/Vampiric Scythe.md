# Vampiric Scythe

**Item 13**

> The blade of this *+2 [[Greater Striking]] [[Wounding]] [[Scythe]]* is sharp enough to produce a whistling sound when swung through the air. The shaft is made of ebony wood with a sickly shine to it, much like the shine of infected wounds and contaminated water.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬲{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Trigger**: An enemy critically succeeds at an attempt to [[Disarm]] you;
**Effect**: As the scythe leaves your hand, it drinks the triggering creature's blood. The creature must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or become [[Drained 2]] (drained 3 on a critical failure). If the triggering creature becomes drained, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to the triggering creature's level. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬲{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Trigger**: You critically succeed at a Strike against a living opponent;
**Effect**: The scythe drains life essence from your opponent into you. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half the slashing damage the scythe dealt to the foe. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.
