# Reaper's Crescent

**Item 9**

> The blade of this alabaster *+1 [[Striking]] [[Sickle]]* grows thick and pitted as the moon waxes, and it thins to a sharp sliver as the moon wanes. Moonlight also causes a second rune on the blade to change shape with the moon's phases: during the new and crescent moon, the weapon has the *[[Ghost Touch]]* rune; during the quarter moon, the *[[Fearsome]]* rune; and during the gibbous and full moon, the *[[Wounding]]* rune.When wielded under moonlight of any strength, the reaper *'s crescent* deals additional cold damage equal to the number of damage dice.
