# Habu's Cudgel

**Item 8**

> Long associated with a notorious crime boss in Nantambu, this stout *+1 [[Striking]] [[Fearsome]] [[Club]]* is studded with vicious-looking knobs of obsidian and wrapped in cloth for a better grip. It emits a ghastly groan when swung.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You gesture at a square within 40 feet with *Habu's Cudgel*. The club causes a frightful wail to unleash from that square and casts *[[Fear]]* (DC 24 Will save) targeting the creature in that square and all adjacent creatures.

```
