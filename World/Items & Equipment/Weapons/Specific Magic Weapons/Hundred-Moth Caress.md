# Hundred-Moth Caress

**Item 8**

> The handles of this *+1 [[Striking]] [[Scythe]]* are made from a dull, gray wood of bone-like consistency, and when you slice with it, a fluttering gust of hundreds of moths' wingbeats fills the air. If you're a devotee of [[Urgathoa]], you can use this scythe as a divine focus, and with every Strike, it exudes a pallid cloud of powdery dust.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â­“{.Pathfinder }* command ([[Divine]] [[Necromancy]] [[Negative]]) 
**Frequency**: once per round;
**Effect**: You deal 1d10 negative damage to yourself. If your next action is to Strike with the scythe or to Cast a Spell with the [[Disease]] or negative trait, that Strike or spell deals additional negative damage equal to the damage you took (after any reductions or increases from immunity, resistances, weaknesses).

```
