# Grounding Spike

**Item 10**

> Metal caps the bottom of this *+1 [[Striking]] [[Thundering]] [[Dancer'S Spear]]* and its point gives off the faint smell of ozone. If you hit a target that has been struck by a *[[Polarizing Mace]]* within the last round, you deal additional electricity damage to the target equal to the number of *grounding spike's* damage dice. If you critically hit such a target, the creature is [[Flat-Footed]] until the start of your next turn.
**Special**: The *grounding spike* pairs with the *polarizing mace*.
