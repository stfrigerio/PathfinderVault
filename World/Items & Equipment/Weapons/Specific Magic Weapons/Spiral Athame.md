# Spiral Athame

**Item 22**

> The pommel of this +4 [[Major Striking]] [[Disruptive]] [[Ghost Touch]] [[High-Grade Silver]] [[Dagger]] is a black glass orb that contains a tiny blue comet that spirals through the orb's interior. Strikes with the dagger deal an additional 1d8 positive damage to worshippers of [[Urgathoa]] and to anyone who has ever created or [[Summoned]] an [[Undead]] creature.While the dagger is in your possession, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to [[Medicine]] checks and to [[Midwifery Lore]] checks. If you're a worshipper of [[Pharasma]], you gain [[Imprecise]] [[Lifesense]] with a range of 60 feet while holding the dagger. If you're undead or a worshipper of Urgathoa, you're [[Stupefied 4]] while holding the dagger.Despite its utility in combat, the *Spiral Athame* is intended as a ritual implement, meant to bless newborns and protect them from the predations of undead. If you use the *Spiral Athame* to cut the umbilical cord of a newly born creature, that creature gains resistance to negative damage equal to their level (minimum 1) and gains a +2 status bonus to saving throws against [[Death]] effects and [[Necromancy]]. These bonuses are permanent. Additionally, that creature can never become an undead creature.
