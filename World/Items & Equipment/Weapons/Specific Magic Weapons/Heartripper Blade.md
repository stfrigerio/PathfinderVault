# Heartripper Blade

**Item 5**

> This wicked-looking curved weapon is a *+1 [[Striking]] [[Dagger]]* that draws power from defeating foes, either to bolster itself or its wielder. A *heartripper blade* is well suited for use in any ritual that involves divination, and incorporating it into any ritual with the [[Magic/Divination]] trait grants the wielder a +1 item bonus on any check made to resolve the effects of the ritual's casting.
