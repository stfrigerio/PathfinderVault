# North Wind's Night Verse

**Item 10**

> This *+1 [[Striking]] [[Frost]] [[Katana]]* is always cool to the touch, nearly uncomfortably so. Unadorned and with no tsuba, its honed blade is carved from a single tusk of [[Dragon-Turtle]] ivory and wrapped in strips of [[Winter Wolf]] hide. Strikes with the katana gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls against creatures that have a status penalty to their Speed or are [[Slowed]]. The status bonus increases to +3 if the weapon has a *greater striking rune* and +4 for *major striking*.

*⭓{.Pathfinder }* command ([[Cold]] [[Evocation]] [[Magical]]) 
**Frequency**: once per 1 minute;
**Trigger**: Your spell deals cold damage to a creature;
**Effect**: Choose one creature dealt cold damage by the spell. It takes a –5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
