# Retribution Axe

**Item 3**

> The blade of this *+1 [[Greataxe]]* bears a design of a human skull. Whenever a creature damages you with an attack, the skull changes its appearance to look like the face of that creature. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your next damage roll against that creature before the end of your next turn. Because the face reshapes each time youâ€™re damaged, you get the additional damage only if you attack the creature that damaged you most recently.
