# Torag's Silver Anvil

**Item 18**

> This portable silver anvil has a narrow hoop on one end, through which a long, sturdy chain has been strung. *[[Torag'S]] Silver Anvil* can be wielded as a *+3 [[Holy]] [[Greater Flaming]] [[Greater Striking]] [[Silver]] [[Meteor Hammer]]*. Outside of combat, the anvil can be used with a hammer as an incredibly effective portable forge, heating up the metal to be forged without a furnace and granting a +3 item bonus to [[Crafting]] checks involving metalworking. When you use the anvil to successfully [[Repair]] a metal item, the item recovers an additional 10 Hit Points (or an additional 20 on a critical success).
