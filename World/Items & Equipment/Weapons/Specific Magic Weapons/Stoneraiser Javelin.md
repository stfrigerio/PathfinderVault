# Stoneraiser Javelin

**Item 11**

> This stone-headed *+2 striking [[Returning]] [[Javelin]]* draws forth the power of the earth itself to strike at enemies.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You hurl the *stoneraiser javelin* at an unoccupied space within 30 feet. The javelin’s power flows into the ground, which erupts in a 5-foot-radius burst of razor-sharp stalagmites. The stalagmites are 10 feet tall. Everything on each side of the stalagmites has cover from creatures on the opposite side, and the stalagmites’ spaces are difficult terrain. A creature takes 4d4 piercing damage for every move action it takes that enters at least one of the affected spaces. Each 5-foot-by-5-foot section has AC 10, Hardness 14, and 30 Hit Points. It’s immune to critical hits and precision damage. A destroyed section can be moved through freely. The stalagmites crumble to dust after 1 minute.Any creature in the area when the stalagmites appear is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space of its choice; this movement is [[Forced Movement]]. Pushed creatures must attempt a DC 28 Reflex saving throw or take 4d4 piercing damage.
