# Ouroboros Flail

**Item 14+**

> You can easily expand and contract the chain of this *+2 [[Greater Striking]] [[Extending]] [[War Flail]]*. It magically grows new links when extended and loses them when contracted.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬲{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Trigger**: You successfully Strike with the flail while activating its *extending* rune;
**Effect**: The head of the flail wraps around the target of the triggering Strike and drags it in your direction. The target must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save or be [[Pulled]] adjacent to you. A creature pulled in is then [[Grabbed]] by the flail until the end of your next turn unless you move, your target [[Escapes]] (DC 31), or you use the flail.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬽{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Effect**: You extend the flail's chain, then wrap it across itself and strike two links together. This severs a usable 60-foot loop of chain from the flail, which instantly returns to its normal length. If you use this activation again, any previous chain you created with it disappears after 1 round. As with most obviously magical and temporary constructs, the chain cannot be sold.
