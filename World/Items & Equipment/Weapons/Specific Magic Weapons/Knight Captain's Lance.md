# Knight Captain's Lance

**Item 13**

> The appearance of this beautifully crafted *+2 [[Disrupting]] [[Greater Striking]] [[Lance]]* changes to match the armor of its wielder. It has a cloth flag attached behind the lance point that displays whatever heraldry the wielder wishes. If a cavalier with the [[Cavalier'S Banner]] feat takes the knight captain's lance, it instead automatically displays the banner of their pledge.
