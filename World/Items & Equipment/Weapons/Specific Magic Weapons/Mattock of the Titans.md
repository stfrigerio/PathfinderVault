# Mattock of the Titans

**Item 19**

> This 15-foot-long [[Adamantine]] digging tool is far too big for even a Large creature to wield, though if you’re a Small or larger creature, you can wield it while wearing a *[[Nethys/Apex Items/Belt of Giant Strength]]*, as though it were appropriately sized for you and had 2 Bulk. The GM might also allow you to wield the mattock if you have some other means of wielding oversized weapons, such as if you’re a Large barbarian with the [[Giant Instinct]] or are a Huge creature. When it’s used as a weapon, the *mattock of the titans* has the statistics of a *+3 greater striking [[Keen]] adamantine [[Greatpick]]*.While you’re wielding the *mattock of the titans* , you gain a +3 item bonus to [[Athletics]] checks. You can use it to loosen or push soft earth at a rate of 1 minute per 5-foot cube or smash through solid stone at the rate of 5 minutes per 5-foot-cube.
