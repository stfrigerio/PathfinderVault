# Blade of the Black Sovereign

**Item 15**

> This *+2 [[Greater Striking]] [[Shock]] [[Greatsword]]* is forged from [[Standard-Grade Adamantine]], with inlays of broken circuitry and a robot's ocular lens on the cross guard. A soft thrum comes from the blade, which you feel as a subtle pulse through the grip when wielding it. It sparks when unsheathed, emitting dim light within 5 feet. On a hit against a foe made of metal, wearing metal armor, or using a metal shield, if the foe takes electricity damage from the blade, the makes the foe [[Flat-Footed]] for 1 round; if the Strike was a critical hit, it also makes them [[Clumsy 1]] for 1 round.
