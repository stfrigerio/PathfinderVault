# Glaive of the Artist

**Item 14**

> This *+2 [[Holy]] greater striking [[Glaive]]* has a long, multi-tailed rainbow-colored banner affixed to the butt of the pole in the style of [[Shelyn’S]] religious symbol. While wielding the glaive, you gain a +2 item bonus on [[Crafting]] and [[Performance]] checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per round;
**Effect**: You furl one of the colored tails around the pole, causing the glaive to gain the effects of your choice of the *[[Corrosive]]*, *[[Flaming]]*, *[[Frost]]*, *[[Shocking]]*, or *[[Thundering]]* property runes for 1 round, depending on the tail you chose.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You thrust the blade of the glaive into the ground, activating the power of the banner. (The blade can penetrate any non-metallic surface when used in this way, and does not leave a mark when withdrawn.) As long as the glaive is thrust into the ground and standing upright, all allies within 60 feet who can see the glaive’s banner gain a +2 item bonus to Performance checks.
