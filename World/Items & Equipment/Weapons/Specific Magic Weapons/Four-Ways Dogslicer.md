# Four-Ways Dogslicer

**Item 12**

> This *+2 [[Striking]] [[Dogslicer]]* is obviously the work of a brilliant but scrappy artisan who valued versatility over safety. Four toothy gems line the blade's cutting edge, three of which glow—one with fiery red light, one with a chill blue, and one that gives off sparks—while the last is a glistening black. Each of these gems embodies a weapon property rune, but only one rune can be active at a time.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Effect**: You twist the gem along the blade corresponding with the desired weapon rune: red for *[[Flaming]]*, blue for *[[Frost]]*, or yellow for *[[Shock]]*. You take 1d6 damage of the type the chosen rune deals. You can instead twist the black gem to disable the active property rune, taking no damage.

```
