# Solar Shellflower

**Item 5**

> This *+1 [[Striking]] [[Flintlock Musket]]* features multiple triangular panels that can be folded out of the stock, like the petals of a tigridia flower, that collect sunlight and feed it into the spark gun's core. All damage dealt by a *solar shellflower* is fire damage.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day (but see below);
**Effect**: One of the panels from the *solar shellflower* detaches and unfurls into a tigridia-shaped construct of flame. For the next 1 minute, whenever you Strike an enemy with the *solar shellflower* , the construct fires a smaller jet of fire that automatically hits the target, dealing 3d4 additional [[Persistent Fire Damage]] or twice that on a critical hit. The *solar shellflower* usually requires a full day to replenish enough solar energy to recharge this Activation, but if used in an environment with especially strong sunlight, such as in a desert, cliff above the clouds, or near the summer solstice, it can recharge in 1 hour instead.
