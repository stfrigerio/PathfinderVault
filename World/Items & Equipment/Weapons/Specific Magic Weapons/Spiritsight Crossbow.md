# Spiritsight Crossbow

**Item 8**

> This *+1 [[Striking]] [[Ghost Touch]] [[Crossbow]]* has an array of crystalline lenses and silver fittings along the stock and feels strangely light.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per minute;
**Effect**: You aim through the crossbow's crystalline lenses, gaining [[Imprecise Vision]] onto the [[Ethereal Plane]] with a range of 60 feet in addition to your normal senses for the rest of your turn. While this effect lasts, your next Strike with the *spiritsight crossbow* can also affect targets on the Ethereal Plane during the first 60 feet of its flight.
