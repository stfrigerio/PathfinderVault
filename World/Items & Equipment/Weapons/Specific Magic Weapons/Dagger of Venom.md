# Dagger of Venom

**Item 5**

> The serrated blade of this *+1 striking [[Dagger]]* has a greenish tinge, and the hilt is sculpted to look like the head of a serpent about to strike. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with the *dagger of venom* , the target becomes [[Sickened 1]] unless it succeeds at a DC 19 Fortitude save. This is a [[Poison]] effect. In addition, you can activate the dagger to poison a creature with a more potent poison.
