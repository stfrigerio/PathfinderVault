# Fulminating Spear

**Item 7**

> This *+1 [[Striking]] [[Returning]] [[Spear]]* is warm to the touch. The head of the spear is crafted from gold with ivory inlay and has a ruby set into the shaft. You can make the spear glow like a [[Torch]] or suppress its light by using an action, which has the [[Concentrate]] trait.

```ad-embed-ability

*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* envision, Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You touch the ruby and hurl the spear at a square within 40 feet. When the spear lands, it detonates, dealing 6d6 fire damage (DC 23 [[Basic]] Reflex save) to all creatures in a 10-foot emanation. It then flies back to your hand.
