# Cooperative Blade

**Item 6**

> This *+1 [[Striking]] [[Longsword]]* has a mirror-like blade free of tarnish despite being millennia old. While wielding it, you gain a +2 item bonus to checks to [[Aid]]. If you're an expert with the skill or attack roll you're using to Aid and you critically succeed, you grant your ally a +3 circumstance bonus to the triggering check instead of a +2 bonus.
