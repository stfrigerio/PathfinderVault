# Flaying Knife

**Item 8**

> This long, thin *+1 [[Striking]] [[Wounding]] [[Dagger]]* has a smooth edge on one side and a serrated edge on the other. Its [[Persistent Bleed Damage]] comes from slicing away long strips of the target's flesh, and it deals 1d8 persistent bleed damage on a hit instead of 1d6. A creature takes a â€“2 status penalty to saving throws against [[Diseases]] for as long as it has persistent bleed damage from this knife.
