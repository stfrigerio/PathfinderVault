# Stargazer

**Item 14**

> When you invest this *[[Clear Quartz Crystal Ball]]*, it orbits your head like an *[[Aeon Stone]]*. As long as you have the *stargazer* invested, you can use an Interact action to direct it to orbit one of your hands where you can telekinetically smash the orb into foes, wielding it as a *+2 [[Greater Striking]] [[Returning]] [[Club]]*. While you're directing the *stargazer* , your hand is full, and you can send it back to your head with another Interact action. On a critical hit, the *stargazer* pulses with hypnotic starlight, [[Dazzling]] the struck creature for 1 round. A stargazer doesn't add [[Critical Specialization Effects]].
