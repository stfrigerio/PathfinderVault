# Sky-Piercing Bow

**Item 19**

> Large turquoise gems stud the outer edge of this sturdy *+3 [[Greater Striking]] [[Ghost Touch]] [[Composite Shortbow]]*. Arrows shot from the bow are unimpaired by wind and air effects.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* Interact ([[Conjuration]] [[Teleportation]]) 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You shoot an arrow at an open space on a surface within 500 feet and momentarily vanish into a wind that carries the arrow. You teleport to that location.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact ([[Electricity]]) 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You shoot an arrow at the sky and it tears an extraplanar rift that resembles a storm cloud in a 30-foot burst centered on a point within 200 feet. A torrent of rain pours down from the rift for 1 minute or until you Dismiss the effect. The area within the torrent becomes difficult terrain for all movement (including [[Flying]] ). As an Interact action, you can fire an arrow into the rift to cause a bolt of lightning to strike a creature in the area. The creature takes 5d12 lightning damage and must attempt a DC 41 [[Basic]] Reflex save.
