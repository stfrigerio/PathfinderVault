# Soul Chain

**Item 6**

> A soul chain is a *+1 [[Striking]] [[Spiked Chain]]* that has become cursed after a [[Forge-Spurned]] used it to kill a creature and trap its soul. In the hands of a forge-spurned, a soul chain inflicts an additional 1d6 fire damage on a hit. Other creatures can use a *soul chain* as a standard *+1 striking spiked chain*. A *soul chain* fuses with its wielder the first time the wielder damages a living creature with the weapon. A character who dies while carrying a *soul chain* must attempt a DC 20 Will save; on a failure, they're immediately transformed into a forge-spurned. Carrying multiple soul chains doesn't increase the DC of the save, but the carrier must attempt the save once for each chain they carry.
