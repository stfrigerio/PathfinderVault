# Sparkblade

**Item 3**

> Faint, delicate etchings of lightning trace across the blade of this *+1 [[Cold Iron]] [[Shortsword]]*. Cold iron is made from particularly pure sources of iron and shaped with little to no heat, resulting in weapons deadly to [[Demons]] and [[Fey]] alike. Once per day, you can spend 1 action to point the *sparkblade* at a foe within 30 feet of you and shoot an arc of lightning from the blade. This lightning can leap from your chosen foe to another creature you choose within 30 feet, dealing 2d4+4 electricity damage to each creature (DC 19 basic Reflex save).
