# Scizore of the Crab

**Item 5**

> A *scizore of the crab* is a *+1 [[Scizore]]* that has the [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Grapple]] trait in addition to its normal weapon traits.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Requirements**: Your last action was a successful Strike with this weapon, or you have a creature [[Grabbed]] with this weapon;
**Effect**: The target is grabbed until the end of your next turn. A grabbed creature can use the [[Escape]] action to get out of the Grab, and the Grab ends for a grabbed creature if you move away from it. This functions as the [[Grab]] creature ability.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per round;
**Requirements**: You have a creature [[Grabbed]] with this weapon;
**Effect**: The crab claw animates and pinches open and shut, dealing slashing damage equal to the *scizore of the crab's* number of damage dice.

```
