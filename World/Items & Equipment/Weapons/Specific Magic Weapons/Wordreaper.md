# Wordreaper

**Item 3**

> The blade of this *+1 [[Sickle]]* is engraved to look like the curving feather of a particularly elaborate quill. The wooden handle has a pen nib at the base. You can use the *wordreaper's* handle as an ink pen and it never runs out of ink.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬽{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You use the *wordreaper* to inscribe the words “read by” and your name inside a non-magical literary work (such as a non-magical book, scroll, or play). You immediately gain cursory knowledge of the literary work as though you had skimmed it for 5 minutes.
