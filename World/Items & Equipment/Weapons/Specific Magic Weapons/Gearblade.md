# Gearblade

**Item 17**

> Shaped like a blade made from spinning gears, this *+2 [[Greater Striking]] weapon* can catch enemy weapons and grind up foes. In order to function, the *gearblade* must be wound for 10 minutes once every 24 hours. During this process, you can reconfigure the weapon to transform into a [[Bastard Sword]], [[Greatsword]], [[Longsword]], or [[Shortsword]]. It then gains all the features of the chosen weapon except that its Bulk is always 2 and it gains the [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Disarm]] weapon trait and the [[Versatile B]] weapon trait (which replaces any other versatile trait the weapon might have). If you don't wind the *gearblade* , it becomes inert and has the statistics of a [[Greatclub]].

**Frequency**: once per day;
**Trigger**: You roll a critical success to [[Disarm]] a target with the *gearblade*;
**Requirements**: You've wound the *gearblade* for 10 minutes within the last 24 hours;
**Effect**: The target's weapon is pulled through the *gearblade's* gears and shoots out the other side, landing 20 feet away in a direction of your choice. The target must attempt a DC 36 Reflex save. On a failure, the limb holding their weapon is also pulled into the *gearblade* , and the creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage. On a critical failure, they take 6d12 bludgeoning damage and the limb becomes unusable until healed by a *[[Regenerate]]* spell or a similar effect.
