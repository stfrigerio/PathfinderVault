# Hex Blaster

**Item 11**

> This *+2 [[Striking]] [[Fearsome]] [[Arquebus]]* is composed of warped and twisted wood engraved with eerie runes. When the weapon fires, the blast sometimes sounds like the cackling of a diabolical witch.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You afflict a creature you can see with a hex of *impending doom*. The hex lasts for 1 minute. As long as the creature is hexed, when you hit it with a round from the hex blaster, the creature must attempt a DC 28 Will save at the end of your turn; the creature attempts a single Will save regardless of the number of times you hit it.

```
