# Undead Scourge

**Item 7**

> An undead scourge is a *+1 [[Striking]] [[Disrupting]] [[Dagger]]* with a bluish-white metal blade that emits a faint glow. These used to be weapons of [[Pharasmin]] undead slayers only, but the slayers have since shared these daggers with the Knights of Lastwall.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â­“{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Trigger**: You damage an [[Undead]] creature with the *undead scourge*;
**Effect**: You disrupt the undead's connection to negative energy. For 1 minute, the undead damaged with the dagger can't be healed by negative energy unless the effect attempting to heal the undead first [[Counteracts]] the *undead scourge's* effect, with a counteract level of 4 and DC of 25. Positive energy still has the usual effects on the undead.
