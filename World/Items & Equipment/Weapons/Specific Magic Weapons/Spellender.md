**Item 9**

> This knife is a *+1 [[Striking]] [[Returning]] [[Dagger]]* with a wide blade and thick wooden handle. A prayer for protection from evil magic is carved into the handle in tiny script, running around the handle in a spiral. The grooves of the carved prayer provide a good grip on the knife and make it easy to catch when it returns to your hand.
