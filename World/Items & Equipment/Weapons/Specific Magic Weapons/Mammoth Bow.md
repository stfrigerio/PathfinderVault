# Mammoth Bow

**Item 12**

> This heavy, 12-foot-tall *+2 [[Striking]] [[Composite Longbow]]* is fashioned from mammoth tusks lashed together. Due to its great size, you can attack with the *Mammoth Bow* only if you're Large or larger. The *Mammoth Bow* deals 2d6 additional piercing damage because of its incredible, magically enhanced draw power. Additionally, the Mammoth Bow has a 180-foot [[Range Increment]] instead of a 100-foot range increment, but its [[Volley]] range increases from 30 feet to 50 feet.
