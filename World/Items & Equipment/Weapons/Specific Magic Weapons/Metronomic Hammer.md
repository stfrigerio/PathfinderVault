# Metronomic Hammer

**Item 5**

> A polished brass metronome ticks rhythmically within the haft of this *+1 [[Striking]] [[Gnome Hooked Hammer]]*. Gnome adherents of [[Brigh]] often attempt to reproduce this item as part of a ritual symbolizing methodical problem-solving and thoughtful craftsmanship.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬²{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Trigger**: You attempt to [[Trip]] a creature with the *metronomic hammer*;
**Effect**: By timing the sweeping arcs of your Trip attempt to the built-in metronome of a *metronomic hammer* , you gain a +1 item bonus to your [[Athletics]] check to Trip the target. This item bonus increases by 1 with every subsequent Trip attempt you make with the *metronomic hammer* against the same target this turn, to a maximum of +3 on your third Trip. The bonus resets to +1 if you successfully Trip the target, if you critically fail to Trip the target, or if your turn ends.
