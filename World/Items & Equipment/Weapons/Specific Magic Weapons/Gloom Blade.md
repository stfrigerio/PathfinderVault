# Gloom Blade

**Item 9**

> As black as coal, this blade grows more potent in darkness. While in bright light, it functions as a *+1 [[Shortsword]]* and doesn’t appear to radiate a magic aura to *[[Detect Magic]]* or similar spells unless the spells are 4th level or higher.In dim light or darkness, the *gloom blade* becomes a *+2 striking shortsword*. Whenever you use the *gloom blade* to attack a creature you’re [[Undetected]] by, you deal 1d6 additional precision damage.To upgrade the *gloom blade’s* fundamental runes, start with the base *+1 shortsword* , but if you improve it beyond a *+2 striking shortsword* , the runes apply in dim light or darkness as well.
