# Frost Brand

**Item 16**

> The blade of this *+2 greater striking [[Greater Frost]] [[Greatsword]]* appears to be nothing but icy shards. The *frost brand* automatically extinguishes non-magical fires in a 20-foot emanation. While wielding it, you gain fire resistance 5.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact; 
**Effect**: You swing the *frost brand* into the area of an ongoing magical fire, and the blade attempts to [[Counteract]] the fire with a counteract modifier of +27. If it fails, it can't attempt to counteract the same fire again.

```
