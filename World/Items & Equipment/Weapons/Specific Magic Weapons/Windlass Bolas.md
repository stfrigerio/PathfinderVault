# Windlass Bolas

**Item 6**

> Clockwork mechanisms tick away inside the weights of these *+1 [[Striking]] [[Returning]] [[Bolas]]* , spooling out more cord in midair.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: The cord of the bola snakes out as you throw it, allowing the weapon to wrap around a group of enemies. You use the bolas to attempt a ranged [[Trip]] against all creatures in a 5-foot radius burst within the weapon's first range increment. Roll a separate [[Athletics]] check for each target. Each attempt counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you have made all the attempts.

```
