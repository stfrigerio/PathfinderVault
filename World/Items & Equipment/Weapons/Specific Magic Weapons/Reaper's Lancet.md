# Reaper's Lancet

**Item 5**

> Hendrid Pratchett himself designed this custom skull-topped *+1 [[Striking]] [[Exquisite Sword Cane]]* and had it gilded in high-quality gold. Its first victim was the very smith whom Pratchett commissioned to craft the weapon, so the means of its construction are a secret known only to Pratchett. The magic of the *Reaper's Lancet* applies to both the blade and the sheath, making them each effectively a *+1 striking weapon* , but only if both are wielded by the same creature—if the two components are shared between creatures, only the blade retains the rune's magic. *Reaper's Lancet* has a hidden reservoir inside the skull that automatically applies a new dose of poison to the blade after the previous dose was expended with a successful Strike. The reservoir must be filled manually (a process requiring 1 minute) and is large enough to hold only 3 doses at a time. Any sort of [[Injury]] -delivered poison can be placed in it, though all doses must be of the same poison. The Price of the poison is not reflected in this weapon's listed Price.
