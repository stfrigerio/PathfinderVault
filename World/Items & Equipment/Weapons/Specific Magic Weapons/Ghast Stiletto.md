# Ghast Stiletto

**Item 3**

> A *ghast stiletto* is a *+1 [[Dagger]]* wrapped in the still-undead skin of a [[Ghast]]. While you wield the dagger, you gain a +1 status bonus to all saves against [[Paralysis]].

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact ([[Divine]] [[Necromancy]] [[Olfactory]]) 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: The *ghast stiletto* afflicts the next living target struck by the dagger with a terrible wound that emits the foul stench of the grave. For the next minute, the target creature, as well as any creatures within a 10-foot emanation, must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become [[Sickened 1]] (plus [[Slowed 1]] as long as it's sickened on a critical failure). While within the emanation, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.

```

**Craft Requirements**: The initial raw materials must include skin from a ghast.
