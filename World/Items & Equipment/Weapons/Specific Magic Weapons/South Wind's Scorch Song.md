# South Wind's Scorch Song

**Item 10**

> This *+1 [[Striking]] [[Flaming]] [[Scimitar]]* is always warm to the touch, nearly unbearably so. Lines of crackling flame radiate from carnelians affixed to its curved and blackened blade, and its pommel ends in a brilliant tassel of [[Phoenix]] feathers. While you have a status bonus to at least one of your Speeds, your Strikes with this scimitar that deal fire damage gain a +2 status bonus to their fire damage. The status bonus increases to +3 if the weapon has a *greater striking* rune and +4 for *major striking*.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â­“{.Pathfinder }* command ([[Evocation]] [[Fire]] [[Magical]]) 
**Trigger**: Your spell deals fire damage to a creature;
**Effect**: You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed until the end of your next turn.
