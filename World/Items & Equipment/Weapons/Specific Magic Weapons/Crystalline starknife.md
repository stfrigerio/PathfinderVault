> A ***crystalline starknife*** looks like crystal but is as hard as steel. This [[Starknife|starknife]] is particularly effective against crystalline creatures. When thrown in the right light, it looks like a spinning disk of prismatic color; those hit under these circumstances often become dazzled by the colors. When thrown by a worshiper of [[Desna]], it automatically returns to its wielder.
> The original *crystalline starknife* was wielded by Nugloss, a priestess of Desna who fought for the [[Linnorm King|Linnorm Kings]] during the [[Winter War]].
