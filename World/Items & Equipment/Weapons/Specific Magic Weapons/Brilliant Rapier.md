# Brilliant Rapier

**Item 14**

> This *+2 [[Brilliant]] [[Greater Striking]] [[Rapier]]* is formed entirely out of radiant energy, even more so than a usual *brilliant* weapon, and has left its physical form behind entirely. Instead of dealing piercing damage, it deals fire damage, and in addition to a rapier's normal weapon traits, it gains the [[Versatile Good Or Positive Trait]].
