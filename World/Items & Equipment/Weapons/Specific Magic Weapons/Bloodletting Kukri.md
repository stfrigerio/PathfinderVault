# Bloodletting Kukri

**Item 6**

> This *+1 striking [[Kukri]]* has a crimson blade that shimmers eerily in bright light. On a critical hit, the kukri deals 1d8 [[Persistent Bleed Damage]]. If the target didnâ€™t already have persistent bleed damage when you scored the critical hit, you also gain 1d8 temporary Hit Points.
