# Dwarven Thrower

**Item 13**

> This *+2 striking [[Warhammer]]* is inlaid with precious metals and decorated with geometric patterns in a dwarven style. If youâ€™re a [[Dwarf]], a *dwarven thrower* functions for you as a *+2 greater striking [[Returning]] warhammer* with the [[Thrown 30 Feet]] trait, and your attacks with the hammer deal 1d8 additional damage against [[Giants]].
