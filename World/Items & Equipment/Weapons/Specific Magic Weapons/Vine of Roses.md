# Vine of Roses

**Item 9**

> This *+1 [[Striking]] [[Disrupting]] [[Spiked Chain]]* comes in a rich, green color with rose petals painted on the handle in varying shades of red and pink. The chain seems to banish nearby shadows.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Effect**: You hold the chain out before you, and the weapon glows as bright as a [[Torch]]. You can suppress this light by Activating the weapon again.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬲{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Trigger**: You critically succeed at a Strike against a [[Fiend]] or [[Undead]] ;
**Effect**: The weapon unleashes its light in an attempt to destroy the target. The *vine of roses* casts a 3rd-level *[[Searing Light]]* spell with the triggering creature as the target. In place of a spell attack roll, make a weapon attack roll with the *vine of roses* using the same multiple attack penalty as the triggering Strike.

```
