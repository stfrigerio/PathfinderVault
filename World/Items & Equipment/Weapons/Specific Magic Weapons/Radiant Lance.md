# Radiant Lance

**Item 15**

> When wielded in battle, these silver lances blaze with light. A radiant lance is a *+2 greater striking [[Holy]] [[Flaming]] [[Silver]] [[Lance]]*. When wielded in battle, the radiant lance sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius. On a hit against an undead creature that is specifically vulnerable to sunlight, the lance bursts with a brilliant flash of light, and that undead must attempt a DC 35 Fortitude save. If the attack was a critical hit, the undead uses an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw.
**Success**: The undead is unaffected.
**Failure**: The undead is slowed 1 for 1 round.
**Critical Failure**: The undead is slowed 1 for 1 minute.
