# Holy Avenger

**Item 14**

> The gleaming *holy avenger* is the iconic weapon of powerful [[Paladins]]. The crossbar of this *+2 greater striking [[Holy]] [[Cold Iron]] [[Longsword]]* is styled to look like angel wings. Tradition holds that those who see their reflection in a *holy avenger's* highly polished blade have their faults laid bare. If you are evil, you are [[Enfeebled 2]] while carrying or wielding this weapon.

**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You command the sword and point it at a creature you can see. The sword casts *[[Detect Alignment]]* to detect evil, but this targets only the selected creature instead of detecting in an area.
