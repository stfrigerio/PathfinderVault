# Buzzsaw Axe

**Item 11+**

> With an aerodynamic cutting edge and a curved handle, this *+2 [[Striking]] [[Battle Axe]]* is perfectly suited to whirling motions, and in fact seems like it wants to whirl free from your grip. A Strike with this axe that benefits from the [[Sweep]] trait's circumstance bonus on attack rolls also gains a +2 circumstance bonus to the damage roll.

```ad-embed-ability

*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You hurl the axe, which spins at great speed as it flies to a distant point and returns to you, leaving a trail of carnage. Each creature in a 120-foot line must succeed at a DC 28 [[Basic]] Reflex save or take damage equal to the weapon's melee damage, including your Strength modifier.
