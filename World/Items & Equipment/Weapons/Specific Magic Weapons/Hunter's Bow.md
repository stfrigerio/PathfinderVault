# Hunter's Bow

**Item 3**

> Stealthy hunters and rogues can use this *+1 magic [[Shortbow]]* to attack from hiding. If you use this bow to Strike a target that can't see you and you get a critical hit, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage (this is in addition to sneak attack damage if you're a rogue).
