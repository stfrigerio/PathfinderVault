# Grisly Scythe

**Item 9**

> While this sinister-looking weapon isn't inherently evil, its unsettling appearance and powers particularly appeal to those who revel in causing pain. A *grisly scythe* has a twisted thorny haft and a blade that appears to be rusted, but it functions as a *+1 [[Striking]] [[Wounding]] [[Scythe]]*.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬²{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Trigger**: Your attack roll with the *grisly scythe* is a critical success;
**Effect**: Instead of inflicting slashing damage with the grisly scythe, you inflict negative damage. You regain a number of hit points equal to half the negative damage inflicted, and the creature struck becomes [[Sickened 1]] from the agony.

```
