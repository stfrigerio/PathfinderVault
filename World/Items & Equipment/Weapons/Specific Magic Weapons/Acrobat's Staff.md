# Acrobat's Staff

**Item 6**

> This *+1 striking [[Bo Staff]]* is particularly long, making it useful as a balancing pole. While you wield it, the acrobat’s staff releases chalk dust to make your grip more secure, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC against checks to [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Disarm]] you of it.

```ad-embed-ability

**Effect**: Reroll the Acrobatics check and take the better result.
