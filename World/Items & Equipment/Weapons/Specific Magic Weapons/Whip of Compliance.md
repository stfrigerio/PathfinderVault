# Whip of Compliance

**Item 9**

> The handle of this braided leather *+1 striking [[Whip]]* is made from the hairs of a variety of rare and mythical animals. When used against an animal, the *whip of compliance* can potentially force the target to follow your commands.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Effect**: Until the end of your current turn, any animals you Strike with the whip must attempt a DC 25 Will save. On a failed or critically failed saving throw, the whip casts a 4th-level *[[Suggestion]]* spell on the animal with a base duration of 1 round, and the spell loses the [[Linguistic]] trait. The course of action must still fulfill *suggestion’s* requirements. If you can cast spells, you can expend one of your spells of 4th level or higher as a part of activating the whip; if you do so, the *suggestions* this turn have their normal base duration.

```
