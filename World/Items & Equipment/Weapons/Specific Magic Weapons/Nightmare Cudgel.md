# Nightmare Cudgel

**Item 11**

> Crafted from polished wood, this seemingly mundane *+1 [[Striking]] [[Club]]* comes with a red leather strap near the handle. The mere sight of the cudgel in a guard's hand fills prisoners with dread. Good creatures are [[Enfeebled 2]] while carrying, wielding, or wearing this item crafted by the sea-witches.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* Interact ([[Emotion]] [[Mental]]) 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You initiate an intimidating walk, thumping the cudgel menacingly against your palm. As part of activating this item, you can Stride twice. For the next minute, whenever you successfully Strike a creature with the *nightmare cudgel* , you can use a free action to attempt an [[Intimidation]] check to [[Demoralize]] the struck creature.
