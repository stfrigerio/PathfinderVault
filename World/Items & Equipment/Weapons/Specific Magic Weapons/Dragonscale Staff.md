# Dragonscale Staff

**Item 6**

>  *Nethys Note: This item is named "Dragonscale Staff" in* Treasure Vault *. To prevent it from being confused with the [[]]*  [[Dragonscale Staff *]]*  *, we've renamed it pending any errata Paizo makes.* This *+1 [[Striking]] [[Bo Staff]]* is covered in scales shed by or harvested from a [[Dragon]]. When benefiting from the circumstance bonus to AC granted by the bo staff's [[Parry]] trait, you also gain resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison, according to the type of damage dealt by the breath weapon of the dragon that provided the scales; for instance, a staff made with scales taken from a [[White Dragon]] would provide cold resistance. When this resistance prevents you from taking damage, the *dragonscale staff* deals an additional 1 damage of the type matching its resistance for 1 round.
**Craft Requirements**: The initial raw materials must include scales from a dragon with a breath weapon that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage.
