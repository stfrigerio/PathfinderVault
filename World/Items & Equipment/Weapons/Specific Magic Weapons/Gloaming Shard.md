# Gloaming Shard

**Item 11**

> The blade of this *+2 [[Striking]] [[Returning]] [[Dagger]]* shines the color of twilight, with a triangular lattice design on the hilt. A thin string of darkness connects your shadow to that of the blade, even once it leaves your hand.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* Interact ([[Shadow]] [[Teleportation]]) 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You make a [[Thrown]] Strike with the *gloaming shard* at a target within 60 feet. Whether you hit or miss, rather than returning to you, the blade pulls you down into your own shadow and along the connecting thread. You instantly teleport to a space adjacent to the target of your Strike, as *[[Dimension Door]]*, and then catch the dagger in your hand.
