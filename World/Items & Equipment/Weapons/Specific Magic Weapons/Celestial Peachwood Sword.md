# Celestial Peachwood Sword

**Item 17**

> From blade to pommel, this sword is carved from a branch of the now-extinct celestial peach tree. The blade of this *+3 [[Greater Striking]] [[Disrupting]] [[Holy]] [[Peachwood]] [[Shortsword]]* has ancient runes that can permanently destroy the most powerful [[Undead]] —if you are willing to pay the price. An undead creature of 12th level or lower that takes damage from a Strike with the sword takes 10d6 positive damage (DC 35 [[Basic]] Fortitude save). This damage is separate from the Strike itself and isn't included in any effect based on the Strike's damage.

**Trigger**: You critically hit an undead creature with the *celestial peachwood sword*;
**Requirements**: once per day;
**Effect**: The creature must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or be destroyed. If the undead fails its saving throw and is destroyed, you suffer a backlash, taking 1d6 negative damage per level of the destroyed undead.
