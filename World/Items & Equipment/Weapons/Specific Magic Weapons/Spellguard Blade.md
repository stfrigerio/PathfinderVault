# Spellguard Blade

**Item 7**

> The guard of this *+1 [[Striking]] [[Main-Gauche]]* is inscribed with eldritch glyphs that guard against magic. When you are benefiting from the +1 circumstance bonus to AC from this weapon's [[Parry]] trait, you also apply that circumstance bonus to your saving throws against spells that target you.
