# Thundercrasher

**Item 5**

> While looking straight down the barrel of this *+1 [[Striking]] [[World/Items & Equipment/Weapons/Guns/Blunderbuss]]* , the spark gun's magical core is visible amid several reflectors. All damage dealt by a *thundercrasher* is sonic damage. On a critical hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[Deafened]] for 1 minute.

*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You overload the *thundercrasher* to emit chaotic sonic frequencies that soften earth and stone. When you next fire the *thundercrasher* it also partially liquefies any natural earth or stone surfaces within range of its [[Scatter]] trait, making the area difficult terrain
