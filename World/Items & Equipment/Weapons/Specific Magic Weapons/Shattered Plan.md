# Shattered Plan

**Item 11**

> Though the body of this *+2 [[Striking]] [[Impactful]] [[Boomerang]]* is riddled with glowing hairline cracks, the weapon feels reassuringly solid in the hand. If you damage a target that has been struck by a *[[Rime Foil]]* within the last round, you bruise its chilled body, and the target takes a –5-foot penalty to all its Speeds, or a –10-foot penalty on a critical hit.
**Special**: The *shattered plan* pairs with the *rime foil*.
