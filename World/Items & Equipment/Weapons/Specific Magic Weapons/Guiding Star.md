# Guiding Star

**Item 7**

> This *+1 [[Striking]] [[Returning]] [[Starknife]]* is made of dark blue metal overlaid with smoky flecks of fused quartz. When you Cast an [[Magic/Evocation]] Spell, your next attack this turn with this starknife reduces the target's cover, changing greater cover to standard cover or ignoring standard and lesser cover.

**Frequency**: once per 10 minutes;
**Trigger**: You successfully Strike a creature with a [[Thrown]] Strike with *guiding star*;
**Effect**: Soft light outlines the target. At the beginning of your next turn, the *guiding star's* blades detach and form into darts of starlight, flying up to 40 feet and striking the target unerringly, collectively dealing 4 piercing damage and 1 good damage before re-forming. The piercing damage increases to 6 with a *greater striking rune* and 8 with a *major striking rune*.
