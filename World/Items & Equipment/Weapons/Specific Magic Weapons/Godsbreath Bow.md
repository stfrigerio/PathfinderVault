# Godsbreath Bow

**Item 15**

> This *+2 [[Greater Striking]] [[Composite Shortbow]]* is made from wood, horn, and sinew. Once wielded by Ninshaburian heretics, it's carried in a leather case etched with images of Namzaruum in combat with [[Somnalu]]. On a successful Strike, it deals an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You make a ranged Strike. On a hit, a vortex of air trails the arrow as it travels. When the arrow strikes its target, the vortex expands to a 30-foot radius from its point of impact. The arrow deals an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage against its target. For the next 3 minutes, any physical ranged attacks that would strike a target within the vortex deal an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage. The vortex is difficult terrain, and creatures attempting to fly through the vortex using a [[Move]] action must attempt a DC 34 Fortitude save, losing its move action on a failed save. Any gases within the vortex are cleared by the winds.
