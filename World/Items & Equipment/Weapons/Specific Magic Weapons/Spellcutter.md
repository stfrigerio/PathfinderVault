# Spellcutter

**Item 17**

> The blade of this *+2 [[Greater Striking]] [[Adamantine]] [[Longsword]]* seems to absorb light from the air around it, giving the impression the wielder is standing in the shadow of a much larger creature. While *Spellcutter* is a potent weapon for battling [[Undead]] and [[Constructs]], an ancient restriction on the blade prevents it from harming living creatures; attacks against living beings deal no damage. This restriction doesn't apply to [[Dhampirs]] or creatures with the [[Negative Healing]] ability who are otherwise living; the magic of the blade can't distinguish between such beings and undead.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬲{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Trigger**: You're targeted by a spell while wielding *Spellcutter*;
**Effect**:  *Spellcutter* attempts to absorb the magic of the triggering spell, giving you a +4 status bonus to your AC and saves against the effect.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Effect**: Touching *Spellcutter* to any light source of 12th level or lower (including 6th-level spells with the [[Light]] trait) instantly extinguishes the effect. If the source of the light is a large flame, such as a forest fire or bonfire, it only extinguishes the light source in a 5-foot radius burst from the point of contact.
