# Final Rest

**Item 18**

> This *+3 [[Greater Disrupting]] [[Greater Striking]] [[Silver]] [[Longsword]]* is made from the purest silver. The blade is carefully etched to depict a vast and sprawling necropolis, a place where the dead are laid to rest. Whenever you critically hit an [[Undead]] creature with *final rest* , the undead creature takes 3d6 [[Persistent Good Damage]], with a DC 36 Fortitude save.
**Critical Success**: No effect.
**Success**: The creature takes half the persistent good damage.
**Failure**: The creature is [[Stunned 1]] and takes the full persistent good damage.
**Critical Failure**: The creature is stunned 3 and takes double the persistent good damage.

```
