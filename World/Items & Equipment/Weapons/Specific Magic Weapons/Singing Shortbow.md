# Singing Shortbow

**Item 14+**

> Rather than a normal bowstring, this *+2 [[Greater Striking]] [[Thundering]] [[Composite Shortbow]]* has a string made of animal gut, much like a musical instrument's. When you shoot the bow, it releases a soft musical note—sonorous if your aim is true and discordant if your shot goes off-target.

title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* command ([[Auditory]]) 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You sing, hum, or whistle a note, and your bow provides appropriate accompaniment. Make a Strike with the bow. If it hits, the bow generates a magical effect determined by the note you sung, which has the traits indicated in parentheses. This affects every creature in a 10-foot emanation from the creature you hit. As normal for an emanation, you choose whether the creature you hit is affected.
