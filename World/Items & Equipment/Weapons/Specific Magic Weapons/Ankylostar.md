# Ankylostar

**Item 13**

> This hefty spiked club is made from the fossilized tail-club of a young ankylosaurus. It can be wielded as a *+2 greater striking [[Morningstar]]*.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Effect**: The *ankylostar* grows and transforms into a *+2 greater striking greatclub* , but it retains the [[Versatile (Piercing)]] trait of a morningstar. While in this form, the *ankylostar* has Bulk 2 and requires two hands to wield. It can be returned to its morningstar form with another 1-action command.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Requirements**: The *ankylostar* is in its greatclub form;
**Effect**: The *ankylostar’s* length extends as you swing the club in a wide arc. You Strike up to three creatures in a 15-foot cone; this counts as one attack for the purpose of calculating your multiple attack penalty. Alternatively, you [[Shove]] up to three creatures in a 15-foot cone, rolling a separate [[Athletics]] check for each creature.
