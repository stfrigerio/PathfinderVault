# Alicorn Lance

**Item 5**

> This white *+1 [[Striking]] [[Lance]]* is made from the horn of a [[Unicorn]], willingly granted at the end of its lifetime. In addition to its normal damage, it deals 1 good damage on successful attacks. You can make the lance glow like a [[Torch]] or suppress its light by using an action, which has the [[Concentrate]] trait.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* Interact ([[Magical]] [[Necromancy]]) 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: You evoke the spirit of the unicorn that donated the *alicorn lance's* horn, which you ride in a shining charge. Move up to twice your Speed and make a Strike with the *alicorn lance*; you gain the effects of the lance's [[Jousting]] trait on this Strike. If you were already mounted when you Activate the horn, the unicorn spirit takes shape around your steed, granting it a +10–foot status bonus to its Speed for the charge.

```

**Craft Requirements**: The initial raw materials must include a horn willingly gifted by a unicorn. In rare instances, an *alicorn lance* can be made with a forcibly taken horn. However this heinous act pollutes the horn's magic, causing it to glow with a sickly red light, deal evil damage instead of good damage, and make the unicorn spirit evoked in the charge to whinny visibly in pain.
