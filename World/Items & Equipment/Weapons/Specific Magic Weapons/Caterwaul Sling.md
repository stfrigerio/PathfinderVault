# Caterwaul Sling

**Item 5**

> Made of shiny brown leather, this *+1 striking [[Sling]]* has a single white thread interwoven into its cord.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* Interact (sonic); 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You pull the white thread free, then whirl the sling in circles at high speed. It lets out an ear-piercing wave of sound. Each creature in a 30-foot cone takes 4d6 sonic damage (DC 21 basic Fortitude save). Any creature that fails is [[Deafened]] for 1 round, or 1 hour on a critical failure.

```
