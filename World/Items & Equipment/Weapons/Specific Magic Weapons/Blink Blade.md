# Blink Blade

**Item 12**

> The blade of this *+2 [[Striking]] [[Dagger]]* is etched with whirling portals, and a single blue sapphire adorns its hilt. It feels lightweight and is always slightly warm to the touch.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬺{.Pathfinder }* Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You cast *[[Dimension Door]]*. The space you leave and the one you appear in are filled with puffs of smoke that make anyone within [[Concealed]] until they leave the smoke or until the end of your next turn, at which point the smoke dissipates. When used in strong winds, the smoke disperses immediately.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬲{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Trigger**: Your melee attack roll with the *blink blade* is a critical success;
**Effect**: You and your target teleport to a space within 10 feet. The target arrives in a safe, open space of your choosing adjacent to your arrival space. This teleportation also creates puffs of smoke, as noted with the activation above.

```
