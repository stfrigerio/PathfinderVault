# Anchor Spear

**Item 13**

> The tip of this *+2 greater striking [[Spear]]* is large and wickedly barbed, and the haft is inlaid with fine silver lines that run the length of the weapon. Wielded by specially trained [[Xulgath]] cavalry, *anchor spears* are used to prevent the escape of gogiteths or other monsters capable of climbing or burrowing.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Effect**: The *anchor spear* extends into a *+2 greater striking [[Longspear]]* or back to its original form as a *+2 greater striking spear*.

```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬲{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per 10 minutes;
**Trigger**: You damage a creature using the *anchor spear*;
**Effect**: The spear embeds itself into the creature, and the spear's haft splits along the silver lines to become a series of hooks attached to a thin but strong cable. As long as the *anchor spear* remains embedded in the creature, any time the creature burrows or climbs, it treats normal terrain as difficult terrain and difficult terrain as greater difficult terrain. The creature can spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 32 [[Athletics]] check to remove the spearhead.
