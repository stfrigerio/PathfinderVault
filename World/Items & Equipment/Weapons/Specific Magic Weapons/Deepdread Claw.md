# Deepdread Claw

**Item 14**

> One of a set of four identical spears collectively known as the Four Claws of the Deepdread, this weapon is fashioned from a single seamless piece of matte-black metal with a razored silver edge. In bright light, it functions as a *+1 [[Striking]] [[Spear]]* , but in darkness or dim light, it becomes a *+2 greater striking spear*. You can upgrade its fundamental runes as normal for a specific weapon, starting from a *+2 greater striking spear* , but its fundamental runes are always one type worse in bright light.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Effect**: You establish a telepathic link with someone else wielding a *deepdread claw* , enabling you to telepathically communicate with the creature while they possess the *deepdread claw* regardless of distance, so long as you remain on the same plane. You can end a telepathic link you create or that you are part of as an action, which has the [[Concentrate]] trait.

```
