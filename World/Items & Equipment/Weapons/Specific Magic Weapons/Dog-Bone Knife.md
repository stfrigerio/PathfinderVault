# Dog-Bone Knife

**Item 5**

> The blade of this *+1 [[Striking]] [[Dagger]]* is made from the thigh bone of a canine that died in the act of protecting its master. A [[Werecreature]] or other creature willingly under the effects of a non-permanent [[Polymorph]] effect damaged by a *dog-bone knife* must attempt a DC 19 Will save or immediately revert to its natural form—this has no effect on a creature unwillingly polymorphed. On a successful save, the creature is temporarily immune to this effect for 1 minute. [[Kushtakas]] and other creatures vulnerable to canines take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against this effect, and this weapon overcomes any resistance such creatures have to physical attacks.
