**Item 13**

> This *+2 [[Greater Striking]] [[Flintlock Pistol]]* bears strange, jagged markings of erratic design and has an oddly squishy grip. It can be activated to produce a variety of unusual effects.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬º{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact; 
**Effect**: Choose a creature within 60 feet and roll a percentile die on the table below to determine the pistol's effect. If an entry lists a spell, the pistol Casts that Spell at the indicated level (or at its lowest level, if no level is listed). You make any decisions for a spell cast by the pistol unless otherwise indicated, except that it must only target the creature you chose, or the creature you chose must be the center of the spell's area, if it has an area but no targets. The only exception to the limitation on targeting is if the effect specifically states it targets you. If the spell's range is less than 60 feet, increase the range to 60 feet.Any spell DC required is DC 29, and any spell attack roll required is +21. If the pistol casts a spell on you, you don't get a saving throw or any other defense against it. Once activated, the pistol can't be activated again for 1d4 hours.Pistol of Wonder
