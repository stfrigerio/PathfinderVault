# Skeletal Claw

**Item 9**

> This *+1 [[Striking]] [[Tekko-Kagi]]* resembles a clawed skeletal hand that fits over your own. Embedded in the back of the bony hand is an onyx gemstone held in place by fine silver chains. When the claws tear into a living creature, the gem pulses with negative energy. The *skeletal claw* deals an additional 1d4 [[Persistent Negative Damage]] to living creatures (1d10 persistent negative damage on a critical hit).

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â­“{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Trigger**: You cast a spell to summon an [[Undead]] creature that has a skeletal structure, such as with *[[Animate Dead]]* ;
**Effect**: The triggering undead creature has 10 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 minute. As long as any of these temporary Hit Points remain, the *skeletal claw* doesn't deal additional negative damage.
