# Gloaming Arc

**Item 11**

> This black *+2 [[Striking]] [[Scimitar]]* reflects light only along its edge, like a thin crescent moon. It grants a +1 item bonus to [[Stealth]] while you're holding it, increasing to a +2 item bonus if it has a *[[+3 Weapon Potency Rune]]*.

**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: Attempt a melee Strike with the *gloaming arc*. On a hit, you slice away the target's shadow from its body and it must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save.
