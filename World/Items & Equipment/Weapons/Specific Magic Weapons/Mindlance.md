# Mindlance

**Item 8**

> This *+1 [[Striking]] [[Arquebus]]* is used by caravan guards to nonlethally—though powerfully—deter large game and bandits. When fired, the spark gun deals mental damage and adds the [[Nonlethal]] trait to the attack. Each *mindlance* also includes a [[Reinforced Stock]] that benefits from any [[Fundamental Runes]] on the firearm. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with a *mindlance* , the target becomes [[Frightened 2]] unless it succeeds at a DC 24 Will save.
