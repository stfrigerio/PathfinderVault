# Crimson Brand

**Item 9**

> These ominous swords are decorated with crimson lacquer and serve as perfect conduits for the Crimson Oathâ€™s power. The first was granted to Clarethe Iomedar by a mysterious patron who many Reclaimers believe to be an emissary of [[Ragathiel]]. A *crimson brand* is a *+1 striking [[Wounding]] [[Bastard Sword]]*. When the wielder uses the crimson brand to cast *[[Invoke The Crimson Oath]]*, they can generate a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone instead of the normal 20-foot cone. Whenever the wielder would inflict [[Persistent Bleed Damage]] on an undead creature with the *crimson brand* , they can instead wreathe the creature in ruby energy, inflicting the same amount of persistent positive damage instead of persistent bleed damage.
