# Songbird's Brush

**Item 15**

> The blade of this *+2 [[Greater Striking]] [[Holy]] [[Glaive]]* shimmers with a prismatic sheen, as if faintly reflecting a rainbow. A *songbird's brush* sheds [[Bright Light]] in a 20-foot radius (and [[Dim Light]] for the next 40 feet). When wielded in combat, the sound of the blade cutting through the air creates a soft, musical trill as if produced by a songbird. Sacred to the faithful of [[Shelyn]], a *songbird's brush* is so named for the fighting style developed by worshippers of the Eternal Rose, which equates its sweeping swings to painting with a brush. A songbird's brush grants a +2 item bonus to [[Performance]] checks made to dance or sing as long as the glaive is held in two hands.
