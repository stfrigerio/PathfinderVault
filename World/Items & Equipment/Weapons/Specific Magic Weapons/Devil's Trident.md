# Devil's Trident

**Item 9**

> This *+1 [[Striking]] [[Returning]] [[Trident]]* is made of an ancient black metal that glistens unnaturally and is cold to the touch. The prongs of this trident drip with metallic lake water. Strikes with the *Devil's Trident* trigger the weaknesses of any creature with a weakness to water.
