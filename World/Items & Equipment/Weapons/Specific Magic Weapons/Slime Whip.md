# Slime Whip

**Item 7**

> This thick, greasy *+1 [[Striking]] [[Shifting]] [[Whip]]* is made from a slimy pseudopod. You don't take the usual –2 circumstance penalty to your attack rolls when using the slime whip to make a lethal attack. The whip's form can be changed just like any weapon with the *shifting* rune, but it reverts to its original form as soon as it isn't wielded. When in its whip form, you can use the following action.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*⬻{.Pathfinder }* command, Interact; 
**Frequency**: once per hour;
**Effect**: For 1 round, the slime whip deals acid damage rather than slashing damage. If the attack deals [[Persistent Damage]], the persistent damage is also acid damage instead of its usual type.

```
