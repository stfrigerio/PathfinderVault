# Orichalcum Weapon

**Item 18+**

> Orichalcum weapons can have four magic property runes instead of three. Due to orichalcum’s temporal properties, etching the [[ *Speed* ]] weapon property rune onto an orichalcum weapon costs half the normal Price (though transferring the rune to a weapon made of another material requires you to first pay the remaining Price and then pay the cost to transfer).

### Base Material

[[Orichalcum]]

## Orichalcum Weapon (High-Grade)

**Item 18**

**Price**22,500 gp (+ 2,250 gp per Bulk)
**Craft Requirements**at least 11,250 gp of orichalcum + 1,125 gp per Bulk
