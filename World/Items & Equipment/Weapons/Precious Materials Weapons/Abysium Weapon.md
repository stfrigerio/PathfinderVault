# Abysium Weapon

**Item 12+**

> Abysium weapons are safe to carry, as the toxic metal is contained within an outer shell. However, the inherent toxicity in these blue-green weapons can irradiate open wounds and poison foes. Abysium weapons have one fewer property rune slot, but they deal 1d4 poison damage on a successful Strike, and on a critical hit, the target is [[Sickened 1]] , or sickened 2 with high-grade abysium.
