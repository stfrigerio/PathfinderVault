# Peachwood Weapon

**Item 12+**

> Peachwood weapons have a particularly auburn tinge to them when under direct sunlight. Peachwood is treated as [[Darkwood]] for any [[Undead]] creatures' resistances or weaknesses related to darkwood (allowing a peachwood weapon to bypass a [[Jiang-Shi'S]] resistance, for example). In addition, peachwood weapons bypass a small portion of the resistances of any undead creature. Strikes with a peachwood weapon treat an undead's resistances against physical damage as 2 lower for standard-grade peachwood, and 4 lower for high-grade.
