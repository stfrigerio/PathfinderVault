# Butchering Axe

> Invented by Belkzen's zealous Steel-Eaters, the butchering axe has an oversized head and a long, thick haft counterbalanced with steel or stone. The weapon's sweeping strokes inflict immense damage, particularly against groups of foes, and can push dangerous opponents away to a safe distance. All of these qualities are particularly useful against the lumbering zombie hordes of the Whispering Tyrant. Correspondingly, butchering axes are often wielded by orc and half-orc Crimson Reclaimers of Lastwall.

## Traits

**Orc:** A creature with this trait is a member of the [[Orc]] ancestry. These green-skinned people tend to have [[Darkvision]]. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by orcs. An item with this trait is created and used by orcs.

**Shove:** You can use this weapon to [[Rules/Traits/Weapon/Shove]] with the [[Athletics]] skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's [[Reach]] (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

**Sweep:** This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.

**Uncommon:** Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [[Recall Knowledge]] checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Critical Specialization Effects

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
**Axe**: Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including extra dice for its *potency* rune, if any). This amount isn't doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.
