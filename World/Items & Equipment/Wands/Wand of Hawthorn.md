# Wand of Hawthorn

**Item 6+**

> Carved from a hawthorn branch, this wand has a smooth handle, but the shaft remains covered in bark and long thorns. Polished red stones, arranged like a cluster of berries, decorate the pommel.
**Activate**: Cast a Spell;
**Frequency**: once per day, plus overcharge;
**Effect**: You cast *[[Barkskin]]* of the indicated level, and the target sprouts long thorns like those of a hawthorn tree. While *barkskin* lasts, any creature that hits the target with an [[Unarmed]] Strike or otherwise touches it takes piercing damage from the thorns, with the amount determined by the wand's type. A creature that has [[Engulfed]] or [[Swallowed]] the target takes this damage as well at the start of each of the target's turns.
**Craft Requirements**: Supply a casting of *barkskin* of the appropriate level.
