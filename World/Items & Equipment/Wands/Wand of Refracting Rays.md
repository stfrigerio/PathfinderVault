**Effect**: You cast *[[Chromatic Ray]]* of the indicated level. After you cast the spell, if you hit the target, the light refracts to another creature within 30 feet of the first target. Roll your spell attack roll and to determine the ray's color separately for each target. The ray continues to refract each time it hits.
