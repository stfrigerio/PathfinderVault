# Wand of Crushing Leaps

**Item 4**

> This supple, light wooden wand drifts to the ground like a feather or leaf when dropped, landing unharmed. A thin coil of metal wraps around the wand's handle.
**Activate**: Cast a Spell;
**Frequency**: once per day, plus overcharge;
**Effect**: You cast *[[Jump]]*, but can jump up to 60 feet. When you land you shatter the ground, making each creature in a 5-foot emanation [[Flat-Footed]] until the start of its next turn. In addition, the space you land in and all squares in the emanation become difficult terrain for 1 minute.
**Craft Requirements**: Supply a casting of 1st-level *jump*.
