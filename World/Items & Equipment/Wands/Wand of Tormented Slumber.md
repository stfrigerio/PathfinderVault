# Wand of Tormented Slumber

**Item 10**

> The carved talon of an unidentifiable beast comprises this wand. Blood-stained cloth wraps the thicker part of the talon, which acts as a handle.
**Activate**: Cast a Spell;
**Frequency**: once per day, plus overcharge;
**Effect**: You cast 4th-level *[[Sleep]]*, but the slumbering creatures have terrifying nightmares. A creature knocked [[Unconscious]] by this spell takes 1d6 [[Persistent Mental Damage]]. This damage wakes the creature from unconsciousness only if it deals 4 or more damage on a single roll. If the creature awakens from its unconsciousness due to damage (whether it was the persistent mental damage or not), it's [[Frightened 1]]. If it awakens from damage on its own turn, the creature doesn't reduce its frightened condition automatically on that turn.
**Craft Requirements**: Supply a casting of 4th-level *sleep*.
