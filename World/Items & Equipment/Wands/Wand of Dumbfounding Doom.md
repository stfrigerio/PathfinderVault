# Wand of Dumbfounding Doom

**Item 8+**

> Carvings of skulls, monsters, and all manner of violence decorate this wand of blackened bone, but it makes absurd sounds when Activated, such as a honking horn, a manic giggle, or a daydreamy sigh.
**Activate**: Cast a Spell;
**Frequency**: once per day, plus overcharge;
**Effect**: You cast *[[Impending Doom]]* of the indicated level, showing the target a potential death that's gruesome and absurd. If the target becomes [[Frightened]] by the spell, it also becomes [[Stupefied]] with a value 1 higher than the frightened value. This lasts for the duration of the spell.
**Craft Requirements**: Supply a casting of *impending doom* of the appropriate level.
