title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact ([[Emotion]] [[Illusion]] [[Light]] [[Mental]] [[Visual]]) 
**Requirements**: The last action you took this turn was to Cast a Spell from the wand;
**Effect**: You make yourself the center of attention. An illusory spotlight shines [[Bright Light]] upon your space as you pull inane objects from the wand's tip, such as confetti, silk flowers, streamers, or a long string of colorful kerchiefs knotted end to end. Each enemy within 30 feet must attempt a Will save against your spell DC, receiving a +4 circumstance bonus to the save if you or any of your allies recently threatened it or used [[Hostile Actions]] against it. On a failure, the creature becomes [[Fascinated]] with you until the end of your next turn. The fascination ends if the target is subject to a hostile act, or if another creature succeeds at a [[Diplomacy]] or [[Intimidation]] check against it.The spotlight follows you wherever you move. You can't be [[Concealed]] while in the spotlight. The effect ends if you become [[Invisible]], attempt a [[Stealth]] check, or Dismiss the activation.You can Sustain this Activation for up to 1 minute. Since you need to keep performing tricks, Sustain an Activation has the [[Manipulate]] trait. Sustaining extends the spotlight, and keeps fascinated creatures fascinated, but doesn't cause creatures not already fascinated to become fascinated.
