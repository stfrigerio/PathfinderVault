# Wand of Traitorous Thoughts

**Item 12**

> When you hold this sleek, shiny gray wand, you hear a faint chorus of overlapping whispers.
**Activate**: Cast a Spell;
**Frequency**: once per day, plus overcharge;
**Effect**: You cast *[[Mind Probe]]*. The first time the target rolls a success at a [[Deception]] check to mislead your probe, it gets a result one step worse than it rolled. This means you learn the answer if the target's Deception check would have succeeded, and you learn nothing rather than believing a falsehood if the check would have been a critical success.
**Craft Requirements**: Supply a casting of *mind probe*.
