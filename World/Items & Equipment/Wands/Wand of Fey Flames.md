# Wand of Fey Flames

**Item 7**

> This red maple wand carved into a tongue of flame feels warm in your hand.
**Activate**: Cast a Spell;
**Frequency**: once per day, plus overcharge;
**Effect**: You cast *[[Faerie Fire]]*. For the duration of the spell, you can use the limning flames as a source for your magic. Creatures affected by your *faerie fire* must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or take a â€“2 status penalty to their Will saves against [[Magic/Enchantment]] and [[Illusions]] spells as long as they are affected by *faerie fire*. You can cast an enchantment or illusion spell on such a creature up to a distance twice the spell's normal range. If the spell has a range of touch, or doesn't have a range, it is unaffected by the increase in range from the *faerie fire*.
**Craft Requirements**: Supply a casting of *faerie fire*.
