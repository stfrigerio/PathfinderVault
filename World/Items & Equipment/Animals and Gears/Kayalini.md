# Kayalini

**Item 0**

> Originally brought to Absalom by [[Kayals]] fleeing the [[Shadow Plane]], kayalinis are shy creatures made from shadow. They resemble small [[Monkeys]] with reptilian features like claws, short horns, and long, shadowy tongues. When in a new home, they tend to hide under beds or in closets. Around people they trust, they'll sit quietly on a lap for hours.
