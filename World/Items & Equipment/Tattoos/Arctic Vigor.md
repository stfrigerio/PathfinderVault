## Arctic Vigor (Greater)

**Item 15**

**Price**: 6,000 gpThe damage of your polar wind increases to 12d6, the range increases to 60 feet, and you can choose to increase the radius to 15 or 20 feet.

You ignore the uneven ground and difficult terrain caused by ice and the difficult terrain caused by snow (reducing greater difficult terrain from ice or snow to normal difficult terrain).
