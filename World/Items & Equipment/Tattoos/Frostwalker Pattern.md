# Frostwalker Pattern

**Item 2**

> Northern peoples design magical tattoos to protect against wintry weather, typically in geometric patterns with a combination of straight lines and whorls. This tattoo negates any damage you take from [[Severe Environmental Cold]] and reduces damage you take from extreme cold to equal that of severe cold.
