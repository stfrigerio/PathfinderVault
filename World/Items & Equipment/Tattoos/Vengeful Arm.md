# Vengeful Arm

**Item 4**

> [[Abraxas]] teaches that an eye for an eye is the basis of law. This tattoo of a coiled viper provides a +1 item bonus to [[Society]] checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* envision; 
**Effect**: Abraxas transforms the tattoo into a weapon of your vengeance. The *vengeful arm* crawls into your hand and becomes a [[Retribution Axe]]. You can use this activation again while holding the axe to revert the vengeful arm to a tattoo. Like other *retribution axes* , you can etch fundamental runes into the *vengeful arm's*  *retribution axe* to increase its potency or to add *[[Striking]]*.

```
