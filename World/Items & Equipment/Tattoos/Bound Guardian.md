# Bound Guardian

**Item 9**

> A *bound guardian* is a [[Tattoo Guardian]] bonded to your skin, which you can temporarily animate to protect you. If your soul leaves your body, your tattoo guardian might be destroyed.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬½{.Pathfinder }* command, envision, Interact ([[Conjuration]]) 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: You animate your tattoo guardian, otherwise using the duration and other parameters of a 4th-level *[[Summon Construct]]* spell. You can have the guardian Fly Free as part of Activating your tattoo. If your tattoo guardian drops to 0 HP, the activation ends, and the inanimate tattoo returns to your skin.

```
