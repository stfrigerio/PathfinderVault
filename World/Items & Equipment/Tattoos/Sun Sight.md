# Sun Sight

**Item 10**

> Placed under the eyes like rays of light, this tattoo burns away illusions with the unmerciful brilliance of the sun. You gain a +2 bonus to Perception checks that involve sight. If you're [[Dazzled]], you receive a new save at the start of each of your turns to end your dazzled condition.
