# Reflexive Tattoo

**Item 7**

> This subtle pattern of complex dots, sunbursts, and lines is difficult to make out, as it's a near match for the wearer's skin tone. Serving as a barrier facing inward, this tattoo prevents ostentatious expressions of spells that are internal to you, making them easier to hide.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬»{.Pathfinder }* Interact ([[Concentrate]] [[Manipulate]] [[Metamagic]]) 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Effect**: If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell of 2nd level or lower that affects or targets only you, you can hide that you're casting it. This has the same effect as the [[Conceal Spell]] feat.

```
