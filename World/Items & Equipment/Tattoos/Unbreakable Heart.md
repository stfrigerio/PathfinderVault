# Unbreakable Heart

**Item 3**

> The name of your beloved adorns this stylized image of a heart. An *unbreakable heart* tattoo can be received only at the end of a successful *[[Heartbond]]* ritual, serving as your token. The other participant can have a token other than a tattoo if they wish. If you have more than one heartbond, each *unbreakable heart* you have serves as a token for only one of them.The love exuding from you grants you a +1 item bonus to [[Diplomacy]] checks. When you use *heartbond's* activity to learn your beloved's present state, you can also grant them a small gift, choosing from the following options each time. Make your choice after learning their state.
