# One Hundred Victories

**Item 3**

> One hundred cuts, healed into diamond-shaped scars, represent the ability to withstand the attacks of your enemies. [[Orc]] warriors covet these scar patterns and cluster them around what they consider to be their strongest assetsâ€”a pattern around the heart signifies a warrior with great endurance, while one along the arms indicates great upper body strength.You gain a +1 item bonus to [[Intimidation]] checks. If you have [[Ferocity]] (such as from the [[Orc Ferocity]] feat or a similar ability), the first time each day you use it, instead of remaining at 1 Hit Point, your Hit Points are set to an amount equal to your ancestry Hit Points, even if this amount is more than you had before using Ferocity.
