# Boozy Bottle

**Item 5**

> This tattoo depicts a container of alcohol, traditionally a small, uncorked brown bottle. You gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against [[Poison]].

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**
*â¬²{.Pathfinder }* command; 
**Frequency**: once per day;
**Trigger**: You fail (but don't critically fail) an initial saving throw against a poison, or you gain [[Persistent Poison Damage]] ;
**Effect**: You pick your poison. Calling out the name of a drink as though ordering at a bar, you negate the triggering poison. Instead, you gain the [[Alcohol]] affliction at stage 2. The DC of this magical alcohol is the DC of the triggering poison save or DC 20 for persistent poison damage.
