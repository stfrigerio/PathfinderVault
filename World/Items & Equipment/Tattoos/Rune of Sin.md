# Rune of Sin

**Item 12**

> This jagged glyph, one of the [[Thassilonian Runes Of Sin]], reacts to magic of a particular school (there's no rune for [[Magic/Divination]], as it was considered lesser within sin magic). When you Cast a Spell of the school matching the sin, you gain resistance 5 to damage from spells until the start of your next turn. This resistance is increased to 7 against spells of the matching school. This tattoo has the school trait matching the rune: [[Abjuration]] for envy, [[Necromancy]] for gluttony, [[Transmutation]] for greed, [[Magic/Enchantment]] for lust, [[Illusion]] for pride, [[Magic/Conjuration]] for sloth, and [[Magic/Evocation]] for wrath.
