# Eye Slash

**Item 1+**

> Small scars or marks around your eye improve your distant vision. These scars are especially common among [[Orc]] scouts, who favor scars shaped like eagle talons. You can see four times farther than normal. If you have [[Darkvision]], you can see blood in color. Higher-level versions of an *eye slash* are larger and more elaborate scars or marks, radiating out around the eye.
