# Fungal Armor

**Item 15**

> This *+2 [[Greater Resilient]]  [[Studded Leather]]* is made of hardened fungus. Every day the armor grows dozens of unusual mushrooms that can be used for cooking, infused reagents, or common spell material components.

> [!embed-ability]- **Activate**
> *⬲{ .Pathfinder }* or *⬻{ .Pathfinder }* envision;
> **Frequency**: once per day;
> **Trigger**: You are hit by a melee, ranged, or spell attack;
> **Effect**: The attack misses you, dealing no damage as you transform into a cloud of spores. You gain the benefits of a [[Gaseous Form]] spell for 1 minute. For the duration, a cloud of deadly spores surrounds you. Each breathing creature that begins its turn within 10 feet of you takes 6d8 poison damage (DC 35 basic Fortitude save). You can Dismiss the cloud form.


**Craft Requirements**: Supply a casting of [[ *Cloudkill* ]] and [[ *Gaseous Form* ]] .
