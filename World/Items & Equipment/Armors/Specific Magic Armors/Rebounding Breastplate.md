# Rebounding Breastplate

**Item 20**

> This *+3 [[Greater Resilient]]  [[Greater Fortification]]  [[Nethys/Equipment/Armors/Breastplate]] * absorbs impacts for later release. While wearing the armor, you gain resistance 5 to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and resistance 10 to [[Force]] damage. Keep track of how much damage the armor prevents from enemy attacks, as the armor absorbs that damage. After 1 minute, the absorbed damage disperses harmlessly and resets to 0. Only damage caused by foes or hazards powers the armor, not damage you take from yourself, allies, or the environment.

> [!embed-ability]- **Activate**
> *â¬»{ .Pathfinder }* Interact;
> **Requirements**: Your armor has absorbed at least 30 damage;
> **Effect**: The absorbed energy explodes from your armor in a pulse of force. Creatures in a 30-foot emanation take 10d6 force damage with a DC 43 [[Basic]] Fortitude save. On a failure, they're [[Pushed]] 10 feet away from you, and on a critical failure, they're pushed 20 feet away from you and fall [[Prone]] . The armor's absorbed damage resets to 0.
