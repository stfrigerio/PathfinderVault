# Blade Byrnie

**Item 7+**

> Instead of chain links, this +1 [[Chain Shirt]] is assembled from metal “leaves” that each resemble a small blade.

> [!embed-ability]- **Activate**
>  *⬻{ .Pathfinder }* interact; 
> **Effect**: You pull a link from the armor, which transforms into a +1 [[Striking]] [[Dagger]]. The dagger disappears and reappears as a link in the armor after you Strike with it, or at the end of this turn if you don't make a Strike. You can Activate the blade byrnie in place of an Interact action to draw a weapon for abilities such as the [[Quick Drawfeat]].

Upgrading the runes on the blade byrnie makes the daggers pulled from it more powerful. The daggers have a+2 [[Weapon potency]] rune if the armor has a +2 [[Armor potency]] rune, or a+3 weapon potency rune if the armor has a+3 armor potency rune
