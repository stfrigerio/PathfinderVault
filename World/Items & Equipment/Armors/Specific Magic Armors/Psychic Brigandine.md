# Psychic Brigandine

**Item 13**

> Transparent crystals as hard as steel take the place of metal plates on this suit of *+2 [[Greater Invisibility]]  [[Splint Mail]] * . Also known as a coat of a thousand thoughts in Vudra and Jalmeray, where it was first developed by psychic warriors, it makes your mind an indomitable fortress. You gain resistance 5 to [[Mental]] damage.
> 
> Whenever you use the armor to become [[Invisible]] , you also become psychically invisible. Each time you would be affected by an effect with the mental trait while you are invisible, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, it doesn't affect you.
