# Glorious Plate

**Item 14**

> This elegant [[Nethys/Equipment/Armors/Full Plate]] is embossed with heraldic imagery and never tarnishes or loses its shine. *Glorious plate* is *+2 resilient full plate* . In battle, *glorious plate* sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius, which enemies see as a blinding halo that obscures creatures other than the wearer. When an enemy looks at the wearer, it must attempt a DC 33 Will saving throw. The enemy is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Success**: The enemy is unaffected.
**Failure**: For 1 minute, the wearer’s allies within the glorious plate’s 10-foot radius of light are [[Concealed]] to the enemy. Allies are concealed only while they remain within the light; if allies enter the light later, they are concealed as well.
**Critical Failure**: As failure, except the wearer’s allies are [[Hidden]] to the enemy instead of concealed.
