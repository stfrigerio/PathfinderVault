# Jerkin of Liberation

**Item 17**

> This *+2 [[Greater Resilient]]  [[Studded Leather]]* is traditionally inscribed with a symbol of either [[Norgorber]] or [[Cayden Cailean]]. Its leather is light as silk, and its buttons and studs are gleaming crystal. While you wear it, you get a +15-foot item bonus to your Speed, and effects that attempt to impose penalties on your Speed must first [[Counteract]] the *jerkin of liberation* or they have no effect on you.
> 
> In addition, you are hard to incapacitate. You use the jerkin's item level or your own level, whichever is higher, to determine effects of the [[Incapacitation]] trait.
