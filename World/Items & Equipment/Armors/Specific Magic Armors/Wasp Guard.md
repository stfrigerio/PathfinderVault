# Wasp Guard

**Item 8**

>  [[Druids]] and [[Calistria]]'s' faithful alike value this vindictive armor for its ability to turn away pests and exact revenge on foes in a manner that can easily turn coordinated enemies into a chaotic mass. *Wasp guard* is *+1 [[Studded Leather]] * studded with the carapaces of [[Wasps]] , subtly diverting swarms away and granting a +1 status bonus to Reflex saving throws against Swarming Bites, Swarming Stings, and similar abilities from [[Swarms]] .


> [!embed-ability]- **Activate**
> *â¬²{ .Pathfinder }* envision;
> **Frequency**: once per day;
> **Trigger**: An enemy within 30 feet Strikes you with an attack;
> **Effect**: You animate the exoskeletons of the *wasp guard* armor into a spectral swarm of wasps that seeks revenge for the slight. The swarm flies to the triggering enemy's space and swarms about them, dealing 1d8 [[Persistent Poison Damage]] . If the affected enemy has any allies within 30 feet, the enemy can spend a single action, which has the [[Manipulate]] trait, to shoo the swarm away. This ends the persistent damage on that enemy automatically, but the swarm instead moves to affect the enemy's ally.

**Craft Requirements**: The initial raw materials must include 1 Bulk of wasp exoskeletons.
