# Harmonic Hauberk

**Item 13**

> Rose gold and copper rings in this *+2 [[Resilient]]  [[Chain Shirt]]* form a vague bird shape. The jingling links tinkle musically, almost like birdsong. While you wear the armor, effects with the [[Auditory]] trait must first [[Counteract]] the *harmonic hauberk* or they have no effect on you.
> 
> The *harmonic hauberk* attempts to counteract [[Silence]] spells cast on you and 4th-level or higher heightened *silence* spells the first time the armor enters their area (counteract level 4, counteract modifier +20). After failing to counteract a *silence* spell, the armor can't attempt to counteract the same spell again, even if you leave and enter the spell's area multiple times.

> [!embed-ability]- **Activate**
> *â¬»{ .Pathfinder }* interact;
> **Activate**: command;
> **Frequency**: once per day;
> **Requirements**: You have a pool of Focus Points and at least one [[Composition]] spell;
> **Effect**: You gain 1 Focus Point and immediately use the Focus Point to cast [[Lingering Composition]] , using your [[Performance]] check to determine the effects of the spell, followed by the [[Inspire Defense]] composition cantrip. You can use this activation to cast those spells even if you don't have the [[Lingering Composition]] or [[Inspire Defense]] feats.
