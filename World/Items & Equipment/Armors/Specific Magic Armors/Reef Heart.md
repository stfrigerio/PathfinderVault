# Reef Heart

**Item 12+**

> This *+2 [[Resilient]]  [[Coral Armor]] * , often favored by allies of [[Merfolk]] and aquatic [[Elves]] , is made of living coral carefully harvested from the ocean depths. Legends speak of a variety of similar coral armors with distinct powers, but surface-dwellers know of *reef heart* as a magic armor that makes it easier for them to travel under the sea. *Reef heart* enables you to breathe underwater and gives you a swim Speed equal to half your land Speed.


> [!embed-ability]- **Activate**
> *â¬½{ .Pathfinder }* command, envision, Interact;
> **Frequency**: once per day;
> **Effect**: You cast [[ *Coral Eruption* ]] . If you conjure the coral underwater, it ceases dealing damage after 1 minute, but its duration is unlimited. If the magical coral remains in place for 1 year, it becomes non-magical coral from which a reef might grow.
