# Leopard's Armor

**Item 9**

> Made of cobalt-colored steel rings that flow down the entire length of the garment, this *+1 [[Resilient]]  [[Chain Mail]]* includes an armored face covering. The armor is said to be based on the same armor once worn by Azure Leopard, one of Old-Mage Jatembe's magic warriors.

> [!embed-ability]- **Activate**
> *⬺{ .Pathfinder }* command, envision;
> **Frequency**: once per day;
> **Effect**: You call upon the ferocity and grace of the leopard. The armor's rings flatten out to become a solid piece of flexible armor. You gain a +2 item bonus to [[Stealth]] checks and [[Intimidation]] checks to [[Demoralize]] , but take a –2 penalty to [[Diplomacy]] and [[Society]] checks. This lasts for 1 hour, but you can Activate the armor again to revert it back to its original form.
