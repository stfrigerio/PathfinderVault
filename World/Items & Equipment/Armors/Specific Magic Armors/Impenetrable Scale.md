# Impenetrable Scale

**Item 17**

> Made of overlapping, lustrous black scales of standard-grade adamantine, this *+2 [[Greater Resilient]] [[Fortification]]  [[Adamantine]]  [[Scale Mail]]* seems to momentarily thicken at the point of impact when hit. Whenever the armor’s *fortification* rune successfully turns a significant foe’s critical hit into a normal hit, one of the scales on the armor turns violet. You gain resistance to physical damage equal to the number of violet scales, to a maximum of 8.At dawn each day, all the violet scales return to normal.

**Craft Requirements**: The initial raw materials must include 1,600 gp of adamantine.
