# Prismatic Plate

**Item 17**

> With its standard-grade mithral polished to a mirrorlike sheen, this *+2 [[Resilient]]  [[Glamered]]  [[Mithral]]  [[Nethys/Equipment/Armors/Breastplate]] * features the religious symbols of the goddesses of [[The Prismatic Ray]] pantheon— [[Desna]] , [[Sarenrae]] , and [[Shelyn]] —surrounded by a rainbow-colored set of gems.



> [!embed-ability]- **Activate**
> *⬺{ .Pathfinder }* command, Interact;
> **Frequency**: once per day;
> **Effect**: You surround yourself in a coruscating field of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet light for 1 minute. Each color has a different effect, based on the effects of a 7th-level [[ *Chromatic Wall* ]] spell, and you apply the effects of each color once before it disappears from your field of light, which can happen in the following two ways.First, the field attempts a [[Counteract]] check (counteract level 7, counteract modifier +27) against any effect that would be blocked by a *chromatic wall* of any of the colors still surrounding you in your field of light. Succeed or fail, that color then disappears from your field of light.Second, any creature that touches you or damages you with an [[Unarmed]] attack or non- [[Reach]] melee weapon is affected by a random remaining color from your field. As normal, this doesn't affect creatures you choose to touch.A creature can also remove a color from your field of light by using a specific spell, as described in *chromatic wall* . The effect ends early if each color disappears from your field of light, or if you choose to Dismiss it.


**Craft Requirements**: The initial raw materials must include 1,600 gp of mithral.
