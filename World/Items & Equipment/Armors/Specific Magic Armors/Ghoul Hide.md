# Ghoul Hide

**Item 6**

> Stitched together from pieces of ghoul skin, this suit of *+1 [[Hide Armor]]* grants you a +1 item bonus to saving throws against disease and paralysis and makes you immune to the paralysis of ghouls. *Ghoul hide* with a *resilient rune* increases the resilient runeâ€™s item bonus to saving throws against disease and paralysis by 1 (maximum +4). 
> 
> *Ghoul hide* hisses with sibilant hatred at the touch of elves. When worn by a creature with the elf trait, the armor gains the noisy trait.
