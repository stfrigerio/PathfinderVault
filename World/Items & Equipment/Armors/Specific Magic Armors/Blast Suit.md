# Blast Suit

**Item 9**

> Crafted from heavy steel plating and riveted together with cunning precision, this suit of +1 [[Resilient]] [[Nethys/Equipment/Armors/Full Plate]] is specifically designed to protect against sudden explosions. This added layer of security comes at the cost of movement, however.

> [!embed-ability]- **Activate**
>  *⬲{ .Pathfinder }* command; 
> **Trigger**: You're affected by an area effect that requires a Reflex save, or you would take splash damage from a scatter weapon;
> **Effect**: The _blast suit_ locks together into a rigid bulwark, protecting you from the blast but preventing you from moving from your position under any circumstances. You become [[Immobilized]], gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex save against area effects, and gain resistance 5 to all damage you would normally take from area effects and scatter splash damage (this doesn't damage the _blast suit_). These effects persist for as long as the suit remains in the locked position. You can Interact with the suit to unlock it.
