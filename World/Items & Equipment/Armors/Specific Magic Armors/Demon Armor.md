# Demon Armor

**Item 13**

> Crafted from black iron, this crude suit of +2 [[Resilient]] [[Nethys/Equipment/Armors/Full Plate]] is designed to make you look like a horned demon, with your face peering out of the screaming maw of the beast.
> 
> While wearing the armor, you can attack with the helmet’s horns. They are a martial melee weapon with the effects of a+2 weapon potency rune. They deal 2d8 piercing damage and have the deadly d12 trait. On a critical hit with the horns, the target must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save against the [[Abysall plague disease]]. The horns can’t be etched with any runes.
> 
> If you aren’t evil, you’re drained 2 and can’t recover from this condition while wearingdemon armor.

> [!embed-ability]- **Activate**
> *⬺{ .Pathfinder }* command; 
> **Frequency**: once per day;
> **Effect**: You cast [[Dimension door]].


**Craft Requirements**: You are evil; supply one casting of dimension door.
