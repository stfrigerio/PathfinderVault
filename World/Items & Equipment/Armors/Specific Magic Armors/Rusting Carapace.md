# Rusting Carapace

**Item 8**

> This *+1 [[Leather Lamellar Armor]] * incorporates the plates of a [[Rust Monster'S]] hide, woven together with the creature's own antennae and sinew into a functional set of armor. While wearing the *rusting carapace* , you gain a +2 item bonus to your Reflex save to prevent an object you're holding from being affected by rust; this also increases your Reflex DC to avoid being [[Disarmed]] by a rust monster's Antenna Disarm ability.


> [!embed-ability]- **Activate**
> *â¬º{ .Pathfinder }* Interact;
> **Frequency**: once per day;
> **Effect**: Feathery antennae extend from between the segments of the rusting hide and brush against a nearby metal creature, non-magical metal hazard, or non-magical metal item of up to 1 Bulk, with the effects of [[Rusting Grasp]] . The DC is 24.

**Craft Requirements**: The initial raw materials must include the hide of a [[Rust Monster]] .
