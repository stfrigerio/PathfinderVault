# Invisible Chain Shirt

**Item 13**

> This *+2 [[Resilient]]  [[Invisibility]]  [[Chain Shirt]]* is itself invisible. Other creatures can't see it at all, allowing you to wear it surreptitiously. Additionally, the armor's invisible composition is quieter and more comfortable than a normal chain shirt. It loses the [[Noisy]] trait and gains the [[Comfort]] trait.

> [!embed-ability]- **Activate**
> *â¬º{ .Pathfinder }* envision;
> **Frequency**: once per minute;
> **Effect**: You Stride and turn partially invisible, becoming [[Concealed]] until the end of your next turn or until you use a [[Hostile Action]] , whichever comes first. As normal, you can use the concealment from this activation to [[Hide]] .
