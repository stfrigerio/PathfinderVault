# Noxious Jerkin

**Item 13**

> This *+2 resilient [[Padded Armor]] * is woven from many strands of gut cord strung with dried organs and preserved [[Xulgath]] scent glands. When worn, it infuses your body with a ghastly and nauseating flavor.

> [!embed-ability]- **Activate**
> *â­“{ .Pathfinder }* envision;
> **Trigger**: You are grabbed or are hit by an unarmed attack;
> **Effect**: Your attacker must attempt a DC 28 Fortitude saving throw. Creatures with a stench aura, such as [[Otyughs]] and xulgaths, are immune to this effect.

**Success**: The creature is unaffected and is immune to the effects of the noxious jerkin for 1 minute.
**Failure**: The creature is [[Sickened 1.]] 
**Critical Failure**: The creature is sickened 1 and is [[Slowed 1]] for 1 round.
