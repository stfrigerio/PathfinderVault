# Energizing Lattice

**Item 13**

> This suit of +2 [[Resilient]] [[Fortification]] [[Lattice Armor]] has latticework of fine golden wire. After negating a critical hit with its fortification rune, the latticework glows for 1 minute, shedding [[Bright Light]] in a 20-foot radius (and [[Dim Light]] for the next 20 feet). You can Dismiss this light.

 > [!embed-ability]- **Activate**
> *⬺{ .Pathfinder }* envision ([[Force]]);
> **Requirements**: The _energizing lattice_ is glowing because it negated an enemy's critical hit;
> **Effect**: You release the lattice's energy and make a weapon or unarmed attack Strike that deals 6d6 additional force damage. If your Strike fails, but doesn't critically fail, the target still takes half the force damage. The latticework ceases glowing after the Strike.
