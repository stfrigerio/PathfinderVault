# Mantis Shell

**Item 1**

> Construction of mantis shell armor originates with the Red Mantis assassins. Authentic mantis shell can be found in some dark markets, but wearing such armor can attract deadly attention from the armor's originators. Mantis shell comes with the [[weapon harness]] adjustment, though these special vambraces are meant to hold [[sawtooth sabers]], and attaching anything else is an insult to the Red Mantis.

## Traits 

**[[Adjusted]] Weapon Harness**: The equipment comes with an adjustment described in its entry. This adjustment is built into the equipment permanently, meaning the equipment can't have another adjustment added, nor can it be swapped out for a different adjustment. If the adjustment alters the item's base statistics, such as adding the noisy trait, that's reflected in the equipment's table entry.
**[[Uncommon]]**: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Armor Specialization Effects 

Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.  
  
**Skeletal**: Armor made from the bone or exoskeleton of creatures as diverse as bears, insects, and coral, skeletal armor protects vital points from precision damage. You gain resistance to precision damage equal to 3 + the value of the armor's potency rune for medium armor, or 5 + the value of the armor's potency rune for heavy armor
