# Ceramic Plate

> Traditional armor from Senghor, ceramic plate alleviates the need for metallurgy and smithing, instead relying on ceramic firing, glazing, and strong cord work with a backing of leather and thick canvas. Ceramic plate that follows Senghor's style is colorful and artistic, and is built with the [[armor latches]] armor adjustment.
## Traits

**[[Adjusted]] Armor Latches**: The equipment comes with an adjustment described in its entry. This adjustment is built into the equipment permanently, meaning the equipment can't have another adjustment added, nor can it be swapped out for a different adjustment. If the adjustment alters the item's base statistics, such as adding the noisy trait, that's reflected in the equipment's table entry.
**[[Noisy]]**: This armor is loud and likely to alert others to your presence. The armor's check penalty applies to Stealth checks even if you meet the required Strength score.

## Armor Specialization Effects

Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.  
  
**Plate**: The sturdy plate provides no purchase for a cutting edge. You gain resistance to slashing damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor.
