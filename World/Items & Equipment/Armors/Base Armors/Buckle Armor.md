# Buckle Armor

Absalom style once led famous adventurers to wear clothing with an unusual number of buckles, pouches, and straps. This fashion birthed a trend that led to “buckle armor,” a colloquial name for chic armor with spacious tool storage. Buckle armor comes with the [[storage]] armor adjustment.
## Traits

**[[Adjusted]] Storage**: The equipment comes with an adjustment described in its entry. This adjustment is built into the equipment permanently, meaning the equipment can't have another adjustment added, nor can it be swapped out for a different adjustment. If the adjustment alters the item's base statistics, such as adding the noisy trait, that's reflected in the equipment's table entry.
**[[Noisy]]**: This armor is loud and likely to alert others to your presence. The armor's check penalty applies to Stealth checks even if you meet the required Strength score.

## Armor Specialization Effects

Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.  
  
**Leather**: The thick second skin of the armor disperses blunt force to reduce bludgeoning damage. You gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor.
