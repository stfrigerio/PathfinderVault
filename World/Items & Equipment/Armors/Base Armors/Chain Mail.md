# Chain Mail

> A suit of chain mail consists of several pieces of armor composed of small metal rings linked together in a protective mesh. It typically includes a chain shirt, leggings, a pair of arms, and a coif, collectively protecting most of the body.

## Traits

**[[Flexible]]**: The armor is flexible enough that it doesn't hinder most actions. You don't apply its check penalty to [[Acrobatics]] or [[Athletics]] checks.
**[[Noisy]]**: This armor is loud and likely to alert others to your presence. The armor's check penalty applies to [[Stealth]] checks even if you meet the required Strength score.

## Armor Specialization Effects

Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.  
  
**Chain**: The armor is so flexible it can bend with a critical hit and absorb some of the blow. Reduce the damage from critical hits by either 4 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 6 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor. This can’t reduce the damage to less than the damage rolled for the hit before doubling for a critical hit.
