# O-Yoroi

**Item 2**

> Larger plates coupled with lamellar pieces to make up a suit of heavy lamellar. The custom-fitted and often highly decorative suit covers most of the body. Rounding out the suit are a tiered helmet and fearsome mask, often depicting a fiendish or monstrous creature.

## Traits 

**[[Bulwark]]**: The armor covers you so completely that it provides benefits against some damaging effects. On Reflex saves to avoid a damaging effect, such as a *fireball*, you add a +3 modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier.
**[[Laminar]]**: The armor is made up of layered sections, so when it breaks, it isn't as much of a problem. The status penalty to AC if this armor is broken is –1 for broken medium armor, –2 for broken heavy armor, or no penalty for broken light armor.

## Armor Specialization Effects 

Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.  
  
**Composite**: The numerous overlapping pieces of this armor protect you from piercing attacks. You gain resistance to piercing damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor.
