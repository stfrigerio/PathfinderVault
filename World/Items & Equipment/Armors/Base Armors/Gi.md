# Gi

Also called martial arts suits or practice clothes, gi are outfits of tough cloth built for comfort and unrestricted movement—ideal for practicing martial arts. They have reinforced stitching resistant to strenuous use.

## Traits 

**[[Comfort]]**: The armor is so comfortable that you can rest normally while wearing it.

## Armor Specialization Effects 

Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.  
  
**Cloth**: *Nethys Note: there is no medium or heavy cloth armor, so there is no armor specialization effect for the cloth armor group.*
