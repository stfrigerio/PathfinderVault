# Fortress Plate

**Item 2**

[[Dwarves]] of Dongun Hold developed fortress plate, which is still popular in Alkenstar and Dongun Hold. A trained wearer can adjust the articulated armor's overlapping layers of plates and panels to provide protection from missiles.

## Traits 


**[[Bulwark]]**: The armor covers you so completely that it provides benefits against some damaging effects. On Reflex saves to avoid a damaging effect, such as a *fireball*, you add a +3 modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier.
Entrench Ranged:: You can position yourself in the armor or reposition its articulated pieces to better protect against some attacks. If you're trained in this armor, while wearing it you can spend a single action to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against a certain type of attack until the start of your next turn. The entrench trait lists the type of attack this bonus applies against, typically entrench melee or entrench ranged.
**[[Ponderous]]**: The armor has moving parts or other complications that lengthen the wearer's initial reaction time. While wearing the armor, you take a –1 penalty to initiative checks. If you don't meet the armor's required Strength score, this penalty increases to be equal to the armor's check penalty if it's worse.
## Armor Specialization Effects 

Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.  
  
**Plate**: The sturdy plate provides no purchase for a cutting edge. You gain resistance to slashing damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor.
