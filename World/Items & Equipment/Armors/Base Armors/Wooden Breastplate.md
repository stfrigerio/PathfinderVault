# Wooden Breastplate

A suit of carved and tempered wood, a wooden breastplate resembles a metal breastplate in shape and function. Such suits can be carved from large pieces of wood, but they most often come from wood coaxed magically from special trees, whether by [[druids]], [[elves]], [[fey]], or [[plant]] creatures such as [[arboreals]] or [[leshys]].  

## Armor Specialization Effects

Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.  
  
**Wood**: Wood armor is generally flexible and light, but it can splinter as it breaks, throwing off shards and fragments that damage foes who deal you critical blows. If a foe critically hits you with a melee unarmed attack or critically hits you with any melee attack while adjacent to you, it takes piercing damage equal to 3 + the armor's potency rune value for medium armor, or 5 + the armor's potency rune value for heavy armor.
