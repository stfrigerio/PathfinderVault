# Armored Coat

> A custom, lightweight mail is fitted within the lining of a coat or similar apparel, physically hiding the armor while maintaining the wearer's fashion. While not nearly as protective as heavier armors, the armored coat allows the wearer to blend in more aesthetically during civilian functions. Like other suits of armor, the armored coat is custom-fitted to an individual's body type, ensuring comfort without sacrificing its defensive capabilities.

## Traits

**[[Comfort]]**: The armor is so comfortable that you can rest normally while wearing it.
**[[Flexible]]**: The armor is flexible enough that it doesn't hinder most actions. You don't apply its check penalty to Acrobatics or Athletics checks.
**[[Uncommon]]**: Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

## Armor Specialization Effects

Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.  
  
**Leather**: The thick second skin of the armor disperses blunt force to reduce bludgeoning damage. You gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor.
