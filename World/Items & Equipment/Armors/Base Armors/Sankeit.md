#  Sankeit

> Sankeit is common armor among Varki in the northern Land of the Linnorm Kings, made of small wooden plates or longer slats, typically vertical, joined with sinew or cord and painted with decorations. Varki warriors traditionally wear sankeit with a fearsome wooden helm carved in the shape of a mighty creature.
## Traits 


**[[Laminar]]**: The armor is made up of layered sections, so when it breaks, it isn't as much of a problem. The status penalty to AC if this armor is broken is –1 for broken medium armor, –2 for broken heavy armor, or no penalty for broken light armor.

## Armor Specialization Effects 

Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.  
  
**Wood**: Wood armor is generally flexible and light, but it can splinter as it breaks, throwing off shards and fragments that damage foes who deal you critical blows. If a foe critically hits you with a melee unarmed attack or critically hits you with any melee attack while adjacent to you, it takes piercing damage equal to 3 + the armor's potency rune value for medium armor, or 5 + the armor's potency rune value for heavy armor.
