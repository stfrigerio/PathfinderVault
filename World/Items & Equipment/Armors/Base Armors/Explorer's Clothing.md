# Explorer's Clothing

> Adventurers who don’t wear armor travel in durable clothing. Though it’s not armor and uses your unarmored defense proficiency, it still has a Dex Cap and can grant an item bonus to AC if etched with [[potency runes]].

## Traits

**[[Comfort]]**: The armor is so comfortable that you can rest normally while wearing it.

## Armor Specialization Effects

Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.  
  
**Cloth**: *Nethys Note: there is no medium or heavy cloth armor, so there is no armor specialization effect for the cloth armor group.*

## Specific Magic Armor

[[Sarkorian God-Caller Garb]]
