> The ***champion's banner*** is a cloth flag or standard, such as the kinds displayed on lances or [[Polearm|polearms]]. It displays either a [[Lion|lion]] or the [[Heraldry|personal symbol]] of the person carrying it properly mounted. Bearers who challenge their foes find this item increases their skills during such challenges.
