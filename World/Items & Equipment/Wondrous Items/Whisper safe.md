> ***Whisper safes*** appear as jewelry boxes with a black finish and a mask emblem that reflects the world around it.


## Effects

> If someone opens the safe, speaks a fact into the opening, and then closes it, the safe attunes to this fact. This user can then learn about the fact, including:

> - How many people know the fact
> - Gender, vocation, and race of those people
> - Most common name of each of those people
> If any of the above details have been actively obscured by someone, the safe stays silent about them.


## Construction

> Some churches in [[Absalom]] offer this item to [[Adventurer|adventurers]] for 8,000 [[Gold piece|gold pieces]].
