> A **charm of aluum control** is used by the [[Pactmasters|pactmasters]] of [[Katapesh]] to control their [[Aluum|aluum]] constructs. Each charm is tuned to a particular aluum, allowing the charm's owner to command it. Other aluums may possibly be affected, but if one is, the charm switches its attunement to the new aluum. Unauthorized possession of a charm is a serious crime. Attempting to command an aluum to attack a Pactmaster, a government official, or city structure often causes the aluum to instead attack the charm's owner.
