> An ***elixir of shadewalking*** is usually kept in a small bone jar or flask. Imbibing it allows the user and up to 11 other individuals to temporarily enter the [[Plane of Shadow]] as if under the effects of a *[[Shadow walk|shadow walk]]* [[Spell|spell]]. These *elixirs* are sometimes carried by high-ranking [[Red Mantis|Red Mantis assassins]] in order to assist them in reaching a target for assassination.
