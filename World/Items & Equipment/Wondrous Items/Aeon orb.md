> The ***aeon orbs*** are powerful [[Magic item|magical]] crystals that emit a form of [[Radiation|radiation]] that supercharges plant growth in a 15-mile radius around them. The [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]] took them from the [[Darklands]] in the first decades after he raised the [[Isle of Kortos]] from the seafloor, and placed them into the [[Aeon Tower|Aeon Towers]] located on Kortos and the nearby [[Isle of Erran]]. They enhanced agriculture throughout the islands for millennia until Aroden's death at the end of the [[Age of Enthronement]]. Since then, their [[Divine magic|divine magic]] has begun to fade, leaving the aeon orbs and towers vulnerable.
