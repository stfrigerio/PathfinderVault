## *Cubes of Nex*

> The legends say that the first *cubes of force* were created by [[Nex person|archmage Nex]] himself during his wars with [[Geb (person)|Geb]]. It is believed that Nex created nine *cubes*, and kept the *[[Cubes of Nex|Cube of Nex]]* for himself, and gifted one to each of his eight most loyal [[Wizard|wizards]]. The eight *Cubes of Nex* are designed to thwart [[Spell|spells]] from one of the eight [[Schools of magic|schools of magic]], even when not activated and block its opposition school so as not to interfere with the spellcasting. The powers of the *Cube of Nex* were a closely guarded secret, but rumor has it that, with his *cube*, Nex could block incoming [[Magic|magic]] at will while still casting spells outward. The *Cube of Nex* vanished with Nex and has not been seen since. Of the remaining eight *cubes*, three have stayed in Nex. The *[[Cubes of Nex|evocation]]*, *[[Cubes of Nex|necromancy]]*, and *[[Cubes of Nex|transmutation]] cubes* reside in the [[Bandeshar]] in [[Quantium]].
