> A ***rimepelt*** is the pelt of a snow-white [[Winter wolf|winter wolf]] that gives resistance to cold when worn over the shoulders as a cloak. It also allows the wearer to assume the shape of a winter wolf. If used in such a manner and if the user is in a magical area that allows winter wolves to assume [[Human|human]] form, the wearer can as well. When used for a transformation, the effect lasts for a maximum of two hoursâ€”thereafter the cloak is non-magical.
> Some rare winter wolf pelts don't require magical enhancements to function as a rimepelt. Without exception the winter wolves whose pelts will exhibit this trait are from wolves with unique attributes, such as heterochromatic eyes.
