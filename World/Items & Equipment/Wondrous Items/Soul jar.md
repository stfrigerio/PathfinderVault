> A ***soul jar*** is used to capture [[Soul|souls]] either by creatures with a soul bind magical ability or by transferring the soul from a black sapphire that contained a soul as a result of the *soul bind* spell. If transferred from the sapphire by holding it against the jar's lid, the sapphire is destroyed half of the time. The jar can contain one soul. A *resurrection* spell can bring back to life someone whose soul is trapped in the *soul jar*.
