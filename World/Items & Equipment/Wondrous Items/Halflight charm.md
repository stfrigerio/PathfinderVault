> A ***halflight charm*** is a magical pendant which is issued to travellers along the [[Halflight Path]] by their [[Duskwarden]] guides. It consists of a glowing crystal on the end of a leather thong, creating light equivalent to a torch.
> The Halflight Path is a dangerous route. Once per day, a traveller in trouble can clutch the charm and issue a mental call for help that will be heard by the three closest Duskwardens within a mile radius. The Duskwardens are also given magical knowledge of the traveller's location. The traveller then has to try to stay alive until rescue arrives.


## *Greater halflight charm*

> A ***greater halflight charm*** is reserved for only those who have significantly impressed the Duskwardens, for instance, saving one of their lives. These items are never knowingly sold or traded as they hold a respect and cachet amongst the organization. 
> The enhanced *charm* benefits the wearer's senses: allowing them to react more quickly to threats, and to see in the dark. Once per year, a wearer may immediately [[Magic/Conjuration|teleport]] their nominated Duskwarden, fully equipped, to wherever they are.
