> *Unguent of revivification* is commonly used in [[Geb's Rest]], a nation ruled by [[Undead|undead]] creatures, to give dead flesh the appearance of life. It serves as a cheaper alternative to the [[Spell|spell]] *gentle repose*. Each dose prevents the dead from beginning to decompose for up to six days. However, this unguent can only prevent further decay and does not reverse any decay that has already begun.
