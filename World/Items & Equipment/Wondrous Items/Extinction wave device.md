> The **extinction wave device** is a remotely detonated [[Bomb|bomb]] that emits reality-warping [[Radiation|radiation]] when activated. This extinction wave kills virtually all living creatures in its area of effect, while still heavily crippling those that somehow manage to survive. Mindless creatures like [[Vermin|vermin]] are, however, completely unaffected by the extinction wave. The extinction wave can only be blocked by force barriers and metals alloyed with [[Djezet 1|djezet]]. An extinction wave device's size and area of effect depend on its intended target.
