> A ***bag of holding*** is a [[Magic item|magical bag]] containing an [[Extradimensional|extradimensional]] space, allowing it to hold a larger volume than its dimensions should permit. There are several different types of *bags of holding*, with the more powerful bags able to hold a larger amount than the less powerful ones. It is possible to accidentally destroy a *bag of holding* either by overloading it or by physically piercing it. It is also possible to briefly keep a live creature within a *bag of holding* but if not removed quickly they will soon suffocate.
> Like other extradimensional containers, a *bag of holding* ceases to work while in another extradimensional space, with the exception of a *portable hole*. A *bag of holding* can tear a [[Planar rift|planar rift]] or create a [[Portal|portal]] to the [[Astral Plane]] when combined with a *portable hole*, a process which destroys both items.This happens in a single blink of an eye.
> Flipping a *bag of holding* inside out will eject items harmlessly, but the bag needs to be flipped back to normal again after doing this or it is unable to work.
