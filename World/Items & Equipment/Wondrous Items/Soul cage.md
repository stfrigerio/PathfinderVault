> A ***soul cage*** is a [[Magic item|magical]] box that contains within various texts written on parchment created by a powerful [[Arcane magic|arcane]] or [[Divine magic|divine]] [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]] in order to house their [[Soul|soul]] in preparation to become a [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|lich]]. The prospective lich must invest considerable time researching and building their *soul cage*, as it will house their soul and bequeath it functional [[Immortality|immortality]]. *Soul cages* are the most infamous of all [[Phylactery|phylacteries]].



## Description

> *Soul cages* often take the shape of sealed [[Metal|metal]] boxes that house strips of parchment upon which magical phrases are inscribed, but are also commonly [[Gem|gems]], although any object can serve.


## Construction

> *Soul cages* are incredibly expensive to produce, costing upwards of 120,000 [[Gold piece|gold pieces]]. If a lich is destroyed, but their *soul cage* is not, the lich will simply reform in one to ten days near their *soul cage*, most likely with an intense desire to kill the person or people that caused its temporary demise. The lich, therefore, makes certain to hide the *soul cage* very carefully, as her immortality depends upon it.


## Other *soul cages*

> In place of a *soul cage*, [[Psychic lich|psychic liches]] create a physical object, called a **memoir**, which projects their personal accomplishments into the [[Astral Plane]] and tethers this astral echo through the [[Plane|planes]]. Psychic liches can only be destroyed by using their memoir as a focus to erase their astral legend.


### *Phylactery of the failed*

> A *phylactery of the failed* is the vessel for the soul of a creature that failed in their bid to become a lich.
