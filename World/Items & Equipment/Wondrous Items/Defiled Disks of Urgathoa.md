> The ***Defiled Disks of Urgathoa*** are a vile relic sacred to the followers of [[Urgathoa]]. Hidden inside the ruins of the [[Saoc Brethren|Saoc Brethrens]] flooded city of [[Oagon]] in the [[Sodden Lands]], the *Defiled Disks* were recovered by a team of smugglers hired by Bartavious Vlade of [[Absalom]] before being stolen by the notorious [[Cheliax|Chelish]] [[Pirate|pirate]] [[Caradoc Alazario]].
> The *Defiled Disks of Urgathoa* consist of four pitted bronze disks each about the size of a [[Human|human]] fist. Tethered together by the huge entrails of some unknown beast, they are covered in obscene tableaux that depict vile [[Ritual|rituals]] dedicated to Urgathoa. The *Defiled Disks* were given to [[Dason]] as a reward for penning the Urgathoan unholy text *[[Serving Your Hunger]]*. Occult texts state that during [[Star|starless]], [[Moon|moonless]] nights the disks merge into a single large bronze plate and any worshipper can gain the favor of the [[Goddess|goddess]] herself by eating a sinister meal from this plate.
