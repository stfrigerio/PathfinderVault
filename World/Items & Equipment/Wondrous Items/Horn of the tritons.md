> The **horn of the tritons** is a magical conch shell horn that, when blown, can calm troubled waters, banish [[Water elemental|water elementals]], summon [[Shark|sharks]], or inflict fear upon aquatic beasts. It also calls the attention of all [[Triton|tritons]] within three miles. Its magic can be used once per day, except by tritons, who can use it three times per day.
