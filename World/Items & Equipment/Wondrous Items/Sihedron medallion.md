> A **Sihedron medallion** is an [[Artifact|artifact]] from the ancient empire of [[Thassilon]].  It is generally found in the form of a silver disk and worn around the neck on a leather cord.  The medallions come in many sizes, tailored to the creatures to whom they belong.  The disk is inscribed with the [[Sihedron rune]], a seven-pointed star which symbolized the [[Seven virtues of rule|seven virtues of rule]] of early Thassilon.  With the decline of the empire the rune became more closely associated with the seven vices and with rune magic in general.
> The medallion gives the wearer increased resistance to many forms of danger and allows him or her to draw temporary life force from it.  If placed on a dead body, a Sihedron medallion will keep the body from decomposing.  What few suspect is that they also serves as a [[Magic/Divination|scrying]] connection for the [[Runelords|runelords]] of Thassilon.
> It is known that these medallions are used by followers of the runelords to identify each other, as they are generally only given out to trusted individuals.
