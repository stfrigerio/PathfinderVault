> The nine ***Cubes of Nex*** were created by [[Nex person|archmage Nex]] himself during his endless wars with [[Geb (person)|Geb]]. The legends say that the *Cubes of Nex* were the first *[[World/Items & Equipment/Wondrous Items/Cube of force|cubes of force]]*.
> It is believed that Nex kept the ***Cube of Nex*** for himself, and gifted one to each of his eight most loyal [[Wizard|wizards]]. The powers of the *Cube of Nex* were a closely guarded secret, but rumor has it that, with his cube, Nex could block incoming [[Magic|magic]] at will while still casting [[Spell|spells]] outward. The eight Cubes of Nex are designed to thwart spells from one of the eight [[Schools of magic|schools of magic]], even when not activated and block its opposition school so as not to interfere with the spellcasting. Each one does so in a different way.
> The ***abjuration cube*** has the ability to negate [[PathfinderWiki/Magic/Abjuration|abjuration]] magic in its vicinity. The ***conjuration cube*** banishes summoned creatures, extraplanar creatures, and [[Magic/Conjuration|conjured]] creations. The ***divination cube*** makes everything within 5 feet of the *cube* completely undetectable to [[Magic/Divination|divination]] spells. The ***enchantment cube*** renders the possessor completely immune to [[Magic/Enchantment|enchantments]]. The ***evocation cube*** acts as a 10-foot-square antimagic field for the purposes of [[Magic/Evocation|evocation]] spells. The ***illusion cube*** allows the possessor to see things as if using *true seeing*. The ***necromancy cube*** causes all mindless [[Undead|undead]] in its vicinity to crumble to dust. The ***transmutation cube*** automatically dispels any [[Transmutation|transmutation]] effects.
> The *Cube of Nex* vanished with Nex and has not been seen since. Of the remaining eight cubes, three have stayed in [[Nex]].
> The *evocation*, *necromancy*, and *transmutation cubes* reside in the palace of [[Bandeshar]] in [[Quantium]]. The ruling [[Council of Three and Nine]] have found the location of the *abjuration*, *conjuration* and *enchantment cubes* but the *divination* and *illusion cubes* are lost. The Three and Nine have been unable to find any information about these *cubes*.
> The *abjuration cube* is currently in the possession of [[Dominicus Rell]], the secretive master of the [[Lion Blades]] of [[Taldor]].
> The *conjuration cube* rests in a cave high in the [[Menador Mountains]] of northern [[Cheliax]]. The cave is guarded by a large contingent of [[Devil|devils]] but none of the devils can enter the cave to retrieve the *conjuration cube*.
> The *enchantment cube* resides in the [[Magic item|magic item]] collection of the [[Pathfinder Society]]'s [[Grand Lodge]] in [[Absalom]].
