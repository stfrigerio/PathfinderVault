> ***Ioun stones***, also known as ***aeon stones***, are magically charged [[Gemstone|gemstones]] that, when activated by an intelligent creature, levitate in a spinning manner around the head of its user. They have various effects, depending on the shape and color of the stone.



## History

> Little is known about the history of these magical stones, despite the fact that the [[Pathfinder Society]] has invested significant energy into uncovering their origins. The following scant facts are known about them:

> - The [[Azlanti]] were the first civilization to use the *ioun stones*.
> - The [[Thassilon|Thassilonians]] leveraged Azlanti lore to advance the art form, and developed new techniques around them.
> - No civilization since those two has made any advancements in the technique of creating or modifying these magical stones.
> - The [[Pathfinder Society]] has, however, created an exhaustive catalog of the *ioun stones*.

## Known facts

> The [[Pathfinder Society]] has learned the following facts about these rare magical items:

> - The stones only work on intelligent creatures, but it does not matter if the creature is living or deadâ€”both intelligent [[Undead|undead]] and [[Construct|constructs]] can make use of them.
> - While levitating, the stones cannot support any weight more than their own. It must be able to revolve around the user's head to work, and so creatures without heads cannot use them.
> - While orbiting the user's head, an *ioun stone* will never collide with other stones also in orbit. They are quite hard to strike during combat, and benefit from any magical protections in effect on their users.

## Classifications

> *Ioun stones* can be classified in two primary ways: by shape, and by color.
> They come in a variety of shapes, including disks, ellipsoids, prisms, pyramids, spheres, and spindles.
> They come in a wide variety of colors, including amber, clear, crimson, dark blue, deep red, dull grey, dusty rose, emerald, gamboge, lavender, onyx, white, orange, pale blue, pink, scarlet, and purpose. Each color/shape combination has its own unique powers and abilities.


## Variations

![[Implanted_ioun_stone.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 *Ioun stones* implanted in a person's arm.
> In addition to color and shape, stones can be delineated by the following characteristics as well:

> - Advanced: advanced *ioun stones* are more powerful than regular stones, and fetch extravagant prices on the open market, between 10,000 and 50,000 gold pieces.
> - Cracked: stones that have an obvious crack in them. They typically have weaker power than regular stones.
> - Flawed: these stones have flaws other than cracks, for example irregular faceting or impurities in the crystal. They can have unusual side effects on the user.
> - Scorched: These stones have somehow been depleted, and function less reliably than regular stones.
> - Cursed: little is known about cursed *ioun stones*, but there are rumors of stones that carry horrible curses.

## Implanting *ioun stones*

> The [[Thassilon|Thassilonians]] advanced the science of *ioun stones* by figuring out how to embed the stones directly into the user's flesh. Binding the stone to the user is a lengthy, dangerous process, but once implanted the stone cannot be sundered or targeted or removed while the user is still alive.
