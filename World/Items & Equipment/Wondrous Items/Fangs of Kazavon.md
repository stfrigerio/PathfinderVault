> The ***Fangs of Kazavon*** are one of the [[Seven Relics of Kazavon]], a mighty [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] of the [[4058 AR|41st century AR]].


## After Kazavon's death

> After Kazavon's defeat in [[4058 AR]], the [[Dragon|dragon]] was dismembered by the hero [[Mandraivus]] and his allies to keep him from reforming, but it was not enough. The severed pieces crawled towards each other in an effort to reform the chosen of [[Zon-Kuthon]]. They correctly assumed that although the dragon was dead, his body parts had to be kept separately, and that each contained a dangerous remnant of his [[Evil|evil]] [[Spirit|spirit]].
> The *Fangs* were taken by the [[Shoanti]] [[Shaman|shaman]] [[Coja Eyes-Aflame]] back to his homeland of [[Varisia]], where he traveled among the [[ShoantiTribes of the Shoanti|seven quahs]] seeking guidance. He asked the oldest wise-men of the tribes and consulted with their totem spirits to discover the best way in which to secure the *Fangs*. Coja Eyes-Aflame was eventually led to the [[Grand Mastaba]], an ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] pyramid sacred to his people.
> After pledging his life to keeping the *Fangs* secure, he entered the pyramid and was never heard from again. Knowing that that Grand Mastaba held a great evil, the Shoanti [[Sklar-Quah]] tribe guarded the site for hundreds of years, until the coming of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] forces.


## The *Fangs* reemerge

> In [[4407 AR]], a Chelish expeditionary force defeated and drove off the Shoanti around the Grand Mastaba, founding the settlement of [[Korvosa|Fort Korvosa]]. As the town grew, none of the immigrant inhabitants had the smallest inkling as to the profound evil in their midst, going so far as to build a [[Castle Korvosa|castle]] on the flattened top of the great Grand Mastaba itself.
