> A ***caparison of resistance*** is an [[Magic|enchanted]] [[Caparison|caparison]] intended for [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Horse|horses]] but capable of reshaping itself for any quadruped mount. It protects the mount from danger, and if ridden by a single person, it protects them as well. *Caparisons of resistance* can be crafted in varying levels of effectiveness, which influences its price accordingly.
> They are crafted by the [[Al-Zabriti]], who do not sell them to outsiders. They are sometimes sold in black markets, but outsiders bearing such ill-begotten goods before members of the Al-Zabriti are likely to earn their disdain.
