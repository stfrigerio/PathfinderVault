> ***Lorestones*** are vast [[Magic item|magical]] repositories of [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druidic]] knowledge embedded in small stones. Although different varieties of *lorestones* are known to exist, all share certain features in common: they are engraved with [[Astronomy|astronomical]] objects such as [[Constellation|constellations]] and other celestial objects. Studying *lorestones* provides information on natural phenomena such as weather patterns and seasonal changes, but can also unlock a deeper truth. Those who unlock these truths gain access to the *lorestone's* true powers hidden within.


## Known *lorestones*

> The three known *lorestones* are the ***granite sphere*** (formerly owned by the druid [[Hemzel]] in the [[Verduran Forest]], but currently held by the [[Pathfinder Society]] in [[Andoran]]), the ***gravetaker sphere*** (located somewhere within the territory of a [[Fiendish|fiendish]] [[Quickwood|quickwood]] east of the city of [[Wispil]] in [[Taldor]]), and the ***piscine stone*** (in the possession of a pack of [[Ratfolk|ratfolk]] in the [[River Kingdoms]]).
