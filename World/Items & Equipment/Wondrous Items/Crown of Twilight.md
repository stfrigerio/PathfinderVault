> The **Crown of Twilight** was held for centuries in one of [[Zon-Kuthon|Zon-Kuthons]]'s [[Star Tower|Star Towers]] in the [[Vale of Shadows]] in the [[Five Kings Mountains]]. The *Crown* was part of a set of equipment for use against minions of [[Rovagug]] were any to escape from their prisons; there was, in addition to the *Crown*, a lance, and a suit of scale armour. These three items were kept in a temple of [[Shelyn]], the sister of Zon-Kuthon, within the Star Tower. In appearance, the *Crown* consists of two interlaced bands of [[Metal|metal]]: one of [[Gold|white-gold]] and one of a deep black metal arranged in a wave-like pattern. The two bands are separable.
> The *Crown* had been coveted by the [[Shadow wizard|shadow wizards]] of [[Galt]] and [[Taldor]] some decades before but was eventually taken, in [[4711 AR]], by [[Elyana Sadrastis]] in order to [[Healing|cure]] [[Stelan|Baron Stelan]] of a [[Curse|curse]] placed on him by the [[Wizard|wizard]] [[Arcil]]. Almost immediately, however, the *Crown* was stolen from Elyana by [[Vallyn]], the [[Bard's End|bard]], for his mistress [[Nadara]], who planned to use the *Crown* to gain power in the Galtan hierarchy. Eventually, the *Crown* was retaken by Elyana.
