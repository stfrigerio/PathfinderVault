> Nightbane is the name of one of the [[Cornucopia]], a relic and symbol of authority in [[Absalom]]. 
> All 12 of the Cornucopia have a name, but such details are jealously guarded secrets by their possessors. Nightbane is the only horn whose name is publicly known (although whether this is the relics true name or simply an unoffical nickname none can confirm). 
Nightbane is described in a famous epic poem that is well known througout Absalom. In 50 rhyming verses, the poem claims Nightbane wakes from its slumber every few centuries only when its homeland is threatened. According to the legend, it also seeks to prevent an endless night from falling over all Golarion, urging that its holder aid it in its task in preventing such a disaster.
> The validity of the poem is questionable at best.
