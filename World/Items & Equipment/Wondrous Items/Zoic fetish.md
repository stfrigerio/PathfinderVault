> A **zoic fetish** grants the bearer mild protection against [[Animal|animals]]. Each unique fetish is crafted from twigs, grass, string, and bone. The bearer can sometimes dominate an animal of the same general type as the fetish, such as reptiles, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]], mammals, [[Fish|fish]], or amphibians. These items were originally crafted by [[Kellid]] shamans of the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], but are now found wherever dangerous animals live.
