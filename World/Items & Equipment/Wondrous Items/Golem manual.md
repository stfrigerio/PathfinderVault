> A ***golem manual*** is a single-use [[Magic item|magic item]] that gives a person the ability to create a particular type of [[Golem|golem]] without the necessary specialized [[Magic|magical]] training. Each manual is filled with instructions, written [[Spell|spells]], and enough magical power to animate one specific type of golem, including shield guardian versions of these golems; each has a unique appearance depending on the golem type. Once a golem is finished, the *golem manual* combusts, and sprinkling the manual's ashes on the golem is the final step needed to animate it.
