> ***Elemental gems*** are small, fragile [[Magic item|magical gemstones]] that come in four varieties: air, earth, fire, and water. When crushed, broken, or otherwise destroyed, they [[Summoning|summon]] a large [[Elemental|elemental]] of the same type as the [[Gem|gem]] that is under the control of the user for a short period of time. This use renders the gem useless. The coloration of each gem differs depending on its type: ***air elemental gems*** are clear, ***fire elemental gems*** are reddish orange, ***water elemental gems*** are blue-green, and ***earth elemental gems*** are brown, although some have been seen in [[Osirion]] that are clay-red. *Elemental gems* are also used in the construction of the much more powerful *elemental rings*.
