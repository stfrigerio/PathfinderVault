*For another meaning of "Wayfinder", please see [[Wayfinder magazine]].*
> A ***wayfinder*** is a [[Magic item|magic item]] used almost exclusively by members of the [[Pathfinder Society]], so much so that the small device is a calling card of sorts for the explorers and chroniclers known as [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]].



## Functionality

> The device functions primarily as a [[Magnetic|magnetic]] compass, and also can emit light on command. It contains at least one slot that fits an *[[Aeon stone|aeon stone]]* (or *ioun stone* as they are sometimes called), and magical wires that channel and amplify the stone's power. Such augmented *ioun stones* conflict with each other, preventing someone from holding multiple augmented *wayfinders*, though some *wayfinders* have multiple independent *aeon stone* slots.
> When a *wayfinder* includes an *aeon stone* in this manner, it also reveals new behaviors that vary between *wayfinders* and *aeon stones*. For instance, [[Eando Kline]]'s *wayfinder*, when fitted in this manner, stopped pointing north, directing the [[Pathfinder]] instead across [[Varisia]] and the [[Hold of Belkzen]] toward an unknown location.


## Design

![[Hummingbird_Wayfinder.png|right+hmed]] 
 A *hummingbird wayfinder* incorporates [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] elements into its design.
> *Wayfinder* designs are derived from ancient [[Azlant|Azlanti]] [[Artifact|artifacts]], and a few such Azlanti devices still exist. While most experienced magical crafters can build a new *wayfinder*, many date back decades or even centuries and are handed down across generations. Their appearance and design has become standardized over the centuries of the Pathfinder Society's existence, and most modern wayfinders are virtual duplicates of each other. Older models of wayfinders that vary greatly in their look and design, known as archaic wayfinders can still be found in the hands of collectors, or at the bottom of forgotten pit traps.


### Manufacture

> Most modern *wayfinders* are manufactured in the Society's [[Oppara Lodge]], by the lodge steward and arcane crafter [[Muesello]].


### Variants

> Particularly rare among *wayfinders* are those crafted outside of the standard-issue specifications. An *ebon wayfinder*, for example, allows its wielder to see in the dark and spread magical *darkness*.
