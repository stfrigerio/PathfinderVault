> Magical ***goz masks*** were introduced to the [[Sodden Lands]] by priests of [[Gozreh]], specifically a sect known as the [[Storm Kindlers]], who were attempting to repair the devastation caused by the [[Eye of Abendego]]. The priests failed their self-appointed task, and the frightening masks have since fallen into the hands of the chieftains of the [[Koboto]], survivors of the drowned nation of [[Yamasa]].
> The power of the masks enable the wearer to freely navigate the flooded landscape, seeing through fog and smoke. They also grant the ability to breathe water for a short period, and to resist the effects of high winds.
