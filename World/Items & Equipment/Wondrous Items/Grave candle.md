> A **Grave candle**, when lit, magically brings forth a spirit from its corpse enabling the living to interrogate the dead soul but only for a few questions: the time taken for the candle wick to burn. The spirit appears in the cloud of thick smoke created by the candle looking similar to its appearance while alive.
