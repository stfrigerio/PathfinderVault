> Currently manufactured by [[Necromancer|necromancers]] within the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]], a **death's head talisman** is an amulet to control a limited amount of undead specific to each amulet.  The creation of these undead is part of the item's creation process, and the talisman cannot control undead brought about through other means. This control is only present when the talisman is worn; undead revert to their normal behavior if it is ever taken off. If the undead tied to the talisman are ever destroyed, the death's head talisman becomes powerless and worthless as well.
