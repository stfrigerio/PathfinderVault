> The [[Mechanics/Spells/Spells/Level 1/Magic Weapon|magic]] brass [[Scimitar|scimitar]] known as ***Brazen Claw*** is considered a holy relic to the [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] of the [[Brazen Peaks]]. 
> While all gnolls believe they were created by their [[God|goddess]] [[Lamashtu]], the gnolls of the Brazen Peaks believe that she clawed her chosen creature from the very earth of the Brazen Peaks. According to this legend, the tip of one of her claws broke off in the earth and was later found by the gnolls, and from this shard they created the *Brazen Claw*. 
> The weapon was used to great effect by the gnoll leader [[Rath Sandstalker]] at the [[Siege of Solku]], though rumor has it the mighty gnoll has since lost the weapon. One rumor places it in the hands of the mercenary [[Marrow Reavers]], which would infuriate Rath if true.
