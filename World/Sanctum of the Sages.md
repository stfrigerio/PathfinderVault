> The **Sanctum of the Sages** is an underground complex set into a mountain in the [[Pillars of the Sun]] range of [[Osirion]], and was once used as the headquarters and sanctuary of the ancient order of [[Jeweled Sages]]. The complex was abandoned centuries ago with the dispersal of the original Jeweled Sages, but its traps and magically [[Construct|constructed]] guards remain active.
