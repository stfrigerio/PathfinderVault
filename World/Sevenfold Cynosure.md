> The **Sevenfold Cynosure** is the home of the [[Deity|goddess]] [[Desna]]. This crystalline palace is located at the heart of the [[Demiplane|demiplane]] [[Cynosure]], which manifests on the [[Material Plane]] as the pole [[Star|star]] of [[Golarion]], and serves as the navigational north in the demiplane. The palace constantly shifts to match Desna's whims, but visitors always perceive it like a perfect dream. Desna can also cause it to simultaneously manifest in [[Elysium]], when she visits that [[Plane|plane]] in her wanderings, where it appears as a small, floating castle or villa, or as the crystalline mountain palace seen in Cynosure.
