## History

> For the native Hallasians, whose features combined [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snake]], [[Cephalopod|cephalopod]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird]], life on Hallas was easy, as they had few natural predators. They developed a system of [[Magic|magic]] without any [[Teleportation|teleportation]], as to them, the idea of leaving Hallas was unthinkable. Instead, they focused on improving themselves, and more than a millennium ago, they succeeded, becoming creatures of pure energy. Around the same time, they made first contact with the people of [[Arkanen]], whose minds were burnt to death by [[Telepathy|telepathic]] contact with the Hallasians' searing consciousness. Arkanen's greatest [[Wizard|wizards]] and [[Divine magic|divine spellcasters]] then set up a magical cordon around Hallas to warn travellers and imprison the predators. This cordon has remained active to the present day, but is completely unnecessary, as the Hallasians have no desire to travel.
