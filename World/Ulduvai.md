> **Ulduvai** was the last of the [[Shory Empire|Shory]] flying cities in [[Garund]] and the [[Inner Sea region]]. In a misguided effort to restore the Shory Empire, the [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]] of Ulduvai consorted with the powers of the [[Dark Tapestry]], which ended up with the entire population being driven [[Insanity|mad]] by a [[Shoggoth|shoggoth]] servant of [[Azathoth]], and the city crashing upon Mirrshock Glacier in the southeastern [[Mwangi Expanse]], south of [[Mount Dowama]] in the [[Shattered Range]].
> Three ancient Shory [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]] survived to the present, albeit as undead creatures: [[Yakmar]], the insane adventurer-mage; [[Yithdul]], the arcane diplomat; and [[Banderak]], former head of the city's [[Aeromantic Infadibulum|aeromantic]] corps.
