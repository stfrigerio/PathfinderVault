> **Norinor** is a large, sheltered forest in southern [[Iobaria]] that borders the [[Hills of Nomen]] and [[Syrzemyan Highlands]]. The dangers and riches of the forest are well known as Norinor plays home to more [[Human|human]] settlements and "hideholds" than any other forest within Iobaria. However many of these settlers are rugged individualists pursuing their own ends, with towns like [[Volod]] along the [[Noyrus River]] the exception rather than the rule. 
> There is no cohesive community within Norinor, many of its inhabitants only know those who live within a few miles of their homesteads, unless they have a reason to travel. While these folk do not readily come to each others' defences, they do warn their fellows when outsiders, such as press gangs from [[Kridorn]], enter the woods.
