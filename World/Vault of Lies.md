> The **Vault of Lies** is a hidden storage area in the [[Pure Legion]]'s citadel of [[Shepherd's Rock|Shepherds Rock]] in [[Rahadoum]]. It contains the Legion's vast store of confiscated religious texts, kept here in order that the Legion may study their enemy.
> If the citadel was ever besieged by the forces of the religious, standing orders are that the Vault's contents should be destroyed by fire.
