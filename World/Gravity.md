> **Gravity**, or **gravitation**, is a natural physical phenomenon by which all things with mass or energy—including [[Planet|planets]], [[Star|stars]], [[Galaxy|galaxies]], and even light—are brought toward (or *gravitate* toward) one another. Gravity is the phenomenon that gives weight to physical objects and a [[Plane|planar]] property whose fundamental strength and behavior can vary across and within each plane.



## In the Great Beyond

> Gravity's behavior on each plane can vary based on location, localized natural and [[Magic|magical]] phenomena, physics-based interactions between objects, or completely at random.


### On the Material Plane

> For residents of [[Golarion]] and most other massive [[Celestial body|celestial bodies]], gravity draws objects toward the object's center. This gives inhabitants a sense of up and down. The strength of this force is considered a baseline for those who travel between worlds of different mass; gravity on other worlds might make objects feel relatively heavier or lighter, or it might be absent and result in total weightlessness.
> The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Material Plane caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars—and for the stars to group together into galaxies—so gravity is responsible for many of the plane's large-scale natural structures. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects. For instance, the [[Moon|Moons]] gravity causes or influences ocean tides on Golarion.


### On other planes

> Planes might have different baseline gravitational strength from the Material Plane, including a complete lack of gravity. Localized gravity might also change in strength and directly, resulting in sensations of up and down changing dramatically. Gravity on certain planes might also act at unusual angles, for instance making the ground feel like an unending incline.
> In planes with subjective directional gravity, individuals can define those directions for themselves, which allows them to effectively fly by controlling where and how they "fall" relative to their position.


## Manipulation

> Gravity can be manipulated by sufficiently powerful magic as well as through [[Graviton technology|graviton technology]].


### Via magic

> [[Spell|Spells]], often from the [[Transmutation|transmutation]] school, can alter gravitational properties near a [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]], while other spells such as *levitate* and *freedom of movement* inherently violate gravity.


### Via technology

> Graviton technology creates localized gravitational phenomena. For example, a gravity rifle focuses gravitons into a [[Beam weapon|beam]] that can alter gravity only for the objects struck by the beam, allowing its wielder to move or push heavy objects at will, and gravity clips attached to a weapon can make it strike with the apparent force of a much denser object.
