> The **Godless Gallery** is hosted in the [[Hellknights|Hellknight]] [[Citadel Krane]]. The citadel is the fortress-headquarters of the Hellknight [[Order of the Pyre]], and can be found south of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Ostenso]] on [[Cape Erebus]]. The Godless Gallery is a museum of unholy artifacts and cultic writings that either defy destruction or hold the potential to be turned against their blasphemous creators. Priestly signifers protect the library, granting access only to the order's lictor, master of blades, and paravicar.
