> The **Northmounds** were a region of central [[Sarkoris]] which was known for its many tombs and barrow mounds. It appeared that the barriers between the [[Plane|planes]] were weak in this region, and numerous strange creatures could be found here.
> The cult of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Deskari]], lord of the Locust Host, was strong in the region, and menaced the folk of Sarkoris until [[Aroden]] drove the cultists into the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]].
> The Northmounds were peaceful for many centuries, until the death of Aroden. At that time, the gate to the [[Abyss]] known as the [[Worldwound]] erupted in the region, transforming the Northmounds into a vile, twisted landscape, called the [[Wounded Lands]], and spewing forth a horde of [[Demon|demons]] which destroyed Sarkoris.
