> The **Sparkling Principality of Hautansia** is one of the numerous [[Mephit|mephit]] kingdoms that dot the [[Plane of Air]] but is infamous for the cruelty of its ruler and the incredible jewels its mines produce. The Sparkling Principality consists of a series of huge rocky islands melded together by vast amounts of solid ice. Hautansia is ruled over by a powerful [[Ice mephit|ice mephit]] [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]] known as [[Eshakhar I|His Frozen Majesty King Eshakhar I]]. Eshakhar uses his mastery of ice magic to keep the ice that makes up Hautansia intact and his minions loyal. Hautansia is mainly comprised of ice mephits but it uses larger slaves, often captured from passing airships, to work its mines in the heart of the rocky isles. While the Sparkling Principality of Hautansia is at best a minor power of the Plane of Air, the rarity and quality of the jewels that come from these mines means that far more powerful rulers are forced to send envoys and diplomats to negotiate with king Eshakhar I. Due to Eshakhar I's prickly demeanour and evil nature these negotiators must be extremely careful about showing the king proper respect, those who don't are frozen into solid blocks of ice which Eshakhar then carves into twisted sculptures of chiselled ice and cleaved flesh.
