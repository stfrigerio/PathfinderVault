> **Jashoi** are [[Halflings|halflings]] transformed by the [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]] process into insane, scampering beasts with four legs. The [[Drow|drow]] rarely create jashoi as even they find the jashoi annoying and unmanageable.
> Jashoi appear to have permanent grins and have spines that arch painfully and show through tight skin. However, they are still recognizable as the halfling they were. They screech and scream near constantly. They may have kept a few known words, but use them unintelligibly, perhaps like they just remember the sounds. They are no more intelligent than an [[Ape|ape]].
