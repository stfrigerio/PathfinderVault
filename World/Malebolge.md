 A vision of Malebolge.
> **Malebolge** (pronounced MAL-eh-bulge) is the sixth layer of [[Hell]], and is ruled by [[Moloch]], general of Hell's armies.  Those who have visited this forsaken place describe it as a great forest, onto which snow-like ash is constantly falling.
> It is within the indomitable pits and fortresses of this [[Plane|plane]] that the fiendish beasts known as [[Malebolgian cerberi]] are bred and trained.
