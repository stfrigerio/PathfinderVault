> The **Undercroft** is an enclave of the city of [[Kalsgard]], the *de facto* capital of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. It lies under the city in its foundations, and many entrances to it are found in the [[Oak Quarter]] of the city. Many [[Dwarf|dwarves]] live in this underground quasi-district.
