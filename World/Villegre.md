> **Villegre** serves as the academic heart of [[Kintargo]] and is centred around the once world-famous [[Alabaster Academy]]. The district is also home to numerous other schools, academies, and institutions, including [[Lady Docur's School for Girls|Lady Docurs School for Girls]], and the host of businesses that have sprung up to support them.
> The glory days of Villegre are long behind it. Since the revelation in [[4599 AR]] that the [[Mangvhune|Temple Hill Slasher]] was a professor at the Alabaster Academy, the university's reputation was irreparably damaged.
