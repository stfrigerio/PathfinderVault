> The **Long Walk** is the only major tunnel linking locations in the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Nar-Voth]] on the continent of [[Avistan]]. It serves as a major trade route in the region, and is regularly patrolled by the [[Duergar|duergar]] of [[Hagegraf]].



## Geography

> The Long Walk begins at Hagegraf, located under the northern [[Five Kings Mountains]], and runs for hundreds of miles in a generally westerly direction, before turning northwest on the western border of [[Molthune]], running below the [[Mindspin Mountains]]. It passes directly below the [[Dwarven|dwarven]] [[Sky Citadel]] of [[Janderhoff]] in eastern [[Varisia]] (a heavily fortified [[Entrances to the Darklands|entrance to Nar-Voth]]), and turns sharply northeastward thereafter, finally ending at the duergar city of [[Fellstrok]] beneath the fallen [[Sky Citadel]] of [[Urgir]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]].


## Trade

> The Long Walk is by far the fastest route through Nar-Voth, which otherwise consists of small tunnels of limited range and utility. With the eastern portion so heavily patrolled by the duergar, this means that it is a popular route for trade caravans, even though the grey dwarves levy a hefty tax on all such traffic.


## Denizens

> Due to the heavy duergar patrols, much of the Long Walk is avoided by the other races prevalent in Nar-Voth, such as the [[Dark fey|dark fey]] and [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]].
