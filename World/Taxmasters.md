> **Taxmasters** enforce the laws that require all to pay their fair share of the community's burden and may use less savory means, including threats and intimidation, to ensure they receive rightful taxes due to the community from tax-dodgers, thieves and fraudsters. It is not unheard of for an enforcer to cause harm in their effort to procure all funds due from the less co-operative members of the community.
> As a result, Taxmasters are generally unpopular and they cover their faces with yellow or golden masks to avoid direct association with their oft-despised role in the community.   
> Despite this sentiment, Taxmasters are often dedicated and older or infirm enforcers continue to serve by conducting legal research and investigations.
