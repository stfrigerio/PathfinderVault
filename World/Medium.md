> The bodies of **mediums** act as vessels for [[Astral Plane|astral]] entities, including spirits of the dead. Mediums channel these spirits through ritualistic seances and can grant spirits even greater influence over their bodies by going into a trance. They are often confused with [[Necromancy|necromancers]] or [[Undead|undead-possessed]] people due to their links to the deceased, and dismissed by [[Arcane|arcane]] and [[Divine|divine]] scholars due to the prevalence of fraudulent mediums.



## Regions

> Mediums are widely misunderstood on [[Golarion]], and outright persecuted in [[Ustalav]] and [[Mendev]] for fears that mediums' psychic powers are drawn from [[Evil|evil]] sources.
> One exception is [[Nex]], which prizes mediums for their ability to channel the nation's [[Nex person|namesake archmage]]. Likewise, mediums are hated and hunted in [[Geb's Rest]] in fear of the medium potentially being an agent of Nex.
> [[Ulfen]] and [[Varisian|Varisians]] both have strong traditions of storytelling and view mediums as capable of bringing their legends to life. Among [[Samsaran|samsarans]], [[Ghoran|ghorans]], and other races and societies that believe in reincarnation, mediums are important conduits of communication with past lives and spirits.


### Nexian channelers

> Even though the archmage Nex simply disappeared, he created an astral reflection capable of serving the same role as a channelable spirit. Such mediums are renowned for mastering their third eye and gaining access to fragments of Nex's powers.


## Races

## Religions
