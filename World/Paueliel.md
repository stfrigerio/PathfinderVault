> **Paueliel trees** (pronouced PAW-ehl-ee-ehl) are silver barked softwoods that grow enormously tall.  With all of this height, the trees always remain skinny, never more than a few feet in diameter. They are known as the 'first trees' by most of the world. Lumberjacks superstitiously think that these trees are related to the [[First World]], giving these trees a wide berth when logging in an area.  There are a few examples of [[Dryad|dryads]] living in paueliel trees, and reports of [[Tatzlwyrm|tatzlwyrms]] living high in the upper branches.
> On the rare occasions that paueliel is harvested and turned into lumber, it is harder than [[Darkwood|darkwood]] and sells for 150% of its price.


## Known Stands of Paueliel

> Paueliel are known to grow in the [[Palakar Forest]] of central [[Druma]], but are cut only occasionally, thanks to the long-term conservation strategies of [[Macridi|Macridis]] lumber mills. They have also been spotted in a section of the [[Arthfell Forest]] known as the Etherveil, in [[Darkmoon Wood]], in the [[Verduran Forest]], and in the [[Echo Wood]] in the [[River Kingdoms]].
