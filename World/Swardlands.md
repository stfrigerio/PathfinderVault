 A [[Donkey|donkey]] pulls a cart through the Swardlands.
> The **Swardlands** are the plains located in the western [[Isle of Kortos]]. The breadbasket of [[Absalom]], they owe their fertility to the four [[Aeon Tower|Aeon Towers]] and their *[[Aeon orb|aeon orbs]]*, which have [[Magic|magically]] sustained their flora since [[Aroden]] raised the Isle of Kortos from the [[Inner Sea]]. Since Aroden's death, two of the Aeon Towers have failed, and it is unknown how the remaining ones can endure before Kortos' agricultural bounty fails.


## Encroaching disaster

> The Swardlands are not only threatened by the lack of agricultural productivity due to the Aeon Towers' loss of power, but also by the ever-expanding Welt. This blight begins at the western edge of the [[Dunmire]], and continues to expand to the west at a pace of a mile a year.
