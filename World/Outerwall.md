> **Outerwall** surrounds the three colonial districts of [[Anthusis|Eleder]] with a nearly one mile width zone of tightly packed, crude, mud-daub huts and dusty, rat-infested streets. Its population dwarfs that of the rest of the city and most of them lack even the most basic necessities. Crime, begging, vagrancy, hunger, and disease are endemic.
