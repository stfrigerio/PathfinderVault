> **The Devil's Threads** is one of the many tailor's shops located adjacent to the [[Redroof Market]] in the [[Redroof]] district of [[Kintargo]]. The Devil's Thread is a quaint little shop that is differentiated from most other such shops by its owner: a [[Tiefling|tiefling]] named [[Hetamon Haace]]. Anywhere else in [[Cheliax]], Hetamon's [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] heritage would have worked against him but, in Kintargo, his skills were allowed to shine. Unbeknownst to almost everyone, Hetamon Haace is a secret worshipper of [[Milani]] and one of the few surviving members of the Rose of Kintargo.
