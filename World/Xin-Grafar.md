**Xin-Grafar**, the **City of Golden Death**, is the lost, underground treasure city of [[Tar-Baphon|Tar-Baphon the Whispering Tyrant]], located on the [[Isle of Terror]]. Originally named **Kestrillon**, it was a thriving metropolis and center of [[Magic|magical]] research, protected by the now-destroyed Grafar Citadel. Tar-Baphon conquered it and renamed it Xin-Grafar in the style of ancient [[Thassilon]], then made Xin-Grafar his treasure city and hid his vast wealth there behind a legion of guardians and traps. Later, Tar-Baphon created the Wizard-King's Pit in Xin-Grafar to entrap [[Aroden]], but the [[Deity|god]] thwarted his trap and destroyed the Whispering Tyrant. The Pit remained open, connecting the once-beautiful island to the [[Negative Energy Plane]] as it fell into ruin.
> Xin-Grafar is located in a vast underground cavern lit by greenish phosphorescence and surrounded by canals of molten [[Gold|gold]]. It is built on three tiers encircled by circular walls: the First, Second, and Third Rings. All of the buildings in the First and Second Rings are plated with gold due to recurring floods from the molten canals.


> The adventure *[[City of Golden Death]]* takes place in Xin-Grafar and includes a map of the city.
