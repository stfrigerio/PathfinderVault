> The **Sugimatu family**, or **Sugimatu clan**, was one of the five Imperial Families of [[Minkai]], families blessed with the right to rule Minkai by the divine [[Deity|goddess]] [[Shizuru]] herself. The Sugimatu were traditionally peacemakers and normally had a very strong connection to the people they ruled over. Sugimatu rulers have been called things like "Empress of Pleasant Rains", "Emperor of the Sake Sea", and "the Six Springs Empress", reflecting the times of peace and prosperity that accompanied their rule. Many of the Sugimatu family were [[Poisons of Golarion|poisoned]] by the [[Oni|oni]] of the Five Storms.
