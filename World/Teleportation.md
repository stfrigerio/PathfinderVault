*This article is about the generic act of transporting a person or object instantly from one place to another. For the subschool of [[Magic/Conjuration|conjuration]], see [[Teleportation subschool]]. For permanent magical links between locations or [[Plane|planes]], see [[Portal|portal]]. For the spell, see *[[Teleport spell|teleport spell]]*.*
> **Teleportation** is the transfer of matter or energy from one point to another without traversing the physical space between them. It is most often accomplished through [[Magic|magical]] means of [[Planar travel|traversing]] the [[Astral Plane|Astral]] or [[Ethereal Plane|Ethereal]] planes, particularly via [[Spell|spells]] like *[[Teleport spell|teleport]]* and similar spells in the [[Teleportation subschool|Teleportation]] subschool of [[Magic/Conjuration|conjuration magic]], as well as abilities related to certain [[Domain|domains]], divine gifts, or [[Oracle|oracular]] [[Mystery|mysteries]] of [[Divine magic|divine magic]].
> Permanently applied teleportation effects are sometimes referred to as **teleporters**.






## Restrictions

![[Blightburn.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Blightburn]] is highly disruptive to teleportation.
> Teleportation is almost always a one-way process and cannot be dispelled or inherently undone.


### Safety

> Objects and creatures cannot be teleported into other objects or creatures, and teleportation spells by design must have a clear, supported surface as a target. Intentional teleportation attempts into life-threatening environments always fail. However, some permanent teleporters might still attempt to teleport creatures or objects to a location that was once safe but has since been destroyed, resulting in especially inconvenient or dangerous results.


### Teleportation mishaps

> Magical teleportation also often requires the [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]] to at least be familiar with the destination in order to teleport to it; a lack of knowledge about the destination can result in failure, teleporting to an unexpected destination, or a painful [[Teleportation mishap|teleportation mishap]]. This familiarity can be gained simply by reading a map of the destination.


### Planar travel

> While a few rare instance of teleportation magic can cross [[Plane|planar]] boundaries beyond the [[Transitive plane|transitive planes]], most cannot. Teleportation is also subject to any restrictions against travel to or from the Astral Plane.


### Created by spells

> Certain spells specifically interdict or prevent teleportation, such as *dimensional anchor*, *dimensional lock*, and *forbiddance*.


### Summoned creatures

> [[Summon|Summoned]] creatures cannot be teleported, nor can they use any teleportation abilities they might possess.


### Resistance

> Some forms of teleportation can be used against unwilling subjects, though they can sometimes resist being teleported.


### Disabling and interdiction

> Certain spells like *teleportation circle* can sometimes be disabled through mundane means similar to trap disarmament, and permanent teleporters can be linked to devices that can enable and disable them. Some locations have wards against teleportation, such as the [[Jyoti|jyoti]] city of [[Arudrellisiir]] on the [[Positive Energy Plane]], which intercepts all unsanctioned teleportation attempts and redirects their passengers into prison cells.
> [[Blightburn]] prevents all but the most powerful magical teleportation in its presence, and is always highly disruptive even when its effects can be overpowered. Certain auras can also anchor or interdict planar travel, including teleportation, with often painful results.


### Range

> Many teleportation effects have a limited range, whether a fixed distance or a sensory limit, such as line of sight. However, these limits can sometimes be astronomical in scale—for example, spells such as *interplanetary teleport* can move creatures and objects from one [[Planet|planet]] to another.
> When invoking teleportation effects that can be shared with or imposed onto others, they most often require direct physical contact with the objects or creatures being teleported.


### Scope

> Most methods of teleportation are limited to a single creature and objects it wears or carries. Stronger versions can be shared with a few others. But a few rare and truly epic forms of teleportation can move entire buildings, and sometimes even parts of other lands, from one place to another. For instance, magically powerful city planners might use teleportation magic move entire unoccupied buildings across a city district.


## Side effects

> Teleportation is often inherently disorienting, though some methods (such as the *dimension door* spell) are more disorienting than others.


## Alternative methods

> [[Rules/Classes/Druid|Druidic]] magic allows a form of teleportation via two different living [[Plant|plants]] of the same type, regardless of their distance apart. Similar magic can also allow for teleportation-like travel by entering and exiting different trees of the same species.
> The [[Illusion|illusion]] spell *shadow step* provides a teleportation-like effect from one dim or dark shadow to another.
> Several types of magical specialists, including non-spellcasters, have innate teleportation abilities. For example, certain types of [[Magus|magi]] can teleport a bound or specific item, such as a [[Weapon|weapon]], to their hand. Certain types of [[PathfinderWiki/Ranger|rangers]], [[Investigator|investigators]], and even [[Fighter|fighters]] who are exceptional planar scholars have access to teleportation abilities.
> While [[Portal|portals]] are distinguished from teleportation by their permanence and broader potential planar reach, some people have mastered the use of short-lived portals to effectively teleport short distances.
> The edges of an unbounded plane will teleport any who attempt to cross them to their opposite edge.


## On Golarion

![[Lady%27s_Light.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 The [[Lady's Light|Ladys Light]] features permanent teleporters.
> The [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] ruins of [[Crystilan]] are encased in crystal that prevents teleportation to the city visible within.
> The [[College of Dimensional Studies]] in [[Katapesh]] lacks doors between its rooms, requiring its students to be capable of teleportation and other transport magic.
> The *[[Sun orchid elixir|sun orchid elixir]]* is sometimes transported via teleportation magic, although this is considered taboo due to repeat mishaps.
> The interior of the Adella Necropolis is riddled with permanent teleporters and other forms of teleportation magic, while also restricting teleportation into the Necropolis from outside. The [[Lady's Light|Ladys Light]], a statue of ancient Thassilon, also contains many permanent teleporters.
> The *[[Wardstone|wardstones]]* of [[Mendev]] are designed to prevent teleportation across its borders.
> [[Wizard|Wizards]] deliver supplies to [[Kyonin]] from outside its borders via teleportation.


### In magic items

> Teleportation abilities can also be imbued in [[Magic item|magic items]], such as [[Scroll|scrolls]], clothes, [[Ring|rings]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]]. Such items can reproduce a teleportation spell's abilities in whole or with certain limits, such as binding its target to the location of a specific creature.
> When damaged, the *[[Harrow Deck of Many Things]]* teleports to a random location elsewhere on a single plane of existence. One of its cards, the Desert, can teleport a group and a ton of items to a known destination with enough power to bypass most barriers against teleportation.
> The *[[Orbs of Dragonkind|brass dragon orb]]* is imbued with a powerful *teleport* spell.
> Annually on or near 20th [[Pharast]], *[[Saint Cuthbert's Mace|Saint Cuthberts Mace]]* can teleport anywhere within a plane, or shift across planes, to appear where those who fight for [[Lawful good|law and good]] need it the most.
> *[[Shin-Tari]]*, one of the [[Seven Swords of Sin]], can teleport a creature that it wounds.
> *[[Vesper's Rapier|Vespers Rapier]]* grants its wielder limited teleportation abilities.


### In religion

> [[Alseta]], [[Elven pantheon|elven deity]] of doors and portals, is often (if unofficially) considered the patron deity of teleportation.


## In the Great Beyond

> A rare side effect of a teleportation maneuver used by [[Shield archon|shield]] and [[Lantern archon|lantern]] [[Archon|archons]] results in the explosive creation of a [[Bastion archon|bastion archon]].
> Mobile [[Valharut|valharut]] [[Inevitable|inevitables]] use teleportation at will to move quickly across a battlefield.
> [[Sahkil|Sahkils]] are masters of teleportation, and parts of [[Phantasmagoria's Maw|Phantasmagorias Maw]]—the entrance to their realm of [[Xibalba]]—is inaccessible without teleportation.
