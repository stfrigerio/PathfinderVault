> The **rod of the river serpent** is an item of the serpent cult of the chaotic, destructive [[Apep]], carved to resemble his fanged head. It can be wielded as a magical heavy mace, and grants other powers to wielders who are devoted to chaos. For them, it allows the wielder to see in the dark and create hypnotic patterns of shadows. With a powerful blow, it will animate to swallow opponents whole into a crushing extradimensional stomach.
