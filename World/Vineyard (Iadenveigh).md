> The **communal vineyard** of the [[Numeria|Numerian]] town of [[Iadenveigh]] is located on the slopes of the Brow: the rocky hill at the centre of the town. The town's vineyard is famous for the production of [[Alcoholic beveragesBrow Brew|Brow Brew]]: an oddity amongst beers, as it is produced primarily from *grapes* harvested from this vineyard. These tough grapes are practically inedible, but are fermented with a particular yeast, grain and wood mushrooms to make a distinctive and rough beer considered an 'acquired taste' by visitors to the town.
