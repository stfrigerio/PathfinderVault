> **Voiporl** is the infernal realm of the [[Whore queen|whore queen]] [[Mahathallah]], located in the caverns between [[Phlegethon]] and [[Stygia]]. It is contained entirely within vast caves, whose ceilings are in certain locations rent open to reveal dizzying alien [[Constellation|constellations]]. The floors of the caverns are filled by a violet desert, dotted with ancient [[Temple|temples]] and oasis gardens the size of jungles.
> In addition to Mahathallah herself, Voiporl is home to giant [[Serpent|serpents]] and dragonflies, as well as [[Witch|witches]], [[Medusa|medusas]], and [[Undead|undead]], all of whom eagerly prey on the damned [[Soul|souls]] who come to the desert caves after escaping from the forges of Phlegethon.
