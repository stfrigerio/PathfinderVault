> The **Paraheen** are an [[Ergaksen]] [[Dwarf|dwarf]] ethnic group native to [[Katheer]], the capital of [[Qadira]]. They work closely with the other communities of the city, but retain their own distinct culture. While relatively few in number, they are a respected part of Katheeri society. They typically live as businesspeople and smiths, and worship [[Sarenrae]] in an aspect tied to forge-fire.
