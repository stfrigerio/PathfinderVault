> **Night Plague** was a terrible [[Diseases of Golarion|disease]] that was used by the [[Usij]], [[Necromancy|necromantic]] followers of the [[Osirion|Osirian]] [[Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues]] in [[-3064 AR]] to wreak havoc among the royal houses of [[Jistka Imperium]]. The Usij captured a Jistkan [[Efreeti|efreeti]] commander and transformed him into a [[Ghul|ghul]]. They infected him with the terrible disease, which the enslaved efreeti traitor took back to his homeland. The deadly Night Plague specifically affected only the members of Jistka's royal houses. When the nobles were beset with the plague, it was a matter of time before their previous feuds re-emerged amid the chaos, leading to the downfall of the Jistka Imperium which collapsed three centuries later.
