> Referred to as the **Suq al-Azzmir Marketplace** by [[Efreet|efreet]], the **Great Bazaar** in the [[Plane of Fire|Plane of Fires]] [[City of Brass]] is one of the largest trading hubs in the [[Great Beyond]]. One can find almost any good imaginable here, from the mundane, like metals and spices, to the magical. The principal stock of this great market, however, is the [[Slavery|slave trade]] that flourishes here. Gold isn't the main currency that exchanges hands, that being instead magics that the efreet covet. The only items that are rare to see are anything related to water, which is strictly regulated, and items that could be used in the binding of [[Genie|genies]]. This region is among the most diverse of the whole city, consisting of many fire immune creatures like efreet, [[Azer|azers]], [[Salamander|salamanders]], and [[Fire elemental|fire elementals]].
