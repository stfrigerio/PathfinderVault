Orthost, at center.
> 
**Orthost**, also called the **Isle of the Dead**, is the smaller and more southerly island of the two main islands comprising the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of  [[Broken Bay]], the other island being [[Aegos]].
> The people of Broken Bay have traditionally buried their dead on this rocky isle if they are not so famous as to warrant a "hero's burial" at sea on a burning [[Ship|ship]]. Elaborate monuments and mausoleums, as well as simple stone cairns, lie on Orthost's northern edge. Most of the southern part of the isle remains a wasteland. The island is home to many uneasy [[Spirit|spirits]] and other dangerous [[Undead|undead]]. Regular rituals by [[Ulfen]] priests from [[Skjoldmur]] keep most of the spirits at rest, but no one willingly stays on the isle after dark.
