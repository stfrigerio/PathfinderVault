> **Metaphysics** is a [[Science|scientific]] branch of [[Philosophy|philosophy]] concerned with explaining the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it. On [[Golarion]], metaphysicists study [[Dimension|dimensions]], [[Plane|planes]], the [[Planar substrate|planar substrate]] that comprises reality, and [[Planar energy|planar energies]]; the passage of [[Soul|souls]] and nature of life, death, and [[Undead|undeath]]; and the nature of [[Deities|deities]], [[Magic|magic]], and [[Occultism|occult]] powers distinct from the practices of [[Divine magic|divine]], [[Arcane magic|arcane]], and [[Psychic magic|psychic magics]].

## Planar physics

> The [[Mortal|mortals]] of [[Golarion]] have several philosophies that attempt to describe the metaphysical relationships of the planes to each other. The most prominent is known as the [[Arcane tradition|arcane tradition]], also known as the orthodox scheme, which envisions the planes as nesting spheres of realities with the [[Inner Sphere]] at the center and [[Outer Sphere]] as the infinite exterior. In this model, the [[Positive Energy Plane|Positive]] and [[Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy]] planes govern the powers of creation and destruction in opposition to one another.
> An alternative philosophy, known as the [[Esoteric tradition|esoteric tradition]] or ancient wisdom, suggests that the Positive and Negative Energy Planes are instead complementary to each other, serving as the source and destination of all creation and forming a cycle that is [[Time|temporally]] and dimensionally infinite. All forms of life in this cycle are part of the [[Monad|monad]], a transcendental oneness that unites all souls into a single spiritual existence, with [[Aeon|aeons]] existing closest to the source of creation and mortal souls existing further away. This tradition minimizes the role of the Outer Sphere as well as the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental]] and Transitive planes.


## Essences

***Main articles: [[Planar essence]], Matter essence, Spirit essence, Mind essence, and Life essence***
> Planes are comprised of [[Planar essence|planar essences]], and scholars consider four fundamental types of essence that comprise reality: matter, spirit, mind, and life.


## Alignment

***Main article: [[Alignment]]***
> The concept of alignment is most directly applied in the metaphysical composition of [[Plane|planes]], and by extensions [[Outsider|outsiders]] and other creatures and manifestations strongly associated with aligned planes. A [[Soul|souls]] alignment heavily factors into its path on the [[River of Souls]] as part of its afterlife.
