> The **Grass-Shrouded Ziggurat** is an ancient [[Azlanti Empire|Azlanti]] ruin on [[Thoska Isle]] in the [[Ironbound Archipelago]]. Though many similar Azlanti ruins are sites of renown, the Grass-Shrouded Ziggurat has remained unbreached since before [[Earthfall]]. The millennia have covered and buried the seven-tiered ziggurat and now its unnatural shape is the only thing that hints at the mound's man-made origins.
> The Grass-Shrouded Ziggurat once served as the headquarters for a group of ancient Azlanti [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]]-priests known as [[Those Without Faces]]. This mysterious order of [[Arcane|arcane]] [[Astronomers|astronomers]] sought communication and congress with other worlds and their alien inhabitants. The winding halls and vast chambers of the ziggurat house priceless ancient [[Art|artworks]] made of [[Gold|gold]], [[Platinum|platinum]], and rare [[Gem|gems]], which are guarded by [[Brass golem|brass]], [[Clay golem|clay]], [[Iron golem|iron]], and [[Stone golem|stone golems]]. The greatest treasure is undoubtedly the *Great Telescope of Mandakarynia*. This incredible device is not only able to view any spot within [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Solar system|solar system]] but, using ancient incantations, is able to either [[Teleport|teleport]] the viewer to that location, or immediately [[Summon|summon]] those it spies upon. The telescope is still guarded by Mandakarynia, a powerful [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] [[Nosferatu|nosferatu]], as well as an ancient [[Demilich|demilich]], and a flight of [[Baykok|baykoks]].
