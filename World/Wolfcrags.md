> The **Wolfcrags** are the eastern foothills of the [[Tusk Mountains]], and are largely contained within the northwestern [[Frostmire]] region of the [[Worldwound]]. Their name comes from the inordinately large numbers of [[WolfSpecies of Wolf|dire wolves]] that haunted its twisting valleys before the opening of the portal to the [[Abyss]] in [[4606 AR]]. These wolves have long since perished and have risen as [[Undead|undead]] monstrosities that make their mournful, rasping howls at the [[Moon Golarion|moon]].


## Inhabitants

> In addition to the undead wolves, the Wolfcrags are also home to small bands of [[Troll|trolls]], [[Ettin|ettins]], and [[Hill giant|hill]], [[Frost giant|frost]], and [[Taiga giant|taiga giants]] who occasionally make their way out of the Tusk Mountains. Those who remain dwell in small caves and keep an eye out for roving [[Demon|demons]] from deeper in the Worldwound.
