> **Paupers' Graves** is a small graveyard three miles east of [[Sandpoint]] along the old [[Varisian]] *[[Varisian caravan routes|Kaspakari]]* (traditional coastal route along the [[Lost Coast]]). It was used as a graveyard by the poor of Sandpoint and the laborers from [[Magnimar]] who built the town. Usage dwindled once the [[Sandpoint Boneyard]] was opened to all regardless of ability to pay.
> Several years ago [[Jediah Kheln]] robbed the cemetery of its medallion of the [[Empyreal Lord]] [[Ashava]]. [[Kanker]], [[Ghoul|ghoul]] priest of [[Kabriri]], tricked Kheln into this theft. Kheln was repaid by Kanker with his death and transformation into a ghoul. Since then Kheln has turned the graveyard into his personal domain, building an underground warren for himself, his ghoul thralls, and his feral [[Ghoul hounds|ghoul hounds]].
> The warrens extend throughout the region, reaching under [[Devil's Platter|Devils Platter]] and even to the old smuggler's tunnels beneath [[Sandpoint]]. Kanker presides over an ancient temple to Kabriri somewhere in the tunnels.
