 A [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Asmodeus]] wielding a light mace.*See also [[CategoryImages of maces]].*
> A **mace** is a [[Weapon|weapon]] that combines a wooden or metal shaft, topped with an ornate metal or stone head. The head is sometimes flanged to cause more damage or pain. Primitive maces are often nothing more than a simple stone head attached with leather straps to a wooden shaft. Maces come in two varieties: **light** and **heavy**. The difference between them is that the heavy mace has a slightly longer shaft and a heavier head.
