> Despite its name, the tavern known as **The Friendly Merchant** is anything but. Located in the [[Shadow Magnimar district|Shadow]] of the vast [[Irespan]] in the [[Underbridge]] slum district, The Friendly Merchant is run by a [[Half-elf|half-elf]] named [[Siov Cassimeel]], who uses this ramshackle tavern as a front for petty crimes, but specialises in smuggling by using hidden docks attached to the tavern. Siov rents out the docks to anyone willing to pay his high prices, though he drops the price for any member of the [[Night Scales]]. He is also rumoured to keep track on anyone using his dock and reports them back to the Night Scale guild.
