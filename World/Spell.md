> A **spell** is a one-time [[Magic|magical]] effect brought into being, or "cast", by a [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]]. Spells, like the rest of magic, fall into one of three major types: [[Arcane|arcane]], [[Divine|divine]], and [[Psychic magic|psychic magic]].

## Casting spells

> Most spellcasters prepare their spells in advance—whether from a [[Spellbook|spellbook]] or through prayers—while some cast spells spontaneously without preparation. Despite these different ways characters use to learn or prepare their spells, when it comes to casting them, many of the spells are very much alike, with magic being guided by certain core principles. Some spellcasters select their spells from a limited list of spells known, while others have access to a wide variety of options.
> Spells can require considerable [[Concentration|concentration]] to cast, and often have a limited range. Some must be physically aimed, much like a [[Crossbow|crossbow]], at a target within the spellcaster's vision or affect an area or radius rather than a specific target. When cast, spells have distinct manifestations—whether visible or not—and people especially skilled in spellcraft can identify a spell simply by observing the spellcaster's actions.
> Many spells' effects can permanently affect a target, but few spells themselves are permanent once cast. Some can be made permanent through the application of the *permanency* spell, while spells whose effects last longer than an instant can be dispelled via the *dispel magic* spell or dismissed by their caster.


### Spell components

> Many spells require a **spell component** of some sort. Most arcane or divine spells require a material, somatic, or verbal component, while psychic spells instead require an emotional or thought component. Material components can be a consumed ingredient, or a reusable arcane or divine [[Focus|focus]].
> [[Valmallos]], the Answering Rite, is a [[Primordial inevitable|primordial inevitable]] who understands all laws of magic, and regulates its usage to ensure it is inaccessible to those who fail to put sufficient practice and training to wield it responsibly. Scholars believe the complex array of spell components so prevalent in magic are at least partially Valmallos's responsibility.


#### Material

> To cast a spell with **material spell components**, the spellcaster must be able to touch or hold a required ingredient or [[Focus|focus]]. Consumed material ingredients are often related to a spell's function; for instance, the *fly* spell requires a feather from an avian creature's wing. An arcane or divine focus is reusable, and a divine focus is typically in the form of a [[Deity|deitys]] holy symbol or a sacred natural plant.
> (Prepared) Spellcasters keep material components close at hand for easy access, often in a well organized, belt-bound pouch.


#### Somatic

> To cast a spell with **somatic spell components**, the spellcaster must be able to perform precise hand movements with at least one free hand.

#### Verbal

> To cast a spell with **verbal spell components**, the spellcaster must be able to speak an incantation in a strong voice. Spellcasters who are unable to hear are more likely to fail when casting spells with verbal components.


#### Emotional

> To cast a spell with **emotional spell components**, the spellcaster must be able to enter and control a specific emotional state. Emotional components replace somatic components in [[Psychic magic|psychic magic]].


#### Thought

> To cast a spell with **thought spell components**, the spellcaster must envision a specific mental construct. Thought components replace verbal components in [[Psychic magic|psychic magic]].


### Concentration

> Complex spells can take a considerable amount of time to cast and cannot be interrupted. Such spells require considerable concentration to cast and can be disrupted by physical or mental distractions. Vigorous motion, foul weather, combat, physical restraints, and injuries can all disrupt a spellcaster's concentration.


### Counterspells

> A spellcaster can **counterspell** another spellcaster's attempt to cast a spell, by casting the same spell at the same time in opposition. If the counterspeller is successful, neither spell's effects manifest.


### Effects of metamagic

***Main article: [[Metamagic]]***
> Spells can be empowered through the use of ancient techniques known as [[Metamagic|metamagic]].


## Magic items

***Main article: [[Magic item]]***
> Spells are closely tied to [[Magic item|magic items]]. Magic items require their creators to know certain spells, and some items—particularly [[Potion|potions]], [[Rod|rods]], [[Scroll|scrolls]], [[Staff|staves]], and [[Wand|wands]]—can store and be used to cast or reproduce spells and spell effects. Spells can also be [[Poisons of GolarionInfused poisons|infused with poisons]] through [[Potion|potionmaking]] techniques to combine debilitating effects.


## Alchemical extracts and formulae

*See also: [[Alchemy]]*
> [[Alchemist|Alchemists]] **extracts**, while magical, are not "spells" in the technical sense. They are material representations of a spell's effect and are crafted from **formulae** that resemble written spells.


## Magic-user and spellcaster

> **Magic-user** (sometimes spelled "magic user"), and **spellcaster**, are generic terms used to describe anyone capable of casting spells.
