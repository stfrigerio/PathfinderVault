> [[Ulfen]] traditionally keep **thralls**, [[Slavery|slaves]] who serve them for a set amount of time, after which they are set free. Thralls are generally captured in battle or condemned to their service after committing a crime by a special court known as a [[Thingmar|thingmar]]. No Ulfen, not even chiefs or jarls, are immune from this punishment given a serious-enough crime such as killing a child, betraying fellow warriors, or breaking an oath. Children born to thralls are always free, and thralls may file complaints against cruel or unfair treatment by their masters. This is generally done very cautiously, however, as it brings great shame to the master and often invites retribution.
