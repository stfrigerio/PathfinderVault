> The **Golemworks** is one of the most iconic industries in [[Magnimar]]; as its name implies, it produces [[Golem|golems]].



## Structure

> Located in the [[Bridgeward]] district near the northern section of the [[Irespan]], from the outside, the Golemworks look like a set of rather unremarkable warehouses. Inside the building artisans help create golems and simpler [[Construct|constructs]] using fallen blocks from the Irespan. Most of these blocks were dredged from the [[Varisian Gulf]] as, after the tragic events of [[4623 AR]], removing stone from the bridge itself has been banned.


## History

> Nearly thirty years ago, [[Toth Bhreacher]] discovered that the stones of the Irespan proved very useful in any sort of [[Magic|magic]] with the most obvious application in the creation of stone based constructs. Since then his operation has transformed from a small [[Wizard|wizards]] studio into a full blown industry.


## Training

> Wizards and those skilled in [[Alchemy|alchemy]] can become apprentices at the Golemworks. These chosen few specialize in [[Transmutation|transmutation]] or crafting skills, and some focus on general studies that aid in construction.


## Wares

> One of the more popular items manufactured for sale by the Golemworks is the [[Angelic guardian|angelic guardian]].


## Symbol

> The symbol for the Golemworks is a clenched fist, the back of which is embossed with a diagonally placed, crenellated tower and chisel.
