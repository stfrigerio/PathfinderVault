> The **Rasp** was a series of bluffs and cliffs that ran between the [[Fogscar Mountains]] and the [[Mushfens]] during the time of ancient [[Thassilon]]. This escarpment formed the natural border between the realms of [[Bakrakhan]] and [[Shalast]]. When the kingdoms were destroyed during [[Earthfall]], the westerly nation of Bakrakhan fell into the [[Varisian Gulf]], and the Rasp became what is known today as the [[Lost Coast]].
