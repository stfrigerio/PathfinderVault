> **Reanimations** is a store in the [[Ankar-Te]] [[Ring district]] of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]].  It is owned and run by [[Gerik Mubb]], and sells mindless [[Undead|undead]] to customers, who control them via [[Death's head talisman|deaths head talismans]].  The shop also sells [[Potion|potions]] and other [[Cleric|clerical]] services, which are generally of a higher standard than the undead.


## Competition

> The business is nowhere near as successful as its rival, [[Last Rites]], and caters mainly to less wealthy clients. Mubb resents the greater success of Last Rites, and it may be affecting his workâ€”some customers complain that his undead decay too quickly, and may include parts from more than one corpse.
