> The **Forest of Simarron** was once an idyllic area of the [[First World]]. It features in the [[Fey|fey]] fable of the [[Three sisters of Simarron]].
> The three sisters in the story became vain and bitter, and their inner corruption blighted the forest in which they lived. When the blight threatened to spread into other parts of the First World, the fey exiled the sisters to [[Golarion]] and razed the forest to the ground.
