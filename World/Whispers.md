> **The Whispers** is one of several neighbourhoods that comprise the residential district of [[Pauper's Palace|Paupers Palace]] in the sin-soaked city of [[Vyre]]. The Whispers provides some relief for the city's residents from the hustle, the bustle, and the sheer debauchery of [[Bliss]] and [[Vise|the Vise]]. The Whispers serve as Vyre's main slum alongside the much smaller [[Graveolent Gardens]]. Wedged against the sea in the south-eastern corner of the city, The Whispers is bordered by [[Nettles]] to the west and [[Old Vyre]] to the north.
