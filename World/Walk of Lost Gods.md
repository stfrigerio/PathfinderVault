> The **Walk of Lost Gods** are a series of weather-worn monoliths that surround the rise of the town of [[Gundrun]] in [[Sarkoria]]. They are monuments dedicated to old Gundrun's deities: [[Gorum]], [[Gozreh]], [[Pulura]], [[Torag]], [[Urgathoa]], Vard Rockgrinder (a fictitious local deity of the hills) and others. As settlers returned to Gundrun, they brought with them their gods as well. Today more than 100 carved logs, metal markers, and etched stones lean amid the ancient monoliths.
