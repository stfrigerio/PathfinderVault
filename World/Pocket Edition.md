A **Pocket Edition** is a smaller-format softcover edition of a [[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game]] or [[Pathfinder Adventure Path]] hardcover book. At 6.5 inches by 8.4 inches in size, Pocket Editions are about three-fifths the size of standard hardcover editions and generally retain the formatting and page number references of their full-sized editions.
