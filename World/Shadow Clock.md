> The **Shadow Clock** is a 250-foot tall clocktower in [[Magnimar]]'s [[Underbridge]] district. It is a rusting and leaning structure of stone, wood, and metal. Like the rest of Underbridge it is in constant shadow from the [[Irespan]]. An angelic statue sits atop the tower and the clock is frozen at 3 o'clock.
> At least 10 people have died trying to climb the inside stairs, which earned them the nickname "Terrible Stairs". While ordered closed by the city, this tower still stands.
> Local rumors say [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] or other nasty inhabitants reside in the tower. However, it is the current lair of the [[Scarecrow Magnimar|Scarecrow]], a [[Flesh golem|flesh golem]] made over 100 years ago by the [[Brothers of the Seven]].
