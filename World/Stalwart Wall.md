> Long ago, the archmage [[Nex (person)|Nex]] carried out his first experiments in [[Planar binding|planar binding]] and transformation in the interior of [[Valkus Isle]], just off the coast of [[Nex]]. They went dangerously awry, causing planar forces and monsters to be released on the people working there, and threatened the nearby city of [[Quantium]]. Nex and his senior apprentices engaged a failsafe known as the ***Stalwart Wall*** to contain these menaces, creating a [[Magic|magical]] wall around the island that none could escape. The barrier still exists today; anything can enter the island but nothing is able to return.
