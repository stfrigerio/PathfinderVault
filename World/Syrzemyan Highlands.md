> The **Syrzemyan Highlands** tower above [[Iobaria]], dominating the nation's central regions. Extensive caverns wind their way beneath the highland's many hills, cliffs, and mountains, and many of Iobaria's great rivers surge forth from the uplands. Despite plentiful riches, the highlands have remained largely uninhabited due to dangers such as marauding [[Ogre|ogres]] and bands of [[Cyclops|cyclopes]], [[Goblin|goblin]] hordes, and powerful [[Azorva]] [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaur]] tribes. The rugged settlers who do live in the Highlands are few and far between, maintaining well-defended "hutholds," though lone trappers, bounty hunters, and prospectors of all [[Humanoid|humanoid]] races can be encountered. Each village has their own individual names for the mountains, valleys, and regions of the Highlands.
