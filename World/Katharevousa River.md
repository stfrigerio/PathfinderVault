> The **Katharevousa River** is a tributary of the mighty [[Yolubilis River]] in northwestern [[Cheliax]] near the border with [[Nidal]]. It begins in the northern foothills of the [[Menador Mountains]] and travels in a roughly em-shaped line before meeting the Yolubilis a good distance south of the city of [[Kintargo]]. The river's steep banks have prevented any major settlement along its run, but fishermen take to its waters to avail themselves of the ample fish to be caught.
