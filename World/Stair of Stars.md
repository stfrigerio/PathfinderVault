> The Stair of Stars is a [[Constellation|constellation]] which astronomically points the way to the pole star, [[Cynosure]], and theologically points the way to [[Desna]]'s palace. 
Sometimes, this constellation is referred to as the **pointers**; these pointers are used by travellers at night to find Cynosure in order to calculate which way is north.
