> The **White Plague** was a series of murders and suicides in [[Westcrown]] instigated by the [[Path of Grace]], a cult of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Sifkesh]] that posed as [[Aroden|Arodenites]]. The killings began in [[4573 AR]] and continued until the month of [[Desnus]] in [[4577 AR]], when [[Daidian Ruel]] and his nascent [[Hellknights]] finished eradicating the cult from Westcrown by delivering the head of Attromia to [[Gaspodar|King Gaspodar]].
