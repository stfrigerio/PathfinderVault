> **Old Kintargo**, as the name suggests, is the oldest district of the city of [[Kintargo]] and one of its most eclectic, made up of a baffling mix of various industries, warehouses, and residential neighbourhoods. Most of the largest businesses have moved into other districts, other that the [[Metal|metalworking]] guild of [[Vespam Artisans]] and the [[Sallix Salt Works]]. Due to its age, many buildings have been destroyed and rebuilt, or buried multiple times. The actual living conditions of Old Kintargo tend to be fairly squalid, especially when compared with [[The Greens]] or [[Villegre]] districts. This is only worsened by a general unspoken agreement that the owner of any given building or patch of land is whoever currently uses it, resulting in shops like [[Odde 26 Daughter Herbs|Odde  Daughter Herbs]].
