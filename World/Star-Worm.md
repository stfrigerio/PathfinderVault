> The legends of the tribesmen of [[Casmaron]]'s central desert speak of the **Star-Worm**, a mighty monster that arrived from the stars, and gave birth to [[Golarion]]'s first [[Purple worm|purple worms]].
> The Star Worm is said to sleep in a mile wide valley formed by the impact of the meteorite that brought it to Golarion. One day it will awaken, and destroy the world.
> Several heroes of folk lore are described as confronting the beast, but none are credited with killing it. The Star-Worm is said to guard a great treasure, which might perhaps be able to somehow prevent the monster from destroying the world.
