> The ***Hao Jin Tapestry*** is an [[Artifact|artifact]] created centuries ago by the [[Tian]] [[Sorcerer|sorceress]] [[Hao Jin]]. It is the gateway to a [[Demiplane|demiplane]] of the same name, home to numerous different locations and environments.



## Geography

> The demiplane is accessible via the seemingly mundane wall hanging, the *Hao Jin Tapestry*, and is stocked by Hao Jin with people, monuments, and entire cities that she collected during her travels. Originally, each location Hao Jin created or placed in the tapestry had its own micro-climate, carefully controlled by Hao Jin's [[Magic|magic]]. However, recently, these climates have begun to shift and bleed into each other, developing its own strange weather pattern.


## History

> Hao Jin originally created the tapestry by ripping settlements (alongside their inhabitants) and geographical features from [[Golarion]] and transporting them fully intact to the demiplane to be preserved. She used it to hide her most dangerous treasures, and hid it away when she left the [[Material Plane]].
> In [[4711 AR]], the artifact was won by the [[Pathfinder Society]] in the [[Ruby Phoenix Tournament]] and brought back to the [[Grand Lodge]] in [[Absalom]] for further study.
> Although the preservation magic within the *Hao Jin Tapestry* has begun to fade, a lot of treasures remain intact and undiscovered. The Pathfinder Society has discovered how to create additional back doors to the Tapestry and opened up pathways that allow quick transportation between the Grand Lodge and many important [[Pathfinder lodge|Pathfinder lodges]]. These back doors require time to create and maintain, so the demiplane is no substitute for true [[Teleportation|teleportation]] magic. In any case, the artifact allowed the Society to extend its influence greatly.


## Inhabitants

> The *Hao Jin Tapestry* is home to numerous communities from across Golarion, like [[Dark stalker|dark stalkers]] from the [[Darklands]], [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] from [[Osirion]], the village of Onhae from the Chang Liao Jungle in [[Tian Xia]],, the Scalebreaker [[Kobold|kobolds]], among others.
