> The fabled **sun orchid elixir** is much sought after for its ability to temporarily halt the aging process, restoring the drinker to the age of its race's young adults. The secret of its creation was discovered by the [[Thuvia|Thuvian]] [[Alchemist|alchemist]] [[Artokus Kirran]] in [[1140 AR]].
> It is difficult and dangerous to make. The key ingredient is the nectar of the rare [[Sun orchid|sun orchid]] flower. The flower can be found only in Thuvia's desert interior, regions infested by the corrupted [[Genie|genies]] known as [[Div|divs]]. Orchid hunters must also contend with the local tribal leaders, known as [[Water Lord|Water Lords]]; many of these lords are little better than bandits.

## History

> By [[1141 AR]], a number of foreign nations were threatening to lay siege to Artokus's home city of [[Merab]] in order to control the scarce supply of the elixir. Merab turned to Thuvia's four other city states for aid, promising to share the proceeds of the elixir equally among them. The alliance was established in [[1142 AR]], and the [[Citadel of the Alchemist]] was constructed on the edge of the [[Barrier Wall]] in order to protect Artokus and his laboratories. Heeding the urgings of a priestess of [[Pharasma]] called [[Taladere]], the rulers of the city-states agreed to forego the benefits of the elixir for themselves and their people. Instead, they decreed that the only Thuvian allowed to take the elixir would be Artokus himself. The rest would be sold to foreigners.


## Distribution

> The supply of the elixir is rigorously controlled. Every year a blind, mute servant emerges from the Citadel with six vials. This is then transported to one of the five city-states for auction. Selected foreign emissaries are invited to the host city to bid for a vial. The six highest bidders each get a vial; the losers get nothing but still forfeit the amounts bid. However, the last two shipments have been lost due to apparent [[Teleportation|teleportation]] "accidents". This has damaged the young [[Guldis|Emir]] of [[Pashow|Pashows]] standing, and some would like to see him replaced as rulerâ€”perhaps by [[Ziralia]], daughter of the ambitious Prince [[Zinlo 1]] of [[Aspenthar]].
