> **Iron priests**, like [[Cleric|clerics]] and many other [[Divine|divine]] [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]], can channel divine energy. However, iron priests wield this power in ways that affect unliving [[Construct|constructs]], such as [[Robot|robots]] and [[Clockwork|clockwork]] creatures, instead of the [[Undead|undead]].


## Deities

> Most iron priests worship [[Brigh]], [[Nethys]], [[Gorum]], or [[Haagenti]].


## Abilities

> When iron priests channel [[Positive energy|positive energy]] into a construct, they effectively repair it, "healing" it as most other divine channelers [[Medicine|heal flesh]]. Likewise, iron priests who channel [[Negative energy|negative energy]] damage constructs. Iron priests can also spontaneously repair objects with [[Spell|spells]].
