> The **North Tack** is one of the two major sea trade routes through the [[Inner Sea]], the other being the [[South Tack]]. It is one of the oldest and most-profitable of the region's maritime trade routes. It runs along the Inner Sea's northern coast, beginning at the town of [[Sedeq]] in southern [[Qadira]], and ends in [[Corentyn]] in southwestern [[Cheliax]]. Along the way, it closely follows the coastline of [[Avistan]], except for north of [[Katheer]], where it tacks due west for [[Absalom]].
