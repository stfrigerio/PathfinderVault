> Approximately six centuries ago, [[Dwarves|dwarves]] constructed the ossuary of **Taal Mornat** especially for the servants of the [[Cathedral of Magrim]] in [[Larrad]] as well as other faithful servants of the [[Magrim|dwarven god]]. The necropolis lies some twenty miles west of the city in a hidden valley within the peaks of the [[Five Kings Mountains]]. Over time, due to the fame of many laid to rest there, the site is now a [[Holy|holy]] and cultural centre for the dwarven community.
