> **Kaladay** is a kingdom of [[Casmaron]], to the east of the [[Castrovin Sea]]. It is said to consist of arid plains and fabulous cities. It was settled by xenophobic colonists from [[Tian Xia]] and the realm is largely unvisited by people from the [[Inner Sea]], as the xenophobic inhabitants of its impressive cities ban all foreigners from entering. It is connected with the [[Karazh]] city of [[Ular Kel]] via a long trade route and sometimes rare and bizarre relics from Kaladay can be found within the markets of [[Sunrise Triangle]].


## Inhabitants

> Little is known of the people of Kaladay, other than that they are descended from [[Tian human ethnicity|Tian]] colonists who migrated there long ago. There is speculation that the [[Sweettalkers]], a group of mysterious inhabitants of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]], were originally from Kaladay, although none of its members has confirmed this.


## Explorers

> One visitor to the nation may have been [[Truan Iolavai]]. The *[[Record of Truan Iolavai]]* details his journey from [[Oppara]] in [[Taldor]] to the Kaladay province of [[Yen-Shuan]]. However, many historians doubt the accuracy of large parts of the *Record*.
