> **The Sordaiv** is unique amongst the tribes that serve the vicious carrion [[Ghartok|Carrion King]] for they are the only tribe that is not made up of [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]], the member of the Sordaiv are quite [[Human|human]]. The Sordaiv are an isolated, inbred tribe which has long been estranged from the nomads of central [[Katapesh]] who would have nothing to do with gnolls. According to their own legends at some point in the distant past the ancestors of the Sordaiv were greatly wronged by the tribes of central Katapesh and left thus explaining their presence in the inhospitable [[Brazen Peaks]] region. Now they have been reduced to consorting with gnolls, serving the Carrion King as desert trackers of notable skill.
