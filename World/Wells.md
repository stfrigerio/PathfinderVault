> The **Wells** are three large wells that supply water to the large town of [[Kibwe]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. The wells have been dug in the last two centuries and made the city far more defensible.
> The Wells are located in the Iwisa Block, [[Mozimba Camp]], and [[Walk of Shrines]] near the town walls, and their maintenance is funded by taxes levied against mining operations.
