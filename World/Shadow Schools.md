> The **Shadow Schools** are the mysterious training schools of the [[Lion Blades]] of [[Taldor]]. They are housed all over [[Oppara]]. Two are located in forgotten pockets of the sewer system, one beneath the [[Kitharodian Academy]], one beneath the [[Rhapsodic College]], one in an unused crypt beneath the [[Basilica of the Last Man]]. Three more are scattered under other parts of the city. Only the masters know the location of more than one of the schools, and only [[Dominicus Rell]] knows the location of all of them. The new recruits are trained for at least a year before taking on missions.
