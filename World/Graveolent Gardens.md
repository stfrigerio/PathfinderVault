> **Graveolent Gardens** was supposed to be a gift from the [[Vyre|Vyres]] nobility to its underclasses, a beautiful space for them to enjoy. Unfortunately, none of the nobles who built the park agreed to pay for its upkeep and now the Graveolent Gardens are a shantytown, worse even than the slums of [[Whispers]]. Here, the homeless of the City of Masks desperately battle for survival amongst the dilapidated statues, ancient trees, and the ruined remains of a once-magnificent park.
