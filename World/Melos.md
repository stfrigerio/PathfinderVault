> **Melos** is one of the [[Planet|planet]] [[Liavara|Liavaras]] five major [[Moon|moons]]. Evidence of life on Melos exists, but no one lives on the moon any more. Instead, there are only references to some exodus called the Taking.


## Geography

> Melos is a hospitable environment, with a breathable atmosphere and quiet seas.


## History

> According to [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence unearthed by scholars from [[Arkanen]], life on Melos vanished a millennium ago, leaving behind great stone ziggurats and temples, but not a corpse. Some mosaics speak of the Taking, a rapturous ascension gifted by the [[Deity|gods]] for devotion. Recently, within a temple, a carefully sealed, hidden alcove was discovered, scrawled with dire warnings that the Taking may not have been as glorious as it seemed.
