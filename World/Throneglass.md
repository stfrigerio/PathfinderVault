> ***Throneglass*** is a form of [[Magic|magically]] treated, green-tinted glass as strong as steel. All *throneglass* originates from a single massive sheet produced for the [[Azlant|Azlanti]] Imperial Palace in the [[City of Golden Gates]] as a skylight, a feature that became famous during the empire's height. A direct [[Meteor|meteor]] strike during [[Earthfall]] razed the structure to the ground and shattered the skylight; years later, the survivors recovered the surviving shards and used some to forge [[Weapon|weapons]].

> Most *throneglass* forged into new items is used to make melee weapons, though theoretically the material could be used for other purposes. Such weapons provide defenses against mental attacks and influences. If its wielder manages to resist such a power, the weapon stores the residual energy within itself. Anytime a weapon with such energy stored within itself harms a creature, it suffuses the victim with a disruptive field that interferes with their ability to use magic.
> The most proficient producers and wielders of *throneglass* weapons were the [[Knights of the Ioun Star]].
