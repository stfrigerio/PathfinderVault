> The **Sunwrought Festival** is held annually on the summer solstice, the longest day of the year.  It honors the goddess of the sun [[Sarenrae]], who is said to pay particular attention to her worshipers on this day.  The holiday is celebrated with dances, the giving of gifts, fireworks, paper streamers and kite flying.  Special markets in which people trade their finest goods are also a common occurrence, as are re-enactments of the battle between the Dawnflower and the god [[Rovagug]].  In these mystery plays, the role of Sarenrae is always played by a young maiden, while the Rough Beast is generally represented by a huge puppet made of wood, fabric and plastic.
