> The **Uwaga Highlands** are an area located in the north western [[Katapesh]], wedged against the snow capped [[Brazen Peaks]] the highlands are a wild buffer between the more civilised reaches of Katapesh and their northern neighbour [[Osirion]]. Uwaga is a wild place, a frontier land in a rich nation, while the laws of Katapesh still apply here the reach of the enigmatic [[Pactmasters]] rarely extends this far. The people of the Uwaga highlands are therefore used to solving there own problems and are an independent bunch. Between the area's few settlements the land is truly wild, roamed by feral wild life and savage humanoid tribes like [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] and [[Gargoyle|gargoyles]].
