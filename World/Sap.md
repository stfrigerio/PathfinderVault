> A **sap**, also called a **cosh** or **blackjack**, is a small but heavy type of [[Club|club]] often used to inflict nonlethal, incapacitating harm. It is typically made of a wide dense core, such as [[Lead|lead]], and wrapped in soft materials, such as leather. Its width and padding are meant to spread the force of a blow to reduce the chances that an assault with one will draw blood or break bones. As extremely simple [[Weapon|weapons]], saps are also often inexpensive.
