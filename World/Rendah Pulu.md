> **Rendah Pulu** are the southernmost islands of the [[Minata|Wandering Isles of Minata]]. This region has the worst reputation of all the islands, as most of the inhabitants are [[Demon|demon]]-worshippers who happily engage in acts of [[Cannibalism|cannibalism]] and other atrocities. These islands are so dangerous that they are even avoided by the [[Pirate|pirates]] who infest most of the rest of Minata. The islands of [[Lakapuna]] and [[Olakapuna]], which lie off the coast of the [[Valashmai Jungle]], are particularly infamous as they are home to cults of [[Evil|evil]] priests and vile [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]].
