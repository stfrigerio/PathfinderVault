> **[[Pathfinder First Edition]] content**
This article covers a class that is relevant to the [[Pathfinder campaign setting]] only in the context of the first edition of the [[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game]].


*This article is for a [[Core Rulebook First Edition]] class. For the 2e paladin (champion sub-class), see [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Champion]].*
> Where [[Fighter|fighters]] are the pinnacle of martial combat, the **paladin** blends martial skill with devotion to a righteous [[Deity|deity]], cause, or organization. The paladin is held to a much higher standard than members of any other profession, including [[Cleric|clerics]] and [[Monk|monks]]. If a paladin betrays these standards, they face spiritual penalty as well as the possibility of facing a penance, or even worse being removed from their order.



## Goals

> A paladin's primary goal is to convert the wickedâ€”the [[Evil|evil]] and [[Chaos|chaotic]] forces of the world and their servants. A paladin is bound both to do [[Good|good]] and to uphold just [[Law|law]], though if forced into a choice a paladin will likely choose the cause of good. They focus most of their efforts on evil [[Soul|souls]], and will attempt to convert before they resort to mortal combat.
> A paladin channels [[Divine magic|divine power]] and often has a patron deity, though one is not required. They are steadfast and determined, and like [[Monk|monks]] many maintain a life of routine and pure intent. They take good care of themselves physically and mentally, though they spend less time in meditation than monks. Paladins are also not concerned with physical perfection as much as spiritual focus.


## Regions

> Paladins are rare on [[Golarion]], even beyond the [[Inner Sea region]]. They maintain small enclaves similar to monasteries, or even as a part of a monastery. Of note is the [[Star Keep]] in [[Mendev]], where evil forces from the [[Worldwound]] pour forth in unending number but are held back by stalwart paladins. In [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] is the enclave of [[Vigil]], where [[Knight|knights]] of the Holy Citadel of Light learn the arts of war in preparation to battle [[Orc|orcs]] of the [[Hold of Belkzen|Belkzen]]. [[Andoran]] trains the [[Eagle Knights]], while [[Absalom]], [[Brevoy]], [[Osirion]], and [[Taldor]] all have small enclaves in addition to independent paladins throughout the world.


## Races

 A [[Gnome|gnome]] paladin.
> Becoming a paladin is a spiritual calling. Any creature capable of enlightened thought can be drawn to the ways of the holy warrior. Even the cruelest of savage [[Humanoid|humanoids]] might be gifted a vision or other awakening that leads them to the class. As paladins deal in repentance, so too do they accept into their order any creature that proves their dedication.


## Religions

> Paladins often do not worship a single deity, but rather abide by a strict personal code or organizational doctrine. Paladins who do venerate a single god, however, most commonly follow [[Iomedae]], the goddess of justice. Like [[Fighter|fighters]], paladins also might pay service to the deities of war or order.

## Fallen paladins

> If a paladin stops adhering to the causes of law and good, commits a heinously evil act, or otherwise violates their personal code of conduct, their divine gifts cease to function. A paladin who falls from grace can regain their divine power only by casting an *atonement* [[Spell|spell]], or more rarely by regaining the respect of their chosen cause. Very rarely, a paladin can shift entirely to the cause of evil and gain dark powers by becoming an [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Antipaladin|antipaladin]].
> Some paladins who stray from their path seek solace from [[Korada]], empyreal lord of forgiveness.
