> The **Vourinoi**, commonly known as **desert elves**, are an [[Elf|elven]] ethnicity who make their homes in the fertile river valleys or oases of [[Osirion]].


## Appearance

> Vourinoi can be identified by their dark brown skin and black hair, although individuals might have blue, green, or white hair.


## Culture

> Vourinoi are well aware of their home's inhospitality, and are gregarious and welcoming toward travellers and nomads who pass by their land, eagerly providing them shelter and water. They are taught to be charming and eloquent, and prefer peaceful resolutions to conflicts. Fiercely independent, they view themselves as separate from [[Human|human]] nations, and due to their skill at [[Magic|magic]] and warfare, the [[Pharaoh|pharaohs]] of Osirion have largely left them alone. Any who dare control or corrupt their oases quickly earn the ire of the Vourinoi.
> Most Vourinoi worship [[Desna]] and delight in travelling and meeting new faces, even by elven standards. They are particularly fond of visiting their [[Mualijae]] cousins in the [[Mwangi Expanse]], and vice versa. Many believe in the Brightness [[Philosophy|philosophy]], which posits that they will be reincarnated upon death.
