## Thileu bark

> **Thileu bark** is ground up and used as a hot [[Spice|spice]] for food. [[Cheliax|Chelish]] youths claim that snorting the powdered spice will give someone a [[Recreational drugs of Golarion|hallucinogenic reaction]], but it really only causes severe pain. If this powder is mixed with water, a paste can be created that causes skin irritation. [[Varisian|Varisians]] are the only ones who know how to cultivate the bark from a thileu tree without killing it. Unfortunately, bark can only be harvested once a year, so only about 50 pounds or so are exported each year, making it very expensive at 100 gp per pound. Some food and drinks that use thileu bark are the [[Alcoholic beverages|Thileu Lager]] sold by [[Jerikal Ashworth]] of [[Jerikal's Ales|Jerikals Ales]] in [[Katapesh]] and the Reefclaw pasty in [[Korvosa]].
