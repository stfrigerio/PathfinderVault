Please help [[httpspathfinderwikicomwindexphptitlePoisons of Golarionactionedit|improve it]] if you can; the [[TalkPoisons of Golarion|talk page]] might contain suggestions.This article has been tagged since **17:47, 8 September 2015 (UTC)**.


> **Poison**, **toxin**, or **venom** can quickly kill a fit and healthy person and, on [[Golarion]], poison is an omnipresent danger, be it naturally occurring in plants or venomous creatures, or the manufactured essence brewed by an expert in the hands of a trained [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|assassin]].
> Toxins can enter the body by ingestion, contact, inhalation, via a wound, or from the use of a [[Spell|spell]].
> Template:TOC



## Gods and poison

> The gods [[Norgorber]] and [[Ydersius]] claim poison as part of their portfolios, as do [[Demigod|demigods]] such as the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Jubilex]], the [[Daemon|daemonic]] [[Harbinger|harbinger]] [[Vorasha]], the [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp usher]] [[Teshallas]], and the [[Malebranche]] known as [[Scarmiglione]].


### Norgorber

> [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|Assassins]], [[Alchemist|alchemists]], and [[Herbalism|herbalists]], follow Norgorber as cultists who worship his guise as 'Blackfingers'.


### Ydersius

> Ydersius is sometimes called the 'Lord of Coiling Poison' and is famous for his threefold poison: fang venom, toxic blood and a cloud of poison exuded from his body.


### Jubilex

> Jubilex is the Demon Lord of Poison and Ooze and has many poisoners as followers.


### Scarmiglione

> The Malebranche known as Scarmiglione has Poison in his portfolio as well as Deceit and Temptation.


### Teshallas

> Teshallas, the Primordial Poison, is the psychopomp usher of poison and venomous creatures, but also acts as a patron of those who transform nature's poisons into [[Medicine|medicines]], such as alchemists and herbalists.


### Vorasha

> The daemonic harbinger Vorasha the Ophidian counts poison and toxicity as major elements of her portfolio.


## Creatures and poison

> Many creatures carry toxin administered in innumerable ways, such as through their bite, like venomous [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]]; from touching their skin, like some [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Frog|frogs]]; from a sting, like a bee's; from tentacles, like a [[Jellyfish|jellyfish]]; and from their breath, like some [[Dragon|dragons]]. Some of these creatures are bred for and milked of their venom, however, and these poisons are listed below under *[[List of poisons]]*.


## Using poison

![[Needler_Rogue.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Using poison on an arrow.
![[Poisoning_a_shuriken.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Reiko]] poisons a shuriken.
> As a group perhaps [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|assassins]] are the most famous users of poison, but many more people utilize its effectiveness, especially trained [[Inquisitor|inquisitors]]. Some [[Rogue|rogues]] also specialize in the poisoner's art.
> Special equipment may be purchased or fabricated to aid in poisoning an enemy, for instance the [[Blowgun|blowgun]] often used in the [[Mwangi Expanse]], [[Tian Xia]], and the jungles of [[Vudra]].
> **Blackfingers Paste** is another aid for poisoners, which was invented by the church of Norgorber. The poisoner applies it to his fingers before applying poison to a blade to prevent poisoning himself; the paste then leaves a tell-tale black stain for days afterwards.


## Creating poison

> Poisons can be extracted, distilled, or otherwise derived from many natural sources, including venomous creatures and poisonous plants. Several poisons listed below under *[[List of poisons]]* describe how and from what they are created.


### Arcanotoxins

> Alchemists who master poisonmaking can rapidly create and apply enhanced versions of existing poisons, which are known as **arcanotoxins**. Alchemists who specialize in arcanotoxins and poisons are known as **eldritch poisoners**.


### Magical poisons

> While [[Poisons acting from the use of a spell|certain spells]] can directly poison a creature, there are other ways [[Magic|magic]] can aid a poisoner.


#### Infused poisons

> Poisons can be infused through [[Potion|potioncraft]] to add a spell's effects to the poison's. An **infused poison** has a magical aura, and its spell takes affect after the poison starts to work. Infused poisons are noted as such in the list of [[Poisons acting from the use of a spell|poisons acting from the use of a spell]] below.


#### Necrotoxins

> Rare poisons invented in [[Geb's Rest]] (and also mastered in Daggermark) combine alchemy and [[Necromancy|necromancy]] to poison a victim's [[Soul|soul]] as well as its body. These **necrotoxins** often require reagents from [[Undead|undead]] creatures and the ability to channel [[Negative energy|negative energy]] into the brew. Necrotoxins are noted as such in the [[List of poisons|list of poisons]] below.


### Poison manufacturers and organizations

> Many people use poison, some more openly than others. That means there is a need to manufacture or collect poisons and there needs to be a market for trading in poison. Making poison is a skillful process and those untrained in the craft risk poisoning themselves. Trading in poison, depending on the region, may be open and public or the sole preserve of a black market.  Cities like [[Absalom]], [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]], [[Daggermark]] and [[Port Peril]] all have brisk and relatively open trade of poisons. 
> Poisons may be made by [[Expert|experts]] in that field, or by alchemists or herbalists.

> - In [[Daggermark]], the [[Daggermark Poisoners' Guild|Daggermark Poisoners Guild]] is a criminal organization dealing in poisons, and is closely associated with the [[Daggermark Assassins' Guild|Daggermark Assassins Guild]].
> - There is a Poison Makers' Guild in [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]], as well as the infamous [[Nightstalls]] where poison can be openly purchased.
> - In [[Sandpoint]], [[The Pillbug's Pantry|The Pillbugs Pantry]] has a discreet side line in poisons.
> - In [[Sothis]], [[Aqsarm]] plies his nefarious wares.

## Surviving poison

> Poison attacks the body quickly and to survive poison quick action is essential. There are a number of ways to combat poison:

> - Spells such as *delay poison*, *[[Heal|heal]]*, or *neutralize poison*
> - Ingesting a vial of antitoxin
> - A stout constitution, dwarves are particularly resistant to poison
> - A healer's care
> - Immunity to poison, for instance, like a powerful alchemist's, [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]]'s or [[Monk|monk]]'s innate ability or immunity granted through a spell like *heroes' feast*
> - A [[Paladin|paladin]]'s mercy

## List of poisons

> Below is a list of some of the poisons that can be found throughout Golarion, with an idea of the average cost of a dose of the poison. Some are found on every continent, while others are highly localized. It is by no means an exhaustive list.
