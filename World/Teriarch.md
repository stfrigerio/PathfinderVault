> **Teriarch** is title given to the unquestioned governor of the [[Absalom|Absalomian]] town of [[Diobel]]. The teriarch is appointed by the [[Grand Council of Absalom]], but once installed he cannot be removed. His office is in the [[Hall of the Teriarch]], which also holds the town's court. The teriarch's only rival for power in Diobel is the wealthy [[Kortos Consortium]], and the two constantly battle for control of the town. The current teriarch is [[Avid Arnsen|Scion Lord Avid]] of [[House Arnsen]], who was appointed by his former friend, [[Gyr of House Gixx]], Absalom's former [[Primarch|primarch]]. The primarch created the title of teriarch and gave Arnsen the position in repayment for years of loyal political support, but instead of seeing it as a reward, Arnsen saw it as a demotion and exile from the City at the Center of the World.
