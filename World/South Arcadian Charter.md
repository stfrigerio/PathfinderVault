> The **South Arcadian Charter** is a set of laws granting rights above and often outside the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] law to trading companies seeking to do business in [[Garund]]. The Chelish government offered them substantial financial subsidies and military protection. Essentially all chartered trading companies were granted the right to govern themselves, provided they paid marginal portions of their profits to the Chelish throne.
