> The **Siege of Prophets** was an attack on the city of [[Absalom]] mounted by the [[Prophet Kings]] in [[1298 AR]]. Although the [[Postern|Postern Gate]] of the eastern wall was breached, the forces of the city were able to keep the invading army from entering the city proper.  The exact location that marks the furthest advance of the invaders is still shown on the Gate, along with a commemorative stone which reads, "And No Further".  This has become the motto of the [[Post Guard]] which has its headquarters there. Absalom's government responded to their near-defeat by strengthening their defenses and building [[Starwatch Keep]] soon thereafter.
