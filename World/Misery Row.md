> **Misery Row** is a street running along the eastern edge of [[The Coins|the Coins]] district of [[Absalom]], and was until recently the only street in the entire city where the [[Slavery|slave trade]] was always legal. Slavery was abolished in Absalom following the events of the [[Fiendflesh Siege]] of [[4717 AR]].



## Description

> Misery Row is elevated from street level by a massive platform running its entire length, creating a wall that separates the Coins from the [[Merchants' Quarter|Merchants Quarter]]; access to the street can be gained via stairways located every few hundred feet. Although it is officially part of the Coins, no member of the [[Government of AbsalomDistrict Council|district council]] or [[CoinsDistrict Guard|Token Guard]] visited the street for political reasons while slavery was legal, although council members and the Captain received a kickback from every slave sale. Most slaves were held and sold from pits sunk into the elevated wall that is Misery Row itself, giving the street its nickname: the **"Slave Pits of Absalom"**.
> Since the abolition of slavery, Misery Row has become a run-down slum inhabited by some of Absalom's most desperate and depraved.


## Historic Slavery on Misery Row and Absalom Law

> Access to the slave market was restricted due to its elevation, but [[Lord Gyr]] prohibited using [[Magic|magic]] to harass the slave trade. He otherwise ignored mundane efforts to free slaves, as well as slaver reprisals on would-be liberators. The street was filled with both slave traders and buyers day and night, and the local guards generally did little to inhibit the coming and going of anyone who could reasonably be assumed to be doing business there.


## Merchants of Misery Row

> One of the best known slavers of Misery Row was a [[Vudrani]] man named [[Pardu Pildapush]] who owned Pildapush's Chattel.
