> **Idolisque** is the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Belial]]'s palace at the heart of [[Phlegethon]]. From the outside, it appears a paradise to the [[Soul|souls]] toiling in the dust. The most attractive souls are offered a choice, to spend eternity mining flakes of resources with their fingers or join the archdevil's harem. Once inside, these souls find only new and arguably worse horrors within the palace of the Pale Kiss.
