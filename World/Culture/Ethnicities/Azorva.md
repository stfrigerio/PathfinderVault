> The Azorva are an ethnicity of [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] who live in [[Iobaria]].
> One of the three main centaur ethnicities in the region, the Azora are the stockiest and hardiest of the centaurs. Aside from physical strength, they also have a darker skin and coat hue. They dwell almost exclusively in the rugged highlands and mountains of that land.
> It is known that the Azorva maintain winter homes in the [[Syrzemyan Highlands]] known as the [[Caverns of Pirthous]], where they wait out the worst of the elements or find refuge during war. Believed to be a tangle of tunnels and sheltered caves, no non-centaur have discovered any of these hidden places and lived to tell about it. They also reside in the peaks west of the [[Dvezda Marches]].
