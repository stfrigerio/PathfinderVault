> [[Asura|Asuras]] can grow mighty indeed in their endless cycle of reincarnation. The most powerful among them are the **asura ranas**, who dwell in ruined [[Holy|holy]] places, abandoned [[God|deific]] domains, or in the wilds of [[Hell]]. These potent [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]] have unique forms and are considered [[Demigod|demigods]] with the power to grant spells to their worshipers. They can demand anything of lesser members of their race, as they are revered as sages and profane bodhisattvas. They usually dwell in places that allow them to deny devotees of the deities access to holy objects or sites.
> [[Geryon]], now an [[Archdevil|archdevil]], was formerly an asura rana.
