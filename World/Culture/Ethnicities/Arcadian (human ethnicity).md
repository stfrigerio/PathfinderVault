> **Arcadian** is a generic name for the native [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Human|humans]] of [[Arcadia]], a massive continent that is home to hundreds of unique cultures and ethnicities.



## Groups

> Few of the many ethnic and cultural groups of Arcadia are known to visitors from the [[Inner Sea region]] (and fewer still in those travelers' homelands).


### Kansari

> The [[Ulfen]] settlers who were the first recorded [[Avistan|Avistani]] humans to encounter people on Arcadia gave them the derogatory nickname "**skraelings**", but the people were known in Arcadia as the **Kansari**. The Kansari were originally hostile to the colonists of [[Valenhall]], attacking with arrows and [[Tomahawk|tomahawks]], until unknown Ulfen diseases thinned their ranks. Today, the Kansari and nearby [[Mahwek]] live in uneasy balance with the Ulfen and other Avistani settlers.

### Mahwek

***Main article: [[Mahwek human ethnicity]]***
> The **Mahwek** people dominate northeastern Arcadia, and are the most populous and well-known Arcadian ethnicity to the continent's Avistani settlers. The nation of [[Degasi]] is mostly comprised of Mahwek, as are three other nations that join it in a trade coalition that protects and regulates the Avistani colonies.


### Calani

> Little is known of Arcadia's **Calani** people.


### Oeurfasians

> Little is known of Arcadia's **Oeurfasian** people.


## In the Inner Sea region

> Few Arcadians are known to have traveled to the Inner Sea region, though inhabitants of the Degasi city of [[Segada]] believe some might have secretly settled Avistani communities.
