> The bronze-skinned **Lirgeni** [[Human|humans]] (sometimes spelled **Lergeni**), now a diaspora after the [[Eye of Abendego]] destroyed their homeland of [[Lirgen]], are unique among their [[Mwangi]] and [[Garundi (human ethnicity)|Garundi]] neighbors. Many claim to be pure descendants of the original humans of [[Golarion]]. They are physically similar to the [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]], which would give credence to this unlikely claim.



## Appearance

> In modern terms, they could be described as being closest to the [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelaxian]], with a hint of [[Tian human ethnicity|Tian]]. They are typically tall, thin, and broad-shouldered, with dark, freckled bronze skin and light eyes. Many braid their dark, straight hair.


## History

*See also: [[Lirgen]]*
> While said to hail from some faraway land, the Lirgeni trace their recent origins to [[Rahadoum]], from which they migrated in [[2557 AR]] with the nation's [[Atheist|atheist]] proscription against religion. Their strength in the arts of [[Magic/Divination|divination]] and [[Astronomy|astronomy]] brought them wealth and power in their new home of Lirgen along the Gulf of Abendego, under the leadership of the oracular Saoc Bretheren.
> Indeed, the Lirgeni were so successful that one of their kind launched one of [[Golarion|Golarions]] only known space programs, sending a [[Spaceship|spaceship]] christened the *[[Lirgen's Glory|Lirgens Glory]]* off-world in [[4600 AR]].


### Eye of Abendego

*See also: [[Eye of Abendego]]Â and [[Lirgen]]*
> However, few Lirgeni remain in the area (now known as the [[Sodden Lands]]) because of the wrath of the [[Eye of Abendego]], which buffeted the nation in [[4606 AR]] after the death of [[Aroden]]. The people of Lirgen fled by [[Ship|ship]] from [[Hyrantam]] before the devastation of the Eye.


### In modern Garund

*See also: [[Jaha]]*
> Today, fewer than 5,000 Lergeni are thought to live in the Sodden Lands and follow their old ways of [[Lergeni astrology]], and no Inner Sea port has seen a Lirgeni ship since the Eye's appearance. The largest group of survivors re-located to [[Jaha]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]], apparently in response to an ancient prophecy. Some Saoc Brethren and their descendants returned to try to find some way to extinguish the Eye of Abendego, but all such efforts have failed.
