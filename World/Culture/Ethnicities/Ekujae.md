![[Ekujae_elf.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 An Ekujae elf.
> The **Ekujae** are a militant subgroup of [[Mualijae]] [[Elf|elves]] who dwell in the western [[Mwangi Expanse]].



## Government

> The Ekujae are a united nation consisting of numerous clans, who maintain strong relationships but are so self-sufficient that many outsiders mistakenly believe that they are entirely separate from each other. Clan leaders and advisers are chosen democratically, with all adults allowed to vote; in contentious elections, the new leader might have to prove their worth by fulfilling a task demanded by the people. The clan leaders elect a king or queen among themselves, but this position only takes charge when a central authority is needed in times of emergency.


## History

> When [[Earthfall]] was imminent, the Ekujae chose to remain on [[Golarion]], despite the incoming calamity, instead of returning to [[Sovyrian]] with the rest of their race. In the wake of Earthfall, they came into conflict with a [[Manifestation|manifestation]] of [[Dahak]], who saw the chance to wreak havoc in Golarion without drawing the attention of his father and archenemy [[Apsu]]. Many Ekujae heroes gave their lives to bolster the strength of their comrades and to allow them to defeat Dahak. The Ekujae spilled Dahak's blood across their lands and broke a horn and two fangs from his head, before driving his manifestation into one of the *[[Elf gate|aiudara]]* that makes up [[Alseta's Ring|Alsetas Ring]], trapping him in a space between realities. Ekujae consider this battle their greatest victory and defeat: they managed to defeat a living aspect of a [[Deity|deity]], something which many others would never attempt, and yet they failed to finish off their enemy.


### Recent history

> In [[4708 AR]], angered by how the [[Aspis Consortium]] employed Ekujae as [[Slavery|slave labour]], they massacred the personnel at [[Whitebridge Station]] and laid siege to [[Nightfall Station]].


## People

![[Fola_Barun.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Fola Barun]], Ekujae half-elf [[Shaman|shaman]] and [[Pathfinder]].
> Ekujae have the jet-black eyes of elves and the black hair and dark brown skin of their [[Mwangi]] [[Human|human]] neighbours. On average, they are more muscular than other elves but still lanky by human standards. Ekujae traditionally adorn themselves with white paint, which represents the individual's most essential aspects: family, clan, personal history, accomplishments, profession, or even mood. Those who change their symbols too frequently are considered flighty.
> Ekujae often wear green and brown clothing, which make for practical jungle camouflage. They usually make their clothing from wood, leaves, leather, fur, and bone, and enhance their quality through the use of woodwarping [[Magic|magic]].
> Ekujae view it as their sacred duty to train and prepare for Dahak's return to honour their ancestors' sacrifice, but also out of their pride as hunters who have injured a beast and are duty-bound to deal the killing blow.
> Ekujae invented a method of using the fangs of [[Sevencoat serpent|sevencoat serpents]] as unique [[Tattoo pen|tattoo pens]] to replace a more mundane quill.


### Religion

> [[Yuelral]] is the Ekujae nation's patron deity, and they believe that their role as guardians and scholars pays homage to her. They also worship the rest of the [[Elven pantheon|elven pantheon]]: [[Ketephys]], [[Findeladlara]], [[Desna]], and [[Calistria]]. Worship of other deities is also frequent, as Ekujae believe that it is common for a deity to task a follower to worship them and enact their agenda.


## Ekujae half-elves
