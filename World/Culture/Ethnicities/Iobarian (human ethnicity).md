 An Iobarian woman.
> The **Iobarian** peoples are a [[Human|human]] ethnicity originating from northwestern [[Casmaron]] and northeastern [[Avistan]], specifically the nations of [[Brevoy]], [[Mendev]], and the ruins of [[Iobaria]]. Descended from [[Ulfen]] explorers, Iobarians are seen by many in [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]] as humans from Casmaron who are neither [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]] nor [[Casmar human ethnicity|Casmar]]. Those who claim to be "true Iobarians" are typically those who follow the fractious leaders of Iobaria's ruined cities and believe in a still-unified realm. Others, perhaps up to eighty percent of Iobaria's population, instead live in small hamlets and claim no allegiance beyond their blood, tending towards isolation out of fear of resurgent [[Diseases of Golarion|plagues]], a spirit of independence, and a desire not to swear allegiance to unworthy nobles.
> Iobarians share their lands with many monstrous creatures, and use two terms found in no other language to classify other beings: "kodlak" and "kodlok". Kodlak refers to [[Humanoid|humanoids]] who assume [[Animal|animal]] forms, like [[Lycanthrope|lycanthropes]], while kodlok is used to describe creatures with innate animal traits, like [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] and [[Harpy|harpies]]. Only Iobarian humans make this distinction, and being a kodlak or kodlock could be a path to power or a death sentence, depending on the location and faith of the Iobarian.
