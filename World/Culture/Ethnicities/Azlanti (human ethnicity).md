 [[Aroden]], the last Azlanti.
*This article is about the now-extinct [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Human|human]] ethnicity. For the language of the Azlanti, see [[Dead languages of GolarionAzlanti Ancient Azlanti|Azlanti]].*
> The **Azlanti** are now little more than a memory: an ancient, near mythical progenitor of all [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Human|human]] civilization native to the lost empire of [[Azlant]]. The last true, pure-blooded Azlanti was one of the most famous humans of all time: the [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]]. He dragged the [[Starstone]] from the depths of the [[Inner Sea]] at the beginning of the [[Age of Enthronement]], and later became the patron deity of the greatest human empires in the [[Inner Sea region]]: [[Taldor]] and [[Cheliax]].



## Appearance

> The ancient Azlanti were, according to contemporary accounts, a regal and aloof people with noble features and haughty attitudes. They had dark hair, ranging in color from dark red to brown and black, and their skin tones ranged from olive to pale white. They were also known for having prominent brows and high hairlines; this was especially true for the men, whose hair would often recede into a widow's peak. One of the most well-known Azlanti physical attributes were their purple-colored eyes, a trait which still crops up in other peoples from time to time, and which is always a sign of Azlanti heritage.


## History

> The Azlanti are believed to have been [[Golarion|Golarions]] first advanced human civilization. The ancient empire of Azlant, from which the Azlanti gain their name, covered all of the continent in the middle of the [[Arcadian Ocean]]. The rise of Azlanti culture was brought about by the interference of the [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]], an even older race of aquatic creatures fond of genetic manipulation. They took the early cave-dwelling and nomadic humans of Azlant and set them on the path to a complex, centralized, and agrarian civilization.
> The Azlanti culture flourished for thousands of years, but eventually began to believe themselves as superior to their [[Alghollthu master|alghollthu masters]]. In payment for their disloyalty, the alghollthus drew down a massive [[Meteorite|meteorite]] to destroy their intellectual progeny. The resulting apocalypse became known as [[Earthfall]]; it destroyed Azlant, killed most Azlanti, and sunk the entire continent to the bottom of the ocean.
> Some of the survivors sought refuge along the coast of the newly formed [[Inner Sea]], eventually helping to found the nation of [[Taldor]]. The history of the Azlanti may be lost to time and the Arcadian Ocean, but their cultural influences can be seen in many of the [[Inner Sea region]]'s current civilizations.


### On distant worlds

> Early Azlanti ambitions for the stars resulted in the formation of the [[Moonscar]] on Golarion's [[Moon|moon]] more than 12,000 years ago, as part of a failed magical terraforming experiment that ripped a tear in the [[Plane|planes]] and allowed [[PathfinderWiki/Manuals/Demon|demons]] of the [[Abyss]] to infest the moon.
> Other Azlanti appeared on [[Akiton]] through a [[Portal|portal]] to [[Arl]]. These Azlanti subjugated the Free Peoples of the High Plateau, and to this day the people of Arl speak an accented form of [[Azlanti language|Azlanti]] and consider their city part of the Azlanti empire.


## Culture

 Jazrada, the [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghostly]] remains of an Azlanti [[Arcanist|arcanist]].
> Due to the devastation caused by Earthfall, little is known of ancient Azlanti culture. Both [[Taldan human ethnicity|Taldans]] and [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelaxians]] aspire to be their heirs, both in blood and spirit. Many stylistic elements of their culture are still copied to this day. A newly discovered piece of authentic Azlanti jewelry or architecture can trigger a design trend followed throughout the Inner Sea region.


### Language

> The Azlanti people spoke a language also known as [[Dead languages of GolarionAzlanti Ancient Azlanti|Azlanti]] or Ancient Azlanti. Even though it hasn't been actively spoken for millennia, its linguistic legacy is carried on in such languages as [[Human languages of GolarionCommon Taldane|Taldane]], [[Human languages of GolarionPolyglot|Polyglot]], [[Human languages of GolarionHallit|Hallit]], and [[Human languages of GolarionVarisian|Varisian]].


### Naming conventions

> Another popular way in which people of today adopt Azlanti culture, is by giving themselves or their children the archaic names found on artifacts, wall mosaics, or manuscripts. Azlanti names almost always begin with a vowel, and never include a surname. Popular males names include Akorian, Olhas, and Ureste, while females are called Iaome, Ommarra, or Ulionestria.


### Dress

> Little or no actual clothing from Azlant has survived the millennia, but depictions of Azlanti dress can sometimes be found painted on ancient walls or artifacts. These depictions show that deep green and crimson were popular colors among the nobility, a palate which is often followed by those wishing to be perceived as having strong Azlanti heritage.


### Slavery

***Main article: [[Slavery]]***
> The ownership of sentient humanoid creatures is known to have been a common practice among the Azlanti. Many people who claim Azlanti ancestors therefore see slavery as their natural birthright. This is not the case in [[Andoran]], where the practice is considered anathema to the country's democratic and egalitarian values, despite the fact that Azlanti culture and design are otherwise still a prominent pat of Andoran culture.


### Religion

> The Azlanti worshiped, among others, the following deities:

> - [[Abadar]], as a god of cities and wealth rather than law
> - [[Acavna]], a goddess of battle and the moon who died prior to [[Earthfall]]
> - [[Achaekek]], god of monsters and natural disasters (unlike his modern role as god of assassination)
> - [[Amaznen]], main god of magic, outlawed in [[Thassilon]], presumed killed during [[Earthfall]]
> - [[Curchanus]], god of travel, beasts, and endurance, survived [[Earthfall]] but killed by [[Lamashtu]]
> - [[Desna]], seen as goddess of the stars
> - [[Groetus]], apparently a late addition to the pantheon
> - [[Nurgal]], his worship suffered during the [[Age of Darkness]]
> - [[Pharasma]], seen as the patron of prophecies, she paid the price for being the bearer of bad news
> - [[Shelyn]] patron of the arts
> - [[Zura]], not worshipped openly

## Azlanti descendants

> Several other species are said to be descended from the Azlanti, although this connection cannot be known for sure.

> - [[Gillman|Gillmen]]: Also known as the Low Azlanti, these amphibious creatures long ago took to living below the sea. They maintain a connection to the surface world through their presence on the [[Isle of Kortos]], especially in [[Escadar]] and the neighborhood of [[Gilltown]] in [[Absalom]]. They are said to have the best claim for being the true sons and daughters of Old Azlant.
> - [[Dark folk]]: Descendants of Azlanti who fled the destruction of [[Earthfall]] and descended into the [[Darklands]], they can be divided into two related species, the [[Dark stalker|dark stalkers]] and the [[Dark creeper|dark creepers]].
> - [[Mongrelman]]: These degenerate descendants live in the Darklands realm of [[Nar-Voth]].
> - [[Morlock]]: In an insane drive to maintain racial purity, these Azlanti descendants eventually devolved into the bestial morlocks. They now dwell primarily in the Darklands realm of [[Sekamina]].
> - [[Munavri]]: Many of the sea-borne ships and vessels that survived the initial destruction of the Earthfall were taken by the alghollthus through the subterranean water column known as the [[Braid]], and from there into the [[Sightless Sea]] of [[Orv]]. These Azlanti managed to avoid the degeneration that claimed their fellow survivors in shallower parts of the Darklands and evolved into the albino, telepathic Munavri race.
> - Some [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelaxians]] and [[Taldan|Taldans]] carry small amounts of Azlanti blood in them, giving rise to certain typical Azlanti physical traits such as violet eyes or widow's peaks. Such characteristics are generally highly sought-after.

### Azlanti today

> Even though the Azlanti as a pure-blooded ethnicity are long extinct, there exists a very small possibility that a true-blooded member of that ancient line still exists today, perhaps in a powerful magical sleep, or as part of a very secret and distant community of their kind.
