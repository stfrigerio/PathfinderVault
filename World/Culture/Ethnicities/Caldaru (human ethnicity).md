> The **Caldaru** people are an [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] ethnic group who make up a minority population in [[Xopatl]]. An immigrant Caldaru population can be found in the city of [[Senghor]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]; many years after making their home in the Mwangi Expanse, they only recall that their ancestors came from a distant land and have lost contact with Arcadia but retain their unique culture and language, distinctive from those of the [[Mwangi]] peoples who make up a majority of the Expanse's population.
> In appearance, they are tall, with dark tan or olive skin, straight dark hair, and green or blue eyes. This makes them somewhat similar in appearance to the [[Lirgeni human ethnicity|Lirgeni]] who once lived in the northern part of what is now the [[Sodden Lands]].
> They are renowned sailors and diplomats, making Senghor a popular place for trade, and skilled engineers who have built the city to withstand powerful storms. The city's Caldaru-dominated navy also expertly defends the city from [[Pirate|pirates]]. This combination of traits lends credence to theories that the Caldaru originated from a lost seafaring power.
