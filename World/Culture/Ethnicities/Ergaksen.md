 A Pahmet dwarf, an Ergaksen.
> The **Ergaksen**, or **surface dwarves**, are one of the main subsets of the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] race alongside the [[Grondaksen]] and [[Holtaksen]].
> Surface dwarves descend from those dwarves who scattered throughout the world after the [[Quest for Sky]], mingling with its peoples and forming their own distinct cultures. While Grondaksen and Holtaksen dwarves consider the Ergaksen to be a single group, the surface dwarves themselves do not, and only use the Ergaksen appellation when dealing with their cavern- or mountain-dwelling cousins. They are not themselves united by any shared cultural ties, but simply by their differences from the other dwarven kins. Numerous notable Ergaksen cultures exist, including the [[Pahmet]] of [[Osirion]], the mercantile [[Paraheen]] of [[Qadira]], the [[Dragon|dragon]]-worshipping [[Mbe'ke|Mbeke]] and [[Taralu]] of the [[Mwangi Expanse]], and the monastic and [[Atheist|atheist]] [[Vahird]] of the [[Eternal Oasis]] of [[Rahadoum]].
