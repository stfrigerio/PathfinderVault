 The Cosmic Caravan is used by astrologers to predict the future.
> Practitioners of the divinatory art of **augury** attempt to derive knowledge of future events from natural circumstances in the present. Forms of augury include [[Astrology|astrology]] and the [[Divine magic|divine magic]] [[Spell|spell]] of the same name. Augury, like all forms of prediction in the [[Age of Lost Omens]], is fallible.
> Followers of certain [[Deity|gods]], such as [[Desna]], are sometimes able to enhance their augury through [[Divine|divine]] intervention. Certain [[Magic item|magic items]], such as the *idol of the eye* and [[Pharasma|Pharasmin]] *spiral tiles*, can enhance feats of augury.
