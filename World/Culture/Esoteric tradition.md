> The **esoteric tradition**, also known as **ancient wisdom**, is an [[Occult|occult]] [[Metaphysical|metaphysical]] [[Philosophy|philosophy]] that believes a complete understanding of a hidden truth in the [[Multiverse|multiverses]] makeup, and in particular the role of the [[Energy plane|energy planes]], can grant a person the ability to guide their own reincarnation after death.


## Concepts

> The esoteric tradition believes the multiverse is driven only by [[Positive energy|positive]] and [[Negative energy|negative energy]], not in opposition but rather integrated with one another and with all other forms of energy derived from those two sources. This focus on the [[Inner Sphere]] de-emphasizes the role of the [[Outer Sphere]] and [[Astral Plane]] in relation to the mainstream [[Arcane tradition|arcane tradition]].
> This unified cycle of creation and destruction is metaphorically described as the exhalation and inhalation of one universal breath, and the esoteric tradition believes all multiversal life is unified by a single transcendental undersoul known as the [[Monad|monad]], or "condition of all." In this model, life is segmented by distance from the Cosmic Fire of the Positive Energy plane, with [[Aeon|aeons]] closest to its center and [[Mortal|mortals]] much further away. The Negative Energy Plane's entropic powers are considered vital to the multiverse's own growth toward perfection, instead of an antagonistic evil void of mindless destruction.


## Practitioners

> Practitioners believe that a complete understanding of the esoteric tradition grants them control over their own destiny, including the cycle of reincarnation. This allows them to pursue perfection of body, mind, and [[Soul|soul]], as well as immortality and expanded consciousness.
