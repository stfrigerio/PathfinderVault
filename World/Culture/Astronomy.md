> **Astronomy** is the study of the skies and the [[Celestial body|celestial bodies]] therein. It is one of the oldest [[Science|sciences]] on [[Golarion]], with evidence of interest in astronomy being found in ancient civilizations. **Astronomers** study the [[Solar system|solar system]] and its contents: the [[Sun]], the [[Planet|planets]] and their [[Moon|moons]], the [[Diaspora]] and [[Comet|comets]]. Beyond the solar system in which Golarion orbits, astronomers also study the [[Star|stars]] within their [[Constellation|constellations]], the [[Dark Tapestry]] between the stars, and all other elements within the firmament of the [[Material Plane]].
> Astronomy is taught at a number of establishments on Golarion, and there are also many [[Observatory|observatories]] around the world used to practice astronomy. Astronomy is also important within many faiths, particularly among followers of [[Desna]]. It is also employed by navigators on [[Ship|ships]], who can gain their bearings by the stars' visible position relative to their own.
