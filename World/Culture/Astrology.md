## On Golarion

> Among more structured [[Arcane|arcanists]] and scientists, the interpretive nature of astrology—and lack of causal evidence of any meaningful relationship between the cosmos and [[Mortal|mortal]] beings—leads it to being viewed as unreliable and disreputable. Nonetheless, the record of connections between astrological events and history leads to astrology being a better-funded science than the more evidential study of [[Astronomy|astronomy]].
> Astrology is used for [[PathfinderWiki/Culture/Augury|augury]] as well as to determine a person's personality based on their birth date and location.


## Zodiacs

### Dragon Empires zodiac
