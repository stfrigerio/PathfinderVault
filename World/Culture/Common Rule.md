> **Common Rule** is a philosophy based on the concept that all are inherently equal in importance, and that no individual has the right to force his or her own beliefs upon another. This point of view stands in stark contrast to the practices of [[Slavery|slavery]] and servitude, and supports a governing body granted power directly by the people it leads.
> The nation of [[Andoran]] established Common Rule in [[4669 AR]], following its secession from the empire of [[Cheliax]] in what is known as the [[People's Revolt|Peoples Revolt]]. The ruling nobility was removed from power, the nation's prisons were emptied, and its slaves granted freedom. The people of Andoran continue to follow the ideals of Common Rule to this day, both within its borders and beyond.
