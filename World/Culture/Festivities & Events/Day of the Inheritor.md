 Iomedae's holy symbol.
> On the 19th of [[Rova]] is the **Day of the Inheritor**. It celebrates the welcoming of [[Aroden]]'s faithful into the flock of [[Iomedae]] after the death of [[Aroden]]. It is a day of solemnity and brotherhood, of thanks to allies and goddess Iomedae, a day for forgiving grudges, and a day for prayers to the fallen. The churches hold a service and a moment of silence marks the day on fields of battle and in sport events.
> It seems likely that this holiday will eventually fade away and be forgotten.
