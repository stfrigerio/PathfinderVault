> A **Convocation of Dragons** is an extremely rare event in which members of all species of dragonkind are called to an isolated location (generally a small island off the western coast of [[Garund]]) in order to discuss topics of pan-draconic importance.  These Convocations can only be called by important [[Gold dragon|gold dragons]], and they are attended by representatives of every major species, including the selfish and argumentative chromatic dragons.  The only absentees are the aggressively anti-social [[Black dragon|black dragons]], who refuse to attend.
> These meetings are always heated and combative affairs, as the chromatic and metallic dragons generally have a hard time agreeing with each other on anything.  Most only last a few days, and many end in bloodshed, although a few have elicited subtle shifts in pan-draconic behavior and policy.
> The last Convocation was called by the gold dragon [[Aostralya]] in [[4607 AR]] in order to discuss what impact the death of the [[Human|human]] god [[Aroden]] would have on their kind.  The chromatics took the predictable position that human affairs were below their consideration, and refused to agree on anything.  The only topic that elicited any kind of bipartisan support was the perennial effort to hunt down and kill the draconic god [[Dahak]]; and the only chromatic dragon to agree with the metallics on this, was the [[Red dragon|red dragon]] [[Grathalax]].
> These meetings are exceedingly rare, only happening once or twice a century.  Past Convocations have dealt with such topics as the eradication of Dahak, concern over what to do with the immensely powerful red dragon [[Daralathyxl]], the return of the [[Elf|elves]], and the meaning and repercussions of [[Earthfall]].
