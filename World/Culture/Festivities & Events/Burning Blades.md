> **Burning Blades** is a religious holiday held annually on 10 [[Sarenith]].  It is celebrated in honor of the goddess of light [[Sarenrae]] and is actually the culmination of a month-long summer festival held in her honor.  Burning Blades focuses on the sun and the goddess' powers of healing.  It gets its name from the dance of the burning blades, in which worshipers dip ceremonial weapons in pitch or another flammable substance, and dance with the burning brands in hand.  Legends recount that if one of Sarenrae's faithful is in mortal danger on this festival day, his or her weapon will burn with a holy fire.  This has proven to actually be true so many times throughout history, that those with bad intentions generally avoid the Dawnflower's faithful on this day.
