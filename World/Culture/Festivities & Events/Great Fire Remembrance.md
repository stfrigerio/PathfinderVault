> **Great Fire Remembrance** is a [[Holidays and festivals|holiday]] celebrated on each 13 [[Neth]] in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]]. It commemorates the [[Great Fire]] of [[4429 AR]], which devastated the then still fledgling [[Cheliax|Chelish]] colony of [[Fort Korvosa]]. On this somber day, most of the city shuts down and people generally remain at home. It has become tradition not to light any fires (not even cooking fires) on Great Fire Remembrance.
