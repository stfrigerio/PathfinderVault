> Observed on 14 of Neth, Even-Tongued Day was once a day of joy and celebration in [[Cheliax]], but has become instead one of mourning.
> Originally, the date marked the conquest of [[Aspex the Even-Tongued]], who brought the nations of [[Galt]], [[Andoran]] and [[Isger]] under Chelish control. Since the death of [[Aroden]] and the loss of these nations, the holiday instead marks the loss of territory and glory once held by Cheliax. Oaths are sometimes made, typically to [[Asmodeus]], and rarely of a pleasant nature (such as the reclaiming of the lost empire and vengeance against treacherous former allies).
> Citizens wear black on this day, public speaking is forbidden, and old feuds and vendettas are rekindled.

> The Church of Milani still celebrates Even-Tongued Day as it is a holiday, they see, associated with freedom from an oppressive empire: [[Taldor]].
