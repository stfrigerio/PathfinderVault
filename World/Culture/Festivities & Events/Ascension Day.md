> Much like the [[Deity|god]] to whom it is dedicated, the [[Caydenite]] [[Holiday|holiday]] of **Ascension Day** is generally celebrated in a very informal style. Occurring annually on 11 [[Kuthona]], it commemorates the day Cayden Cailean passed the [[Test of the Starstone]] and [[Ascension|ascended]] to [[God|godhood]] in [['65 AR]]. In all likelihood, the 11th of Kuthona is not the exact date on which it actually happened, but since the god was dead drunk when it happened, it will probably be never known.


## Celebration

> Celebrating Ascension Day generally involves toasting one another with a hot [[Alcoholic beverages|alcoholic beverage]], thanking the Drunken Hero for what he has provided, and eating plenty of sweet pastries.
