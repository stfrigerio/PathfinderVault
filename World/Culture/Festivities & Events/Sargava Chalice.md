> The **Sargava Chalice** is a famous race run annually in [[Sargava]] since [[4681 AR]]. 
> It is the foremost of a number of events organised by the Sargavan government in order to raise revenue and improve the morale of its citizens.
> The race is run over several days through the harsh terrain of the Sargavan interior. Competitors are expected to run through dense jungle and rugged mountains, and not all of them survive the experience. In the past they have included [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]], [[Adventurer|adventurers]], and even a deposed monarch.
> The winner's name is inscribed upon the golden chalice from which the race gets its name.
