![[Drow_slaves.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Drow]] are among the many races and cultures in [[Golarion]] that practice slavery.
> **Slavery**, the system of owning and selling other sentient races, is the foundation of many of the [[Inner Sea region|Inner Sea regions]] agrarian societies, but condemned or limited in others. What follows is a brief overview of how the various countries, cultures, and races of the region feel about the act of owning, buying, taking, and selling of slaves.



## Definitions

> Even though slavery is tolerated throughout much of the Inner Sea region, it is not universally applied. For instance, slaves are almost always taken from the lower classes, and the stealing of members of the nobility and selling them into bondage is universally seen as abhorrent and criminal.


## Slaver nations of the Inner Sea region

> - [[Cheliax]]: As befits a nation devoted to the god of tyranny, slavery is heavily promoted by the government, and slaves are drawn particularly from the [[Halfling|halfling]] and [[Tiefling|tiefling]] races.
> - [[Fort Inevitable]]: Fort Inevitable stands as a stark and somewhat inexplicable blemish in the otherwise fiercely abolitionist [[River Kingdoms]]. Here, slavery is the fate of desperate debtors, common criminals, and "vagrants."
> - [[Geb's Rest]]: The ravenous [[Undead|undead]] of Geb keep large numbers of [[Mortal|mortals]] enslaved as feeding stock. In addition, upon death, a free mortal's remains are raised as mindless undead.
> - [[Irrisen]]: Ruled by [[Jadwiga]], Irrisen keeps its native [[Ulfen]] population entrapped in various degrees of slavery. Commoners live the lives of enserfed peasants, while the house servants in Irrisen's cities are openly treated as chattel.
> - [[Jalmeray]]
> - [[Katapesh]]: The yellow-sailed ships from the Katapeshi city of [[Okeno]] are the most well-known and feared agents of the slave trade on the [[Inner Sea]].
> - [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]: The [[Ulfen]] traditionally keep [[Thrall|thralls]], a form of time-limited slavery.
> - [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] *(unique form of enslavement for giants)*
> - [[Molthune]]: Slavery here is encouraged, but tightly regulated by the government. Slaves with enough understanding of the law have the ability to eventually emancipate themselves and become full citizens.
> - [[Numeria]]: The [[Kellid]] tribes of Numeria practice Thralldom just as the [[Ulfen]] do, and the [[Technic League]] keeps large numbers of slaves in [[Starfall]].
> - [[Osirion]]: Once indulged in the slave trade as fervently as Katapesh and Qadira, but after a recent slave revolt, now uses slavery only as a way of punishing certain criminals. The children of slaves no longer inherit their parents' status.
> - [[Qadira]]: Has an economy heavily dependent on the practice of slavery.
> - [[Rahadoum]]: The owning of chattel is commonplace in this godless nation on Garund's northern shore.
> - [[Sargava]]
> - [[Shackles]]: Pirate slavers often raid the [[Sodden Lands]] and the interior of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] for slave stock.
> - [[Varisia]]: The city of [[Kaer Maga]] has conflicting attitudes to slavery. Slaves can be bought in [[Downmarket]], and are particularly common in the [[Ankar-Te]] district, but in the [[The Bottoms]] district enslaving another is a capital offence.
> - [[Taldor]]: The [[Oppara Arena|arena]] in the capital city of [[Oppara]] has daily slave fights.

## Slavery in southern Garund

> - The demon-worshiping [[Bekyar]] of coastal southeastern Garund extensively trade slaves they brand according to each slave's origin and abilities.

## Slavery in Tian Xia

> Slavery is not limited to the Inner Sea region and is also practiced throughout the continent of [[Tian Xia]]. This is especially true in the monstrous nations of [[Chu Ye]], [[Kaoling]], [[Shenmen]], and [[Wanshou]], where humans and other native races are kept as chattel, but also in the lands of [[Minata]], [[Nagajor]], and [[Shaguang]], as well as the underground [[Darklands of Tian Xia]]. Slavery is even found in the cosmopolitan city of [[Goka]], although it is heavily regulated there.


## Other slaver races

> Even though slavery is common in many [[Human|human-dominated]] nations, it is also found among Golarion's non-human races.

> - [[Derro]]: The inhabitants of [[Corgunbier]] (under the Candlestone Caverns of Andoran) are enthusiastic slavers.
> - [[Drow]]: The dark elves of [[Sekamina]] are known slavers.
> - [[Duergar]]: The grey dwarves are known to be the most prolific slavers of the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Nar-Voth]], and the city of [[Hagegraf]] (under the northernmost portion of the Five Kings Mountains) is their capital.
> - [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll]]: Gnolls tend toward laziness, and prefer their slaves to do the hardest jobs whenever possible.
> - [[Hobgoblin]]: These goblinoids take slaves by force whenever possible, treat them with the utmost cruelty, and generally work them to death.
> - [[Kobold]]: As they are among the weakest of the humanoid races, kobolds are often taken as slaves by others.
> - [[Ogre]]: Ogres keep slaves, even of their own kind.
> - [[Stone giant]]: These giants often espouse a racist ideology based on their size, which naturally leads them to enslave smaller races.
> - [[Syrinx]]: This race of scholarly owlfolk enslave other races they view as lesser beingsâ€”a designation they apply broadly.

## Abolitionist nations

> - [[Absalom]]: Slavery was a complicated subject in the City at the Center of the World. It was looked down upon in the upper-class neighborhoods despite the law allowing slavery, the [[Flesh Taxes]], being reinstated in [[4635 AR]]. The buying and selling of chattels was always allowed on [[Misery Row]], a street in the [[Coins]] neighborhood, and most of the city's slave trade took place there. Slaves were rarely taken in Absalom itself, but were brought in from outside the [[Isle of Kortos]]; they were generally criminals or those with excessive debt. During the [[Fiendflesh Siege]] of [[4717 AR]], all slaves willing to fight for the city were granted freedom by [[Wynsal Starborn|Acting Siege Lord Wynsal]]; slavery was then outlawed by popular decree of the [[Grand Council]] in the same year.
> - [[AndoranAndoran and slavery|Andoran]]: Slavery was abolished in Andoran as one of the terms of the [[People's Revolt|Peoples Revolt]].
> - [[River Kingdoms]]: Settled largely by refugees fleeing serfdom and prosecution in foreign lands, the nations of the River Kingdoms prohibit slavery as part of their code known as the [[Six River Freedoms]].

## Organizations opposed to slavery

> - Among their other goals, the [[Eagle Knights]] of Andoran oppose slavery. Part of their mission of spreading Andoran philosophy includes combating the slave trade, including secretly raising a fleet, the [[Gray Corsairs]], which have been attacking slave ships since [[4705 AR]].
> - [[Andoren privateers]] are officially sanctioned in [[4709 AR]] and a division of the Andoren Navy called the [[Office of Privateering Actions]] grants letters of marque and tracks the actions of sanctioned privateers.
> - The [[Freemen]] of [[The Bottoms]] district of [[Kaer Maga]] actively oppose slavery in the city.
> - The [[Bellflower Network]] and their [[World/NPCs/Bellflower tiller|tiller agents]] work in secret to subvert Chelish enslavement of halflings.
> - [[Cervapral|Cervaprals]] are [[Agathion|agathions]] dedicated to championing liberty, and as such fervently oppose all forms of slavery and bondage.

## Historical slavery

> - Slavery was practiced thousands of years ago in the first human empire: [[Azlant]].
> - The [[Runelords|runelords]] of ancient [[Thassilon]] enslaved the [[Giant|giants]] of that land to build their cyclopean monuments. Any who proved too independent or difficult were placed in a runeslave cauldron, a magical device that transformed any giant into a mindless drone: [[Runeslave|runeslaves]].
> - The inhabitants of the [[Ird|Lost City of Ird]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] were known to have kept massive numbers of slaves.

## Slavery and religion

> Although the follower of many gods keep slaves, few deities bother to make the institution part of their permanent bailiwick. Those who do include the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] deity of slavery and toil, [[Droskar]], the [[Goblin|goblin]]/[[Barghest|barghest]] deity [[Hadregash]], the [[Orc|orc]] god [[Lanishra]], the [[Fire giant|fire giant]] god [[Zursvaater]], the [[Harbinger|daemonic harbinger]] [[Jacarkas]], and of course the Prince of Laws, [[Asmodeus]].
> [[Cayden Cailean]] and many of his followers are staunch abolitionists and oppose slavery whenever possible, as are the followers of the minor protector-goddess [[Milani]].


## Slavery on distant worlds


### Akiton

> - The Free Peoples of the High Plateau of [[Arl]] were enslaved long ago by [[Azlanti human ethnicity|Azlanti visitors]] and refuse to suffer enslavement from any new thuroks.
