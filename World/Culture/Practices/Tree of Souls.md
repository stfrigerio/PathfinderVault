*For another meaning of "Tree of Souls", please see Tree of Souls (Kasai).*
> While many nations hang criminals and prisoners from tall trees as a warning to others, the [[Ulfen]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] have managed to construct an [[Effigy|effigy]] that takes this to a violent extreme. The **Tree of Souls** is crafted from dozens of bodies nailed, bound, or impaled onto a wooden frame. Some warlords pride themselves on using very little wood in these structures, leading to the structural integrity of a 20 to 30-foot-tall "tree" being composed primarily of the bodies of its victims.
