> The **Blood Eagle** is one of the most horrifying [[Ulfen]] [[Effigies|effigies]] used in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], usually reserved for hated enemies and other powerful foes. In it, the victim has an eagle carved into their back, then the torturer opens up the victim's ribcage to spread the lungs out across their back like wings, before their body is put on display.
> The [[Linnorm King]] [[Sveinn Blood-Eagle]] is named after the practice.
