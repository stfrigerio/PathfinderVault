 A brimorak demon; all demons can speak Abyssal.

> Some believe that **Abyssal** was the first [[Language|language]] developed by the inhabitants of the [[Outer Sphere]], although this is very difficult to prove given its incredible rate of linguistic change. Abyssal is the native language of the [[Demon|demons]] of the [[Abyss]], although it is also spoken by many [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Devil|devils]], [[Daemon|daemons]], or others who have frequent dealings with races of the lower realms.


## Abyssal on Golarion

> Abyssal is spoken on [[Golarion]] in the [[Worldwound]], a region in northern [[Avistan]] with a direct connection to the Abyss that is overrun by demons. In [[Tian Xia]], Abyssal is most commonly spoken among the [[Oni|oni]] and other [[Evil|evil]] [[Spirit|spirits]]. It is also a very useful language when traveling through the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Drow|drow-controlled]] areas of the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Sekamina]], given the dark elves proclivity for demonic pacts and servants.
