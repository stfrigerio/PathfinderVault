 The symbol of the Darklands.

> Being such insular communities, the inhabitants of the Darklands have developed a specialized terminology or slang all of their own, many terms of which have made their way into a number of the languages spoken there.

> - **Cold walk**: A tunnel that dead-ends into an area covered by water.
> - **Darklander** or **Darksider**: Someone who lives in one of the three layers of the Darklands.
> - **Dead walk**: A dead-end tunnel that terminates in a rock fall or other impenetrable obstruction; also something that has no further practical use (a played-out mine, etc).
> - **Deepbaiting**: When a darklander tricks a surface-dweller into danger in the Darklands.
> - **Deepmeat**: A surface-dweller who has met a grisly fate in the Darklands (*see deepbaiting above*).
