> There are countless [[Human|human]] languages spoken on the surface of [[Golarion]]. Below is a sample of human languages spoken around the globe.


## Common

> **Common** is a relative term used to denote the most prevalent [[Human|human]] language spoken in a particular region. For instance, [[Taldane]] is the most widely spoken language on the [[Continent|continents]] of [[Avistan]] and northern and eastern [[Garund]] and so is referred to as Common in the [[Inner Sea region]]. In western Garund, however, the [[Mwangi]] language is used as the lingua franca. In [[Tian Xia]], the most widely spoken language is [[Tien]], and so that is classed as Common on that continent. It may be that on other continents, other human languages are classed as Common.


## Dtang

> Dtang is the tongue of the [[Tian human ethnicity|Tian]] ethnic group known as the [[Tian-Dtang]] who primarily inhabit the nation of [[Dtang Ma]] in southeastern [[Tian Xia]]. It is also spoken by a sizable minority population in the city-state of [[Goka]].


## Erutaki

> This is the native tongue of the [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] people of the [[Crown of the World]].


## Hallit

> This harsh, guttural tongue spoken in rapid staccato is native to the the [[Kellid human ethnicity|Kellid]] people originally from the north of Avistan, and centers around survival and war. Although many northern [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarian]] tribes use versions of Hallit that have no written form, at least one ancient one does exist. It is spoken by a significant portion of the population in the following countries: [[Brevoy]], [[Galt]], [[Mendev]], [[Nirmathas]], [[Numeria]], [[Razmiran]], the [[River Kingdoms]], and the [[Worldwound]].


## Hon-La

> Hon-La is the native language of the [[Tian-La]] people who reside in northernmost [[Tian Xia]], mostly in the nations of [[Hongal]] and [[Shaguang]]. It is also spoken by a sizable minority population in the city-state of [[Goka]], in the [[Wall of Heaven Mountains]], and in the mountain nation of [[Zi Ha]].


## Hwan

> Hwan is the native language of the ethnic [[Tian-Hwan]] of [[Hwanggot]], although it also became popular among those rebelling against the empire of [[Lung Wa]] and those who now fight against its [[Successor States]]. Hwan is also spoken by a sizable minority in the city-state of [[Goka]].


## Iobarian

> The Iobarian language is the native tongue spoken in the [[Iobaria|Iobarian]] area of the continent of [[Casmaron]] by many species, not just the [[Iobarian human ethnicity|Iobarian]] ethnic humans. It has a runic script.


## Kelish

***Main article: [[Kelish]]***
> Kelish is the language of the [[Kelesh|Great Padishah Empire of Kelesh]] far to the east of the Inner Sea. It is a throaty, phlegmatic language rich with poetry, scholarly writing, and history, having served the empire for countless generations. It is also widely spoken by the [[Genie|genies]] of that land, and in the [[Inner Sea region]] in [[Absalom]], [[Alkenstar]], [[Geb's Rest]], [[Katapesh]], [[Nex]], [[Taldor]], and of course [[Qadira]], the westernmost [[Satrap|satrapy]] of the Great Empire. The traders of Kelesh are so ubiquitous that the language is even spoken by a sizable minority in the great city of [[Goka]], in distant Tian Xia. The language evolved from the tribal languages spoken within the Empire of Kelesh.


## Minatan

> Minatan is the common language of the [[Wandering Isles]], spoken by those who travel among the hundreds of isolated communities found throughout [[Minata]], and is the native language of the [[Tian-Sing]] people. The local languages are all related to Minatan, and a speaker of Minatan can generally communicate effectively with its people. It is most commonly spoken in southeastern Tian Xia, and is also spoken by a sizable minority in the city-state of [[Goka]].


## Minkaian

> Minkaian, sometimes called "Minkan", is spoken in the [[Minkai|Minkai Empire]] as the native language of the [[Tian-Min]] peoples. The language is related to [[Tien]] and is also very widely spoken in Tian Xia, especially the northern and central regions of that continent, including particularly [[Jinin]], [[Shokuro]], [[Chu Ye]], [[Wanshou]], and the city-state of [[Goka]].


## Mwangi

*For other meanings of "**Mwangi**", please see [[Mwangi disambiguation]].*
> **Mwangi**, also known as **Polyglot**, is the collective name given to the numerous dialects of the [[Mwangi human ethnicity|Mwangi]] peoples inhabiting central and western [[Garund]]. The various groups can generally understand one another, and it is believed all of the dialects are derived from an unknown root language. Mwangi is spoken mainly in the [[Mwangi Expanse]], [[Vidrian]], and the [[Shackles]].


### Words

> - **ali**: "to be eaten"
> - **mzali**: "the eaten palace" or "devoured palace", the name of the city of [[Mzali]]

## Osiriani

> This is the most widely spoken language on the continent of Garund. It is a direct descendant of [[Ancient Osiriani]], which modern speakers can partially understand. It is a majority language in [[Osirion]], [[Alkenstar]], [[Geb's Rest]], [[Nex]], and [[Thuvia]], and spoken by a sizeable minority in [[Katapesh]] and [[Rahadoum]]. Osiriani has a deep lexicon of precise [[Magic|magical]] terminology.


## Razatlani

> Razatlani is the ancient language of the [[Razatlan|Razatlani Empire]] of [[Arcadia]], which covered most of the continent. It is still used today as the common language of the modern-day nation of [[Xopatl]].


## Senzar

*See also: [[Nonhuman languages of GolarionSenzar]]*
> Senzar is the truly ancient language of the [[Spirit|spirits]] of [[Tian Xia]], and spoken most frequently by the [[Kami|kami]] of the [[Forest of Spirits]] as well as the inhabitants of the [[Wall of Heaven Mountains]]. Scholars believe that it may be the root language of all human tongues on the continent, as many words associated with the spirit world or [[Dragon|dragons]] have Senzar roots. It is also spoken by minority populations in the nations of [[Chu Ye]] and [[Hongal]].


## Shadowtongue

> Spoken with any frequency only in the shadowy country of [[Nidal]], where it is used for ceremonial purposes and to keep outsiders from eavesdropping. Shadowtongue is a mix of Taldane, [[Languages of the Great BeyondInfernal|Infernal]], and [[Dead languages of GolarionAzlanti Ancient Azlanti|Azlanti]]. It is a sibilant language of quiet hisses and whispered words. Many words are pronounced with a delicate intake of breath. Non-speakers who hear it often remark that it sounds like it is being spoken backwards. The [[Strix|strix]] of the [[Devil's Perch|Devils Perch]] mountains in nearby [[Cheliax]] refer to it as Whisprin and believe that it is not only inherently evil, but that it is the cause of Nidal's cultural malignancy.


## Shoanti

> Spoken by the [[Shoanti human ethnicity|Shoanti]] people of [[Varisia]], this language has many similarities to Hallit, Varisian, [[Nonhuman languages of GolarionGiant|Giant]], and ancient [[Dead languages of GolarionThassilonian|Thassilonian]]. A person who speaks any of these three language can communicate basic ideas to a Shoanti, although learning the language is necessary to truly earn these proud people's trust. Shoanti speakers often embellish the language with eloquent metaphors.


## Sign languages

> Several groups use sign and gesture languages to communicate. As deafness and muteness are unusually common among [[Varisian|Varisians]], many know a highly developed sign language. This method is also used by the [[Sczarni]] as a silent thieves' cant.


### Napsu-Sign language

> Members of the [[Pathfinder Society]] also use their own system of signs to silently communicate, known as **Napsu-Sign language** or **Pathfinder Hand Signs**. While originally created to communicate basic ideas loosely based on [[Taldane Common|Taldane]], it has been expanded over time into a robust sign language with about 1,250 universal signs and hundreds of additional signs in regional dialects. Few Pathfinders are fully fluent, but most know enough to communicate common adventuring concepts—such as the number and types of threats in a room, or to call for help—covertly or urgently.


## Skald

*For another meaning of "Skald", please see [[Skald]].*
> Skald is the language of the people of the far north-west of Avistan, in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. It sounds both sonorous and harsh to the southern ear and has a chanting, sing-songy quality with long, complex words. Skald uses the [[Dwarven|dwarven]] alphabet with a few letters imported from Taldane. Other than in its homeland, it is also spoken in [[Brevoy]], [[Irrisen]], and [[Ustalav]].
> 


## Taldane (Common)

> Taldane is the most widely spoken language in Avistan and Garund; indeed, it is often referred to as **Common** across the [[Inner Sea region]]. It is a trade language which takes its alphabet from ancient [[Jistka]] and its numerals from Kelish. Most of the terms and grammar are based on ancient Azlanti, although Taldane also borrows from Varisian. It is thought to be one of the oldest human languages still spoken in the Inner Sea region, and is certainly the most widely spoken. Many localities in Avistan have their own particular slang words or phrases, and the most well-known of these is [[Korvosan slang]].
> Taldane is also spoken in the north and west of the continent of [[Tian Xia]] by those who trade heavily with the Inner Sea region. It is also the national tongue of the Taldan colony of [[Amanandar]] there, and is beginning to spread to other countries in that region.
> 


## Tien (Common)

> This complex language is spoken by the [[Tian human ethnicity|Tian]] people from regions of the once-great [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]]. Its use is so prevalent that it is often referred to as **Common** in that part of the world. It contains nearly 24,000 pictographs and is a tonal language with thousands of homophones. Even though Lung Wa has long since faded from prominence, Tien remains the official tongue of most of mainland Tian Xia. A pidgin Tien is spoken in the [[Valashmai Jungle]].


## Varisian

> Varisian is the language of the native [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisian]] people of Varisia. Vocabulary and grammar are based on a mix of [[Nonhuman languages of GolarionOrc|Orc]], Taldane, [[Nonhuman languages of GolarionGiant|Giant]], ancient Thassilonian, and a now defunct proto-Varisian language. It is known for its subtle nuances and double-meanings, and is a perfect tool for innuendo. It is spoken by a minority of the population of any of the countries these nomadic people have traveled to or settled in over the millennia, including [[Brevoy]], [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], [[Molthune]], Nidal, Nirmathas, and Ustalav.


## Varki

> Varki is the native language of the semi-nomadic [[Varki]] people who live in the far north of [[Golarion]], centered in [[Icemark]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]].


## Vudrani

> Vudrani is believed to have been born in the [[Dhavala River]] basin in distant [[Vudra]], and has been heavily influenced by both Tien and Kelesh. Speakers tend to add many prefixes and suffixes in conversation, making for many difficult-to-pronounce and lengthy words. Derived from the language of its ancient kings, Vudrani is the primary language of Vudra, and [[Vudrani human ethnicity|its people]] believe it is the tongue of the [[Vudran pantheon|gods]]. It is also spoken on the island of [[Jalmeray]], and in [[Katapesh]] and [[Nex]]. On the continent of [[Tian Xia]], Vudrani is the most commonly spoken foreign tongue. It can be frequently heard in the trade city of [[Goka]] as well as the southwestern parts of that landmass.
