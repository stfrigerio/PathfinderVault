## Communism in Bachuan

> First instituted by the peasant-philosopher [[Grandfather Pei]], the tenets of communism center on the equality and comradeship of all humanoids and the struggle between social classes. Following Grandfather Pei's teachings, an army of farmers, miners, and fisherfolk took up arms against their callous imperial rulers and the corrupt priests who helped prop them up. Under the communist government established following the revolution and headed by Pei, all people of Bachuan were declared equal, religion was outlawed, the state assumed communal ownership of all property, and all citizens were expected to share equally in labor and the rewards thereof.
> In practice, the utopian promise of communism proved harder to implement, with growing autocracy, reeducation camps, and ideological purges marking the last years of Pei's life. Most blamed his young and extremely zealous wife Pu Yae Men, better known as [[Grandmother Pei]], for the shift away from her late husband's teachings. Today, Bachuan's government is a perpetrator of frequent state violence and seeks to spread Grandmother's vision of communism throughout Tian Xia, by the sword if necessary.
