> The **Aucturn Enigma** is a theory connecting the rapid [[Technology|technological]] and [[Magic|magical]] advances that occurred during the reign of the [[Four Pharaohs of Ascension]] in [[OsirionHistory|Ancient Osirion]] to strange and powerful forces from the [[Planet|planet]] [[Aucturn]]. The most widely known scholar studying the Aucturn Enigma was the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] [[Imivus|Paracount Imivus]], who authored the *Aucturn Lexicon* and probably died while exploring the [[Demiplane|demiplane]] of [[Ramlock's Hallow|Ramlocks Hallow]].
> The enigma is especially tied to the numbers **56 and 11**, the alignment of the planets [[Golarion]] and [[Aucturn]]—which occurs every 56 years—the [[Numeria|Numerian]] mineral [[Veinstone|veinstone]], and the phenomena of [[Mind quakes|mind quakes]].
