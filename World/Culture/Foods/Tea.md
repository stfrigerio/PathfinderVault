> **Tea** is an extremely popular, warm beverage drunk in many regions of [[Golarion]]. Green tea and black tea are the main types depending on provenance and preparation of the leaves. To prepare tea, the leaves are infused with boiling water and brewed for a few minutes. Tea can then be drunk black or with the addition of milk, and may be sweetened with sugar, lemon, or [[Spice|spices]]. Tea costs between 4 and 8 [[Copper piece|cp]] per pound of leaves.



## Origins and history

![[An_odd_meeting.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Jatembe|Old Mage Jatembe]] takes tea with [[Baba Yaga]] in the Dancing Dolphin in [[Taldor]].
> The origin of tea has become legendary with numerous stories associated with it. Scholars tend to conclude that a famous [[Tian]] imperial advisor, called Luyu and styled the Father of Tea, discovered the tea plant and introduced the drink to the imperial court. Luyu discovered the plant in Nanang Province near to [[Xa Hoi]] and [[Dtang Ma]].
> Tea plants have now been cultivated in many parts of [[Tian Xia]] for some 10,000 years, but some wild tea trees still exist on the slopes of the Kao Shan mountains.
> Four thousand years ago saw the introduction of tea to [[Vudra]], where it also quickly became popular. [[Vudrani]] planted and started to cultivate their own tea plants which grew to be different from the original Tian species. Indeed, Vudra started exporting its tea variety to Tian Xia.


## In Tian Xia

> Tea culture is a unique facet of Tian life, as the Tian take their tea very seriously. Tea is prevalent in all walks of life and all levels of society in Tian Xia, and it is more popular than [[Alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] in much of the continent.


### Tea ceremonies

> Courtiers from the ancient empire of [[Yixing]] first began to formalize the drinking of tea, or *cha* in their language, in [[2664 AR]], when the first ***chadao***, or ***xhadao***, tea ceremony was performed for their emperor. These customs eventually grew into the highly ritualized *chadao*, or tea ceremony. Some decades later, visitors from [[Teikoku]] (the modern day [[Minkai|Minkai Empire]]) copied them by creating their own ***chanoyu*** tea ritual. Today, *chadao* is practised in the lands that were once [[Lung Wa]], in addition to [[Xa Hoi]], and [[Dtang Ma]]; whilst *chanoyu* takes place in Minkai.
> A tea ceremony set costs around 25 gp and contains a teapot, tray, whisk, bowl and four small teacups; the set is housed in a beautifully decorated box.


## In the Inner Sea region

> Tea is consumed in many places in the [[Inner Sea region]], with black tea competing with [[Salt|salt]] in its presence in culinary markets. Black tea is a common drink in the morning and afternoon, and are often drunk with additives like lavender and rose water.
> Tea houses of [[Oppara]] are legendary both in the social and culinary world of the Inner Sea region, equalled only by the spiced teas of southeast [[Garund]], where mint teas are so popular they have made their way to parts of [[Avistan]].

> The [[Barzillai Thrune|Lord-Mayor]] of [[Kintargo]] banned drinking tea after curfew in [[4715 AR]].


## In the Great Beyond

> [[Nualidu]] [[PathfinderWiki/Culture/Races/Azata|azatas]] are strongly opposed to tea, considering it (and any other brewed beverage) a corruption of water.
