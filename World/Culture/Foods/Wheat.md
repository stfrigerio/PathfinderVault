> **Wheat** is a commonly planted cereal grain in the [[Inner Sea region]]. It is so ubiquitous, that merchants use it as a [[Trade good|trade good]] in lieu of [[List of currencies|coin]]. A pound of average quality wheat can generally be sold for one [[Copper piece|copper piece]].


## Planting

> Most wheat is planted in the spring and harvested in the fall, while winter wheat is planted in the winter to be harvested in the summer or early fall of the following year.
> The [[Carpenden Plains]] of [[Andoran]], with their loamy soil and hot summers, are said to be nearly perfect for growing wheat, as are the [[Sirmium Plains]] in neighboring [[Cheliax]], or more distant [[Ardeal]] in [[Ustalav]]. Wheat is quite hardy, however, and can grow in less than ideal conditions, such as in the valley of [[Kragnaroth]], high in the [[Mindspin Mountains]] of the [[Hold of Belkzen]], or in the marshy soils of the [[River Kingdoms]]. Wheat is an important staple even in lands that have limited or no growing seasons, such as the ice-bound realm of [[Irrisen]], although it has to be imported there. Wheat is also a staple in [[Tian Xia]], where [[Amanadar|Amanadaran]] wheat is frequently traded throughout the continent.
