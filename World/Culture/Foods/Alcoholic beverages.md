![[Soldier_fight.jpg|right+hmed]]

The tough grapes are practically inedible, but are fermented with a particular yeast, grain and wood mushrooms to make a distinctive and rough beer considered an 'acquired taste' by visitors to the town.


### Bufo

> This disgusting concoction is made by adding [[Poisons of Golarion|toxin]] from a poisonous [[Toad|toad]] or [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Frog|frog]] to beer. The poison is inserted in different ways, such as soaking the amphibian in the ale, soaking its eggs in the ale or milking the poison from the amphibian and then mixing it in. Bufo is not consumed in civilized societies, but [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Goblin|goblins]], [[Boggard|boggards]] and other primitive [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Humanoid|humanoids]] lap it up, sometimes eating the amphibian as a bonus at the end of their drink.

> Dwarves have an ancient heritage of brewing strong ales since before the [[Quest for Sky]]. The potent liquors brewed in those early times with ingredients from the [[Darklands]] are approximated today by blending exotic ingredients with traditional grains and hops. In some cases, these special dwarven brews begin to take on characteristics akin to [[Magic|magic]] [[Potion|potions]], though still crafted using [[Alchemy|alchemical]] methods; these are the dwarven magic ales, including:


#### Boulderhead Bock

> Boulderhead Bock is a malty ale known for a thick and creamy froth. The additional effect of this brew is to numb pain.


#### Icecap Ale

> By repeatedly partially freezing this brew and removing the ice, the alcoholic content of Icecap Ale is forced up to ten times that of normal ale. This ale additionally boosts the strength and fortitude of the drinker but at a price of fatigue and memory loss greater than for a normal hangover.


#### Longbeard Lambic

> Longbeard Lambic is an ancient recipe that can pull a drinker out of fatigue and fear.


#### Wyrm's Breath Bitter

> Wyrm's Breath Bitter is green-coloured, extremely fizzy and very bitter. Unfortunately, the ale causes nausea but as a secondary effect grants the imbiber a noxious belch acting similarly to a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dragon|dragon]]'s breath weapon. Those smelling the belch are sickened and deafened.


### Dwarven Stout

> Dwarven stouts come in many varieties but are essentially dark beers fermented in dwarven societies but often found in other civilized lands nearby. Recipes are fiercely guarded within clans and there is much competition amongst dwarves for producing the best beer.

### Mead

### Nodrim

### Three Devil Ale

## Wine, Fortified Wine & Viniculture

![[Kess%27s_spectators.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Nothing pairs with a [[Kess|Taldan brawler]] quite like a fine red wine.
> [[httpenwikipediaorgWine|Wine]] is fermented fruit juice dominated by the grape. Wine can be cheap but some varieties are distinctly luxury purchases costing many gold pieces per bottle.
> Wine is the drink of choice around the Inner Sea, where grapes are a common plant. Even cheaper establishments are sometimes expected to serve a complimentary cup of wine—often a strong or coarse vintage diluted by water—although rough wines like that are not served at more esteemed places, especially considering the region's saturation with exceptional wines from [[Taldor]] and [[Cheliax]]. [[Honey wine]] is a common wine enjoyed by almost everyone, but the most decadent of all is [[Bubble wine|bubble wine]], especially the original "Carpenden".

It affects the snake-men as normal wine does humans, and is poisonous to most creatures. These drinks cost 100 gp.


### Bubble Wine

> Bubble wines are fermented with yeast and sugar. The original bubble wine was produced near [[Carpenden Hill]] in [[Andoran]] and is simply called "Carpenden."

Still, [[Taldor|Taldan]] wineries have their own varieties that taste close to the original, even if never quite as good.


### Chelish Wine

> Both red and white wine are produced in [[Cheliax]] including wine of the highest quality. [[Varian Jeggare]] owns vineyards in western Cheliax that produce both red and white wine. Notably fine Chelish wines include Wiscrani Barbera wine.

### Elven Wine

> [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Elf|Elven]] wine is very fine in quality and sweet in taste; it may even exceed a fine [[Galt|Galtan]] vintage wine in quality (see below). The alcoholic potency of the wine is often unrealized by those drinking it until much later. Elves of [[Kyonin]] also create subtle wines made from berries. Midsummer wine is made by the elves of Kyonin to celebrate the summer festival. It is a delicate white wine yet has a pleasing length.


### Galdurian Wine

> This wine may be aged to improve its quality and can be worth many gold pieces per bottle.


### Galtan Wine

> Galtan wine can be very fine and smooth on the palate, though the revolutionary nature of the country currently makes wine making very difficult. Quality is sufficient enough that vintage wines may be made to lay down; these vintage wines may be sweet.

The blood of someone who has recently drunk sangwine is embittered and it sickens creatures who feed on such blood, such as [[Vampire|vampires]].


### Sarain

> Some of the best wine distributed in the [[Inner Sea region]] is harvested in the vineyards of [[Sarain]] in the [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Pitax]].

> The monks of Whiterose Abbey used to be expert vintners (and brewers) blessed by [[Cayden Cailean]] such that their products gained in flavour and alcoholic strength. The abbey is found close to [[Mount Branthlend]] in the [[River Kingdoms]]. Wines known to have been produced include fine Whiterose chardonnay worth a fortune if sold today.


### Wine of concordance
