This disease can even be contracted by just drinking the water that blackscour mushrooms have grown in. Some races that live underground supposedly cultivate these mushrooms, although why is not currently known as there is currently no known beneficial use for blackscour.


## Appearance

> Blackscour mushrooms are short and fat, with a black cap covered with small, white spots. The smells that they emit are easily confused with that of a rotting corpse, and tastes bitter.


## Known locations

> Blackscour most commonly grows underground. An above-ground patch has been found in [[Darkmoon Vale]]. Rumor is that the [[Kobold|kobolds]] living in the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] ruins of [[Droskar's Crag|Droskars Crag]] forced it to the surface.
