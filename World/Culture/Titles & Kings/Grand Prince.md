> **Grand Prince** is the hereditary title given to the emperor of [[Taldor]], who wears the [[Primogen Crown]]. The Grand Prince has absolute authority as long as he maintains good relations with the Taldan army. By law, the title is passed via primogeniture from the father to the eldest son, although this law was overturned by the Taldan Senate in [[4718 AR]] thus allowing female heirs to take the mantle. There were numerous times in Taldor's history when rule was passed to a related family with only a tenuous claim to the throne but this only occurred when there was no direct male heir and thus the law of primogeniture did not apply. 
> The current Grand Prince(ss) of Taldor is [[Eutropia Stavian]], the daughter of the previous Stavian III.


## History

> The title of Grand Prince was first coined by [[Taldaris]] of [[Oppara]], who conquered the disparate city-states along the eastern shores of the [[Inner Sea]] to found the nation of Taldor in [[-1281 AR]].
