> The **Dragon Kings** have ruled the Empire of Dragons, [[Xa Hoi]], since [[-1987 AR|513 IC]], although how they came to rule the nation is one of [[Tian Xia|Tian Xias]] great mysteries. The first Dragon King was [[Pham Toan Rong]], though how he came to get this title has been forgotten over the millennia. An unbroken line of rulers links the current Dragon King [[Pham Duc Quan]] to his ancient liege Pham Toan Rong.
