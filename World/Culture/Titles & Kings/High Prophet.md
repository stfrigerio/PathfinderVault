> The **High Prophet** is the head of the [[Druma|Kalistocracy of Druma]], a nation of fanatically-devoted merchants in central [[Avistan]]. The title is currently held by [[Kelldor|High Prophet Kelldor]], who rules the nation with the help of a council of merchants-lords known as the [[Resplendent Bureaucracy]]. Unlike other positions within the Resplendent Bureaucracy, the office of the High Prophet is the most influential and therefore most profitable in all the land, possible in the entire [[Inner Sea region]]. The office of the High Prophet, along with the rest of the Resplendent Bureaucracy, is headquartered in the capital city of [[Kerse]].
