> A **Linnorm King** is a ruler of one of the kingdoms within the nation known as the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] in the north-western reaches of [[Avistan]]. To become a Linnorm King, a contender must defeat a [[Linnorm|linnorm]] in single combat and carry the creature's severed head through the gates of the city he or she wishes to rule. Legends state that one day a Linnorm King will rise to unite all the regions of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings and that this **High King** will need to slay the 'Father of All Linnorms', [[Fafnheir]], to claim that title. The very first Linnorm King, [[Saebjorn Arm-Fang|King Saebjorn Arm-Fang]], attempted this prize but failed.
