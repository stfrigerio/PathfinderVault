> **Hellknights** embody order in its purest form, beginning with their own hierarchy and strict **system of ranks**.



## Lictor / Vicarius

> The **lictor** (or **vicarius** if promoted from the signifers) is the general of a [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknight order]]. Currently, the [[Order of the Gate]] is the only existing branch of the Hellknights led by a vicarius.


## Master/Mistress of Blades

> The **master of blades** or **mistress of blades** is the field marshal and answers only to the lictor of the Hellknight order.


## Paravicar

> **Paravicar** is the leader of an order's signifers, equal in rank to a master or mistress of blades and answers only to the lictor of the Hellknight order.


## Paralictor

> **Paralictors** are Hellknight officers ranking below the master of blades or the paravicar.


## Maralictor

> **Maralictors** are Hellknight officers ranking below the paralictors.


## Hellknight

> **Hellknights** are the rank-and-file seasoned knights of the order.


## Signifer

*See also: [[World/Culture/Titles & Kings/Hellknight signifer]]*
> **Signifers** are the Hellknights who are capable to use the either [[Arcane magic|arcane]] or [[Divine magic|divine magic]].


## Armiger

> **Armigers** compose the order's largest population and they are not yet full members of the order. To gain the status of Hellknight, armigers must first pass a trial known as **The Test**. In the Test a would-be Hellknight must fight against a [[Devil|devil]] summoned from the depths of [[Hell]].
