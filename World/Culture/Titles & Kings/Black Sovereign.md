 Kevoth-Kul, on his throne as the Black Sovereign of Numeria

 The flag of Numeria
> The **Black Sovereign** is the title given to the ruler of [[Numeria]] and this title has been practically synonymous with 'ruler of Numeria's tribes' since its inception in [[4031 AR]]. The current incumbent is [[Kevoth-Kul]].
> A Black Sovereign is not like a monarch—where an obvious successor usually takes over power on the death of the former leader—much time may pass after the death of a Black Sovereign before the next is declared. Few records exist regarding the history of the Black Sovereigns—even in death, they are not buried but stripped naked and thrown into the Bonehall, a pit that predates [[Starfall]] and contains the jumbled remains of every Black Sovereign. As such, their total number and many of their names are unknown.


## Consort

> Most Black Sovereigns traditionally take a consort, who effectively serves as the Sovereign's second-in-command. The consort of current Black Sovereign Kevoth-Kul is the [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarian]] [[Kul-Inkit]].
