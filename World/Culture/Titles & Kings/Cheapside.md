> **Cheapside** is a catch-all term used by the upper classes of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] capital of [[Egorian]] to describe any of the city's low-rent districts. Depending on whom is speaking, it can include such neighborhoods as Riverside, [[Devil's Dance|Devils Dance]], [[Dice End]], and the Bilgetown.  The most discriminating of nobles would even include such upper-middle-class neighborhoods as Briarpatch, [[Triumph]], and Parley Circle under this pejorative descriptor.
