> **Beastkin** is a term for all creatures who have gained the ability to transform partially or completely into an [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Animal|animal]] while retaining a strong connection to their [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Humanoid|humanoid]] side. They are sometimes, though often ignorantly, referred to as **skinwalkers**. The most common variety attained their abilities through being descended from [[Lycanthrope|lycanthropes]].



## Adventurers

> Beastkin often become [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]], [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]], [[Fighter|fighters]], [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]], [[Rogue|rogues]], [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]], and [[Witch|witches]].


## Heritages

> Beastkin vary depending from which animal they have gained their characteristics, depending from which species of lycanthrope they are descended, and can be classified into a number of different heritages.


### Bloodmarked

> **Bloodmarked** (also known as **werebat-kin**) are descended from the sinister [[Werebat|werebat]] race. Although not as vicious as their bestial forebears, the bloodmarked are known for their lust for blood, love of strict rules, and following the flock mentality.


### Coldborn

> The descendants of the solitary [[Werebear|werebears]] call themselves the **coldborn** or **werebear-kin**, and are most often known as fierce defenders of [[Golarion|Golarions]] wild places, especially in northern [[Avistan]] and [[Tian Xia]].


### Fanglord

> **Weretiger-kin**, or **fanglords** as they sometimes call themselves, are most commonly encountered in distant [[Vudra]], Tian Xia, [[Jalmeray]], and the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. Convinced of their own greatness, these beastkin are known for their unpredictable behavior and fickle attitudes.


### Nightskulk

> **Nightskulks** can trace their lineages back to [[Wererat|wererats]], and most often rely on stealth or subterfuge to make their way in the world.


### Ragebred

> The **ragebred** or **wereboar-kin** have all of their [[Wereboar|ancestors]] fierce temperament, stubbornness, and fiery emotions.


### Scaleheart

> **Scalehearts**, the distant progeny of [[Werecrocodile|werecrocodiles]], are most commonly found in the [[Shackles]], [[Osirion]], and [[Thuvia]]. They most often display a steely calm, but are also known for their patience and ruthlessness.


### Seascarred

> The descendants of the fearsome [[Wereshark|weresharks]], **seascarred** or **wereshark-kin** see themselves as nobility among the other races of beastkin. Their methods are usually quite blunt, and they prefer simple lives of hunting and eating.


### Witchwolf

> **Witchwolves** or **werewolf-kin** are perhaps the most common race of beastkin to be found throughout the [[Inner Sea region]] and beyond. They generally live amongst themselves in small, semi-nomadic communities and make their livings as entertainers, mystics, or [[Adventurer|adventurers]].


### Other beastkin

> Beastkin can have the characteristics of almost any animal or beast, including [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dinosaur|dinosaurs]], [[Wasp|wasps]], [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Eagle|eagles]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spiders]], and many more.


## On Golarion

> Although beastkin can be found in both Avistan and [[Garund]], particularly in areas with high lycanthropic activity, such as [[Andoran]], [[Cheliax]], the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], and the [[Ironbound Archipelago]], they are most common on the distant continent of [[Arcadia]].
