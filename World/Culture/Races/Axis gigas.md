> **Axis gigas** are a race of [[Gigas|gigas]] created by the [[Titan|titans]] from the very substance of the [[Plane|plane]] of [[Axis]]. They are allies of the native [[Axiomite|axiomites]], who used the Axis gigas to turn the tide in battle against the invading [[Protean|proteans]] and other foes from the [[Maelstrom]] aeons ago. They disappeared from view after the war, but are said to still lie beneath the streets and grassy hillocks of the Eternal City, ready to protect it should other resistance from within Axis prove insufficient.


## Appearance

> Axis gigas are said to resemble enormous [[PathfinderWiki/Manuals/Giant|giants]] clad in metal.
