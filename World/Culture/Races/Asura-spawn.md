> **Asura-spawn**, or **faultspawn** as they are sometimes called, is the name given to [[Tiefling|tieflings]] who are descended from the violent inhabitants of [[Hell]] born of the mistakes and accidents of [[Deity|gods]]: the [[Asura|asura]]. Like their asura ancestors, faultspawn tend to derive a deep joy from witnessing the myriad failures of the gods and will often devote themselves to the ruin of religions whose values and beliefs do not align with their own. Physically, asura-spawn tend to exhibit both masculine and feminine traits simultaneously but also tend to possess odd physical traits, such as forked tongues, or long limbs that can twist in strange, disturbing ways.
> Asura-spawn are most common in distant [[Vudra]] but can also be found in the [[Inner Sea region]] on the exotic island nation of [[Jalmeray]]. They can also be found in [[Mendev]] where they delight in undermining the efforts of pious crusaders; and in [[Rahadoum]], where they share the [[Atheist|atheistic]] nation's disdain for the gods.
