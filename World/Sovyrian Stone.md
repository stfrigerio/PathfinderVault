> The ***Sovyrian Stone*** is an enormous crystal, which the [[Elf|elves]] use to control the ancient [[Portal|portal]] arch that links [[Golarion]] to the fabled [[Elf|elven]] land of [[Sovyrian]]. In addition, the crystal also provides the power for all the [[Elf gate|aiudara]] or "elf gates" used by the elves to instantaneously travel across the world. Though the artifact is well known to all within [[Kyonin]], it is well-hidden somewhere in the capital city of [[Iadara]]; few have ever laid eyes upon it.


## History

> The true history of the *Sovyrian Stone* has been lost to the ages. Legends speak of the mythical elven hero, [[Candlaron the Sculptor]], who created both the *Sovyrian Stone* and the [[Elf gate|elf gates]] that the elves use to this day. These [[Elf gate|elf gates]] form a network throughout the elven homeland of [[Kyonin]] and across [[Golarion]]. These gates, although thousands of years old, are mere copies of the far more ancient magical [[Portal|portals]] that exist on Golarion.
> After the exodus of the elves from Golarion via the portal controlled by the *Sovyrian Stone*, the exiled demon [[Treerazer]] attempted to wrest control of the stone in [[2632 AR]] and attempted to refocus the link away from [[Sovyrian]] and forge a connection to the [[Abyss]] instead. This prompted the return of the elves and Treerazer's plans were foiled as a result.


## Religion

> Followers of the elven [[Deity|goddess]] [[Alseta]] revere all *aiudara* and the *Sovyrian Stone* in particular as sacred. [[Paladin|Paladins]] of the goddess are tasked with protecting the [[Artifact|artifact]] with their lives.
