> **Serpent's Run** is the largest building in [[Magnimar]], quite a feat in the so-called city of monuments, and is located in one of the city's most prosperous areas, the [[Marble District]]. The Serpent's Run serves Magnimar as its arena and most popular entertainment venue; the hippodrome can seat up to 5,000 people, over a quarter of Magnimar's total population. Unlike many other arenas, the Serpent's Run specialises in non-bloodsports like [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|dog]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Horse|horse]] racing, decathlons, and [[Magic|magic]] displays. However, the late-summer rodeos sponsored by the [[Matador's Lodge|Matadors Lodge]] are also held here.
> The arena is named for the carving of a gigantic [[Serpent|serpent]] that runs around the upper rim of the arena, a tribute to the serpent slain by [[Alcaydian Indros]]. It is run by Master of Games [[Jorston Droaeb|Jorston Axetongue Droaeb]].
