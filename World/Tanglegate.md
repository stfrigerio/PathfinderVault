> **Tanglegate** is an [[Elf gate|elf gate]] in the [[Demon|demon]]-corrupted forest of [[Tanglebriar]]. It can be reached via [[Lichgate]], which is the only known example of a working elf gate that links to Tanglebriar. Its portal key is a sapphire.
> [[Treerazer]], the lord of Tanglebriar, hopes one day to be able to use Tanglegate against the [[Elf|elves]], and so he has ordered his minions to refrain from destroying it. The gate itself is a stone arch covered in moss, and it stands on a rare patch of dry ground in the middle of a stinking bog.
