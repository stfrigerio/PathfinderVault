> **Viperpool** is the ruined remains of [[Arima]] in [[Avernus]], the former domain of the deceased [[Archdevil|archdevil]], [[Typhon]]. When the rest of Arima was lifted into the air to become the [[Promised Land]] of [[Barbatos]], the remainder of the dark garden-realm was cast into twilight and its ruins and [[Serpent|serpent]]-dens were overtaken by the clinging vegetation of the [[Infernal duke|infernal duke]] [[Furcas]]. What was left behind by Barbatos is now a section of the Knight of Laurels' expanded domain.
