> [[Domain|Domains]] are broadly defined as [[Divine|divine]] concepts worthy of devotion, the source of all [[Magic|divine magic]]. Some divine scholars theorize that each domain is further divided into two or more **subdomains**, and that a [[Cleric|cleric]] may find herself bonding with such a subdomain within her [[Deity|deitys]] portfolio instead of its parent domain. This further 'specialization' is reported to grant the cleric a somewhat different array of divine powers than those received by clerics who devote themselves to the parent domain. Adherents of this theory further believe that a particular deity's control of a domain does not necessarily grant that deity control over each of its subdomains. [[Gozreh]], for instance, is reported to command the Water subdomain of Oceans but not that of Ice, and has no authority whatsoever over the Animal subdomains of Feather and Fur. It has been further observed that a few of the 'known' subdomains appear to belong to more than one domain.


## Apocryphal subdomains

> Apocryphal subdomains associated with a particular deity are rare, only accessible via obscure texts called apocrypha and often only utilized by extreme members of a faith. In the articles below, apocryphal subdomains are clearly marked with a superscript  to distinguish them from standard subdomains.
