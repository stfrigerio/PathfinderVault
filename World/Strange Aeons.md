“

In a distant land polluted by an alien menace from beyond the [[Star|stars]], a great cancer grows within the earth. As its tendrils reach out through the dreams of those who learn and study its existence, a sinister cult grows more active in preparing the way for a devastation that will destroy more than the minds of would-be heroes. Can the [[Adventurer|adventurers]] reclaim lost memories in time to stop the advance of a cataclysmic contagion that could threaten all of [[Golarion]]? Can they resist the mind-shattering truths revealed by the Yellow Sign, and the monstrous force it symbolizes? The Strange Aeons Adventure Path pits the heroes against the cosmic horrors of the [[Lovecraftian influences in Pathfinder|Cthulhu Mythos]], with new monsters, mind-shattering terrors, and explorations far beyond the known lands of Golarion.
