> The **Rasping Rifts** is the name of the [[Abyssal realm]] of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Deskari]] full of insectoid monstrosities. There are already many direct routes from the Rasping Rifts to the [[Worldwound]] on [[Golarion]] where Deskari's influence is most perniciously felt. Deskari rules from within a ruined city, inundated by a lake of agonized [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]]. Those not devoured by Deskari or his servitors slowly transform into hive-mind vermin that populate the Rasping Rifts.
