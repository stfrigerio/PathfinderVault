> The **Treaty of Sirathu** is a peace treaty which was signed between the warring cities of [[Korvosa]] and [[Kaer Maga]] in [[4663 AR]].  It is named after the small town of [[Sirathu]], located approximately 15 miles south of Kaer Maga on the [[Yondabakari River]].  In addition to pledging continued peace, Kaer Maga ceded all territories below the [[Storval Rise]] to Korvosa.  Although tensions have continued, the treaty has yet to be broken.
