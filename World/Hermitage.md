> **The Hermitage** is a small, barren island just off the southern tip of [[Mediogalti Island]]. It is named after its only inhabitant, a mysterious old man known only as the [[Hermit]]. The Hermit lives in a small, ramshackle hut made of driftwood and is rumored to have some kind of connection with the [[Mayor of Ilizmagorti]] or the [[Eye of Abendego]] itself.
