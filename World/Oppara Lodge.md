> The **[[Pathfinder lodge]] in [[Oppara]]** hides behind the fa√ßade of a greasy bait and tackle shop. It provides the standard services to [[Pathfinders]] but is notable for its *[[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Wayfinder|wayfinders]]*, produced by an elderly and talented mage-machinist, who is also the lodge's [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]], named [[Muesello]].
