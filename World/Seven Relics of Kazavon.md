The **Seven Relics of Kazavon** are [[Major artifact|major artifacts]] created from the bones of the dread [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] [[Kazavon]], a servant of [[Zon-Kuthon]]. They are all imbued with a portion of the undying [[Dragon|dragons]] [[Spirit|spirit]], and are quite intelligent.



## History

> Kazavon was defeated at [[Scarwall]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]] in [[4063 AR]] by the hero [[Mandraivus]] and his cohorts. Even after the dragon was dead and dismembered, they noticed that the pieces tried to move toward each other and bind themselves back together. Not wishing for Kazavon to be reformed, each of the companions took a part of his body and dispersed them throughout [[Golarion]]. Eventually, because of their great innate [[Magic|magical]] power, each of the skeletal parts were reformed into a powerful [[Magical item|magical item]]. They are described in further detail below.
