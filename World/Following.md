> A **following** is a [[Kellid]] term denoting a collection of tribes congregating around a single leader, who is typically referred to as a **herder**. Followings are most commonly found in the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] as part of the collective [[Mammoth Lords]]. Upon the herder's death, a following either chooses a new leader, joins another following, or breaks back apart into smaller tribes. Because the qualifications for leadership include performing great acts of bravery, heroism, or guile, the turnover among leaders is quite high.

> The most powerful following in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords in the [[Bearpelt following]], which is led by the herdsman [[Kuldor|Mighty Kuldor]]. Followings and tribes in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords are always nomadic and travel on foot, although they use domesticated [[Mammoth|mammoths]] or other large [[Animal|animals]] to pull their gear, tents, and possessions on huge [[httpenwikipediaorgtravois|travois]].
