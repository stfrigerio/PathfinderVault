> The **Forsaken** are a mysterious pantheon of vanished [[Evil|evil]] [[Demigod|demigods]] from the [[Shadow Plane]].


## History

> After [[Earthfall]], the Forsaken listened to the prayers of the refugees from the [[Azlant|Azlanti]] trading outpost of Calignos and bestowed upon them the [[Artifact|artifacts]] known as the *[[Cradle of Night|Cradles of Night]]*, eventually reshaping them into the [[Dark folk|dark folk]]. The Forsaken initially planned to use the power of their worshippers' [[Soul|souls]] to escape the Shadow Plane, but before they could do so, they disappeared in an enigmatic calamity. Their fate is unknown; shortly after they vanished, the [[Owb|owbs]] emerged, and the dark folk switched their worship to these new patrons, in the process mostly forgetting the Forsaken.
> While the dark folk are no longer capable of calling upon the Forsaken, the owbs can, and successfully contacting a Forsaken turns an owb into an [[Owb prophet|owb prophet]], a conduit that can grant [[Spell|spells]] to [[Cleric|clerics]] on their patron's behalf. However, all owb prophets seek to hoard this [[Deity|deific]] energy for themselves instead of gladly passing them to their patron, and some of them devise long plans to become independent demigods. If such a plan were to succeed, that owb prophet would become the only active Forsaken in the [[Great Beyond]], but none has reached this goal so far.


## Known Forsaken

> Traces of Forsaken worship persist, especially in the Shadow Plane and other dark places, but their current state and abilities are not fully understood. Notable among the memorialized Forsaken are:

> - **[[Enkaar]], the Malformed Prisoner**: Once imprisoned on the [[Shadow Plane]], Enkaar emerged mutated and draped in chains.
> - **[[Eyes That Watch]]**: Little is known of this Forsaken, who appeared only as three [[Cat|cat]]-like eyes staring from shadows.
> - **Grasping Iovett**: This Forsaken's figure of heavy black [[Silk|silk]] shifting between innumerable enticing forms belied a pustular, verminous touch.
> - **[[Husk]]**: Taking the form of a hollow, gap-jointed [[Humanoid|humanoid]], Husk embodied emptiness, loneliness, and narcissism.
> - **Lady Razor**: This stern Forsaken prohibited acts of kindness or mercy toward relatives.
> - **[[Reshmit]] of the Heavy Voice**: A hulking figure of shadow with a punishing touch and rending voice, Reshmit was a Forsaken embodiment of violence.
> - **Thalaphyrr Martyr-Minder**: The Forsaken's prisons were guarded by Thalaphyrr, who represented failed heroics and wasted time.
