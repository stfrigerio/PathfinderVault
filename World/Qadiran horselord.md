 A Qadiran horselord.
> **Qadiran horselords** are fleet and indefatigable mounted combatants whose traditions originated with the renowned [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Horse|horse]]-breeding [[Al-Zabriti]] tribes of [[Qadira]], but are now known across the [[Inner Sea region]]. The term "horselord" was applied by outsiders.
> Horselords lack the tactical prowess often associated with [[Cavalier|cavaliers]] but are exceptionally fast riders and adept at leaping attacks, and are as devastating with a one-handed [[Sword|sword]] as many of their cavalier compatriots are with a lance. The most adept horselords can easily slice through enemy lines.
