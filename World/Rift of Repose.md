> The **Rift of Repose** is a hidden and unclaimed rift within the [[Abyss]], where accumulates the quasi-souls of [[Demon lord|demon lords]] that have been slain. Their very power and worshippers mean that, even in death, something of the demon lord survives: the demon lords' remnants manifest as fossilized forms on the wall of the Rift.
> Though this place remains unclaimed it is not uninhabited. Mythic [[Nalfeshnee|nalfeshnees]] known as Curators act as self-appointed custodians who watch over the fossilised corpses.
> Sometimes, [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|righteous]] beings will invade the Rift with the hope of obliterating the demonic remains to ensure such [[Evil|evil]] can never be resurrected. Unfortunately, these corpses have a habit of reforming elsewhere in the Rift after being destroyed. Even more troubling, the remains have been known to spontaneously resurrect upon reforming on rare occasions.
