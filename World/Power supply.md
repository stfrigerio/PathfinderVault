> Most [[Technology|technology]] encountered on [[Golarion]] requires a **power source**, of which most have been destroyed, expended, or dormant since the [[Rain of Stars]]. There are two primary power sources still available: **batteries** and **generators**.

## Batteries

> Batteries are specially crafted cells, often portable, that store power over extended periods of time in a stable physical form, allowing it to be expended as needed. Batteries have limited capacities and must be recharged once spent.
But certainly not available in markets outside of [[Numeria]].


## Generators

> Generators continually produce power, either by consuming fuel or converting other forms of ambient power. Such power conversion makes generators dependent on being near a fuel source or too cumbersome to be easily moved. While a generator with sufficient fuel does not run out of power when used, it does have a maximum output capacity, its *yield*, that may cause other connected technology to fail if exceeded.
