> **Venture-captain** is a position of regional authority within the [[Pathfinder Society]]. After surviving long, esteemed careers as [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]], members of the Society who choose not to retire are honored with their own [[Pathfinder lodge|lodge]], and a handful of Pathfinders who report to them. A venture-captain receives his or her orders directly from the [[Decemvirate]], passing these on to their assignees. In return, Pathfinders submit detailed notes, maps, and relics from their adventures to their venture-captain in the hopes of reading their exploits in the pages of the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]*.

> When referring to venture-captains, no capitalization is necessary. However, when using venture-captain as a title, capitalize both words. A hyphen is always placed between the two words. For example: *The venture-captain in attendance was Venture-Captain Adril Hestram.*
