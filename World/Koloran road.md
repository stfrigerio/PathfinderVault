> The **Koloran roads** are a network of ancient stone roads spanning the modern nation of [[Iobaria]], built by fallen [[Koloran Empire]] of the [[Cyclopes|cyclopes]] before their collapse during [[Earthfall]]. First discovered by [[Ulfen]] explorers, these roads are the only way to traverse Iobaria's more dangerous regions, such as [[Fangard]] or the [[Grenalf|Grenalf Plateau]], and provide the sole means of reaching the city of [[Kirya]]. However, the roads themselves are dangerous in places, with mechanical traps from the age of the cyclopes continuing to claim lives, while in other regions such as the [[Hills of Nomen]], [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] and other non-[[Human|human]] races attack those who do not respect their sovereignty.
