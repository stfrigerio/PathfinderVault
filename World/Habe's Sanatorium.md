> **Habe's Sanatorium**, formally known as the **Saintly Haven of Respite**, is south of [[Sandpoint]] along [[Cougar Creek]] near the [[Ashen Rise]].

To raise funds for upkeep and his research, Habe has taken a silent partner, the elderly [[Varisian]] [[Caizarlu Zerren]]. Habe employs two [[Tiefling|tiefling]] brothers, [[Gortus]] and [[Gurnak]], as orderlies. Habe maintains a working [[Laboratory|laboratory]] where he conducts experiments on his patients that might cross ethical boundaries.
