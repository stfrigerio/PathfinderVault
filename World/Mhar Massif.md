> The **Mhar Massif** is one of the tallest mountains in all of [[Golarion]], standing at 31,565 feet tall. Located in [[Varisia]]'s [[Kodar Mountains]], it is also the site of [[Xin-Shalast]], the former capital of the ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] realm of [[Shalast]]. Even today, a vast carving of the final Runelord of Greed, [[Karzoug]], may still be seen on the southern side of the mountain.
