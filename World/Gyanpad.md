> **Gyanpad** is a mountain within the larger [[Lohaparbat Mountains|Lohaparbat Mountain]] chain in the [[Falling Mountains]] region of [[Vudra]]. Gyanpad is most famous for the [[Garuda|garuda]] [[Monk|monk]] called [[Mahadev]] who has meditated near its peak for over a decade. A small cult has developed around Mahadev to help keep his body nourished and alive, although they claim his spirit has already ascended to a higher plane and may be in the process of becoming a [[Deity|god]]. Unfortunately Mahadev's psychic emanations have drawn monstrous [[Yeti|yetis]] and [[Wendigo|wendigos]] to Gyanpad and the surrounding area.
