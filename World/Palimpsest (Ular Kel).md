> **Palimpsest** houses most of the scribes, sages, and [[Magic user|magic users]] that make their homes in the [[Karazh]] capital of [[Ular Kel]]. The district was partially destroyed in the Great Scroll Fire but was rebuilt and is now home to a wide arrange of shops, including apothecaries and various [[Arcane magic|arcane]]-focused shops. The merchants of Palimpsest often advertise using incredible [[Illusion|illusions]] to lure in prospective customers. It is said, however, that the district's most powerful spellcasters do not bother with such grandiose displays and, instead, seek out their customers directly themselves. The [[Chirographica]], one of the greatest centres of learning in all of [[Casmaron]], is mainly located within Palimpsest.
