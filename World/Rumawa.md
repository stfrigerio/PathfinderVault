> The **Rumawa** are a tribe of the [[Mwangi Expanse]], living near the lost city of [[Drowning Stones]]. They guard the ruins from intruders. They believe that the Drowning Stones caused their ancestors to commit suicide, and do not approach the ruins.
> They are crocodile totemists, and scar their skin in an attempt to resemble crocodile scales. Thye expect visitors to their territory to sacrifice game animals to their totem; failure to do so is likely to lead to violence.
