> ***Yokai*** is a [[Minkaian]] term for spirit world creatures, such as [[Kami|kami]], [[Oni|oni]] and [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]]. These creatures are associated with the dead or they live between the everyday [[Material Plane]] and the Planes beyond. Within the wider [[Tian Xia]], *yokai* may be used more loosely to express something which is not understood.
