> A spirit-wolf in primordial times, **Thron** was one of the most powerful of his kind.  He was known as the **Prince That Howls**, and he traveled the wilds of [[Golarion]] howling praises to life, love, and song. He had many mates and sired many more spirit-creatures, but two of his offspring transcended the power of spirits and became deities—the goddess [[Shelyn]] and the god [[Dou-Bral]].
> When his son left Golarion and returned as [[Zon-Kuthon]], Thron was overjoyed to see him again, twisted as he was, but the feeling was not mutual. Zon-Kuthon bound his father in razor-sharp chains, silenced his songs, and carried him off as a toy to be tortured. Over time, Thron's mind, body, and soul were stripped from him, and he now serves his sadistic master as his son's [[Herald|herald]]—the [[Prince in Chains]]. This shocking betrayal of their father turned Shelyn against Zon-Kuthon and incited another conflict between the siblings during which Shelyn was able to wrest Whisperer of Souls from Zon-Kuthon.
