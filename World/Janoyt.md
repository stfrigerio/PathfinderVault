> **Janoyt** was once a meagrely populated county of [[Ustalav]] bordered by [[Avalon Bay]] and the county of [[Varno]]. At the refounding of [[Ustalav]], after the defeat of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] in the 39th Century AR, the county was predominantly controlled by the [[Melcat|Arch-Duchy of Melcat]] and the new rulers of Ustalav granted the county to the Archduke's total control. Eventually, the ex-county became the theocracy of [[Razmiran]], as it remains today.
