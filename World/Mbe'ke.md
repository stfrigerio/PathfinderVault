 A Mbe'ke dwarf.
> The **Mbe'ke** [[Dwarf|dwarves]] live in the [[Terwa Uplands]] of the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. They are one of the two main dwarven groupings in the Expanse, but have little contact with the other group: the [[Taralu]] dwarves of the eastern jungles. They congregate in villages of several hundred individuals, and live relatively traditional dwarven lifestyles.
> Rumour has it that there is an intact [[Sky Citadel]] in their territory and that the Mbe'ke have close relationship with the primal [[Cloud dragon|cloud dragons]] that live in the mountain ranges around the citadel.
