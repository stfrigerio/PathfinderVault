> The ruined city of **Narona** is located on [[Hellmouth Gulf]] on the western coast of [[Cheliax]] on the [[Arcadian Ocean]]. The city was destroyed by the [[Chelish Navy]] because of its resistance against the rule of [[House Thrune]]. The inhabitants of Narona (unlike those of the nearby city of [[Pezzack]]), never returned after the settlement's destruction.
