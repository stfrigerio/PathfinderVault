> **Godsward** is one of the seven floating districts that make up the [[Djinni Empire|djinni]] capital of [[Armun Kelisk]] and serves as its religious heart. While [[Djinn|djinn]] on the whole are not particularly devout, Armun Kelisk allows adherents of the many faiths that venerate the wind and sky to commune directly with the elements themselves. The greatest of Godsward's temples is the [[House of the Infinite Strata]], devoted to the god [[Gozreh]]. Godsward is also home to the [[City of the Departed]], where the djinn build temples devoted to minor [[Deity|deities]] and the their ancestors. These ancestral shrines serve as a reminder to the djinn that despite their theoretically limitlessly lifespans, all great djinn will eventually have to face death.
