> **Telepathy** is a form of non-verbal communication that takes place directly between minds. Telepathy can have many sources, ranging from the psychogenic secretions among [[Xulgath|xulgaths]], to [[Spell|spells]] that form telepathic bonds between multiple creatures. A mechanical, wave-based type of telepathy is even said to be employed by the inhabitants of the [[Planet|planet]] [[Aballon]].
