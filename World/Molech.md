> **Molechs**, sometimes called molochs, are hollow statues of [[Bull|bulls]] or bull-headed [[Humanoid|humanoids]]. Usually made of metal, these statues are used to perform the most sacred rituals to the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Moloch]]. These statues are used in the *passage of fire* and Feast of Flames; rituals where objects, animals, and sentient humanoids are sacrificed to Moloch. Especially devote followers will even sacrifice the souls of their own children in these devices, their souls sent to serve in the General of Hell's army. Most common molechs are lit by hand and utilize ordinary fire, but the interior of magical variants can automatically ignite in [[Hellfire|hellfire]] when a sacrifice is placed inside. Molochâ€™s armies often travel with a wagon carrying a molech and are used to inspire the soldiers before a battle.
