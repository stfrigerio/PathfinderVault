 The banner of the Hold of Belkzen.
> The [[Orc|orcs]] of the [[Hold of Belkzen]] congregate in tribes, which is the extent to which they are organized into any semblance of order. These tribes may be comprised of more than just orcs and often include [[Slaves|slaves]] or even fully accepted members of other races including [[Giant|giants]], [[Ettin|ettins]], and [[Ogre|ogres]]. An unstable hierarchy and constant warfare maintain the balance of power between the tribes, and alliances and feuds rarely last long. Many tribes commission battle menageries (cages full of monsters to be loosed onto the battlefield) and [[Siege engine|siege engines]], when engaged in frequent warfare with other tribes. The names selected for these tribes are designed to frighten those who find themselves facing them across the battlefield.

## Tribal Banners

> Each of the tribes of the Hold of Belkzen has a battle standard that is carried with them wherever they go. The tribe's symbol or namesake is depicted on the standard, and it is normally hung from a long [[Spear|spear]] decorated with the trophies of past battles. This flag never leaves the chief's side in battle (although it is generally carried by a subordinate), and is immensely important to the tribe's morale. Most of these standards are very old, and sometimes [[Magic|magical]], and hold nearly religious significance to a tribe's members. If a standard is lost in battle, a chief will do anything to get it back.
