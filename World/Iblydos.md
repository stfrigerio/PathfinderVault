> **Iblydos** is an island nation in an archipelago off the coast of [[Casmaron]] in the [[Obari Ocean]]. It is said to be among the oldest known [[Human|human]] civilizations in Casmaron.



## History

> Very little is known of this ancient land, although it is often grouped with other ancient empires of that continent, such as [[Kaskkari]] and [[Ninshabur]], even though it is unclear whether they were located in the same general region. Those few histories which mention a connection with those lost empires indicate that Iblydos had longstanding contact with the [[Cyclops|cyclops]] nations of that continent, whom they labeled the "[[Koloran]]". Some citizens of Iblydos even went as far as to join mystery cults that worshiped cyclopes.


### Influence of Ghol-Gan

> The people of Iblydos owe their existence to the cyclopes that emigrated from [[Ghol-Gan]] during that doomed empire's decline, and though the [[Giant|giants]] have dwindled in number since, they and humans continue to co-exist on the archipelago. The greatest mortals earn the rite of myth-speaking, in which the cyclopes foresee how that hero might attain mythic power through great deeds. Many of these so-called hero-gods have since ruled one of Iblydos's city-states, granting [[Spell|spells]] to followers and heralding in a new age of prosperity or tyranny. Since the deaths of [[Aroden]] and prophecy itself, the tradition has failed with troubling frequency. Now the last hero-gods age and dwindle, and a new generation of heroes must arise to combat the greatest threat to the islands: the [[Thalassic behemoth|thalassic behemoth]] Ousmariku.


## Geography

> Vast mazes exist beneath Iblydos. It was within these catacombs that the [[Minotaur|minotaur]] race first emerged.

## Economy

> A sea trade route called the [[Obari Crossing]], which has its western terminus in [[Katapesh]], passes through Iblydos on its way to distant eastern [[Kelesh]] and [[Vudra]]. The Iblydan traders who have mastered this dangerous route are among the [[Inner Sea region|Inner Seas]] most celebrated merchants, bearing exotic goods and secrets to wealthy buyers across [[Golarion]].


## Religion

> Iblydos is the birthplace of the mortal who would someday become the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Baphomet]], and his faith retains a strong following here.


## Creatures and races

> Iblydos is known as the birthplace of many infamous monsters, including the [[Medusa|medusa]], [[Hydra|hydra]], [[Harpy|harpy]], and [[Chimera|chimera]]. The mystical race of [[Sphinx|sphinxes]] have almost as long a history in Iblydos as they do in [[Osirion]]. The race of half-men known as [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] are said to originate in Iblydos as well.
