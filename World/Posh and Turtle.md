> Located at the west end of [[Korvosa|Korvosas]] [[Avenue of Arms]], the Posh and Turtle claims to be the finest inn north of [[Cheliax]]. The establishment's most prominent feature is the glass floor that reveals a sea cave below inhabited by an enormous sea turtle named Old Tom. For a great deal of its century-long history it was a [[Pesh|pesh]] den known simply as the Turtle. Over time, references to the "pesh in the Turtle" slowly changed to "posh and Turtle". When the current owner [[Thaviun Rigulus]] purchased the establishment a decade ago, he brought in fine furnishings and tableware and officially changed its name to "Posh and Turtle".
