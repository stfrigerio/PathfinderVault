 The Gold Goblin.
> The **Gold Goblin Gambling Hall** is a gaming hall and casino located in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Riddleport]]. Located in the bustling [[Wharf District]], it hosts a number of games of chance and skill, including [[Bounder|bounder]], ghoulette, golems, and skiffs.


## History

> Being within bowshot of the [[Velashu River]], the Gold Goblin enjoyed great success during its earlier days but time, competition, and mismanagement resulted in it falling from prestige. A new owner by the name of [[Saul Vancaskerkin]] purchased, renovated, and reopened the Gold Goblin in [[4708 AR]] with a gambling tournament he dubbed 'Cheat the Devil and Take his Gold'.
> Although the business began to regain popularity since its reopening, the death of its owner has left the business with an uncertain future.


## Appearance

> One of the first and finest gambling establishments in Riddleport, the Gold Goblin attracted attention with its brass-plated dome atop the casino and the eight-foot-tall statue of a [[Goblin|goblin]] at the front entrance. Although finely constructed, the building shows significant signs of decline.
