> The largest neighborhood, **Warmouth** is nestled at the city's southern entrance, so any travelers that enter the city must experience its orc-ish atmosphere upon entering [[Urglin]]. This district, comprising a large section of the city, houses [[Urglin]]'s "nobility" and government buildings: the Gray Donjon, which is comprised of a jail and military barracks, all seven of the Warlord Keeps, the War Tower, and the Rally Fields.
