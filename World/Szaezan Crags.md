> The **Szaezan Crags** are a range of mountains that take up most of western [[Bachuan]], abutting the [[Sea of Ghosts]]. Traditionally home to many brutalized miners and quarry-workers during the time of [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]], the people of the Crags were among those who rallied under [[Grandfather Pei]] during the [[Bachuan Revolution]]. Following the expulsion of the country's corrupt nobility, however, a growing population of [[Ogre|ogres]] has infested the Szaezan Crags.
> Although most of the aristocracy's wealth was confiscated by the [[Sun Chamber]] during the revolution, numerous hidden caches of wealth are thought to remain in the remote Szaezan Crags. Bachuan's [[Ministry of Peace and Harmony]] grants permits for adventurers to explore the Cragsâ€”with the expectation that most of their loot be ceded to the state.
