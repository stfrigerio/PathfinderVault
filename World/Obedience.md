> Certain devout individuals perform daily **obediences** to their [[Deity|god]], which consist of prayers, the use of certain holy items, minor sacrifices, and various rituals and other actions that demonstrate her devotion to the deity. If performed correctly, these obediences grant the person certain [[Divine magic|magical]] powers known as **boons** for the rest of the day. Failing to perform the daily obedience causes the devotee to lose access to the granted divine boon until it is successfully performed again. An obedience never takes more than one hour to perform. Certain highly skilled individuals ([[Evangelist prestige class|evangelists]], [[Exalted|exalteds]], and [[Sentinel prestige class|sentinels]]) are granted access to more powerful boons, which vary depending on their training.
