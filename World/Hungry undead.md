 Ghouls taking supper home
> Hungry undead are one of the four major types of [[Undead|undead]]. The horrible deaths of these beings were compounded when their [[Soul|souls]] were prevented from going to their afterlives. These beings, such as [[Mohrg|mohrgs]] and [[Ghoul|ghouls]], simply hunt through the [[Material Plane]], searching for victims. They try to create as much pain, death, and misery as possible.
