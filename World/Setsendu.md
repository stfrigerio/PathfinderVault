> **Setsendu** is a rolling plain located near the edge of [[Avernus]] that serves as the joint divine realm of [[Yaezhing]] and [[General Susumu]]. The skies of Setsendu are burning red, and the numerous small cities in the realm are constantly at war with each other, vying for General Susumu's favour or executing Yaezhing's cruel justice. The mountains of [[Stonepeak]], [[Minderhal|Minderhals]] divine realm, loom over Setsendu, but are far enough that there is little conflict between Minderhal's realm and Setsendu.
