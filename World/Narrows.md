> **The Narrows** is the poorest and most dangerous district of [[Oppara]], a tightly packed den of disease and squalor. The buildings here are often give out and crash into the narrow alleys. The streets are muddy, filth-ridden pits, and the stench of the place is often unbearable. The rooftops are cluttered and the rickety wood  houses lean and bow into one another, even into the ones on the opposite side of the street. The entire district is controlled by gangs and rogue guilds and even [[Oppara's Constabulary|Opparas Constabulary]] avoids the area unless marching on it with force. The [[Brotherhood of Silence]] is said to maintain a small chapterhouse in the district. The nearby [[Canal Row]] district has asked Oppara's Prefecture governor to build a wall between the two districts.
