> A **harrower** is a [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]] that draws power from the mystical [[Varisia|Varisian]] deck of cards known as the [[Harrow]]. Among other powers, a harrower gains the ability to draw cards from her deck to power up her [[Spell|spells]] with [[Metamagic|metamagic]]-type effects, and as she gains levels, she gains a bit more control over how these effects are applied.
