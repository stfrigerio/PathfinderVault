 The Narrows of Saint Alika are clearly visible on the right of this picture splitting the main city of [[Korvosa]] from [[Endrin Isle]].
> The **Narrows** or **Straight of Saint Alika** is a channel of water between [[Endrin Isle]] and the mainland in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]]. It is part of the [[Jeggare River]] and was named after [[Alika Epakena|Saint Alika the Martyr]], a [[Pharasma|Pharasmin]] seer whose prognostications helped warn the early [[Cheliax|Chelish]] settlers of [[Fort Korvosa]] of [[Shoanti]] attacks.


## Oysters

> The Narrows are rich with oysters, and the pink pearls harvested here have long fetched a premium price, so much so that merchants often claim their baubles to be Alikan Pearls.
