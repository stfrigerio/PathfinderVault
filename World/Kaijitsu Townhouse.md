> **Kaijitsu Townhouse**, sometimes termed **Kaijitsu Villa**, is the manor house of [[House Kaijitsu]], one of [[Magnimar]]'s newest aristocratic families. The townhouse has been mostly empty since [[4687 AR]] when the family became more concerned with their [[Sandpoint Glassworks|interests]] in [[Sandpoint]]. Magnimar's other nobles want the Kaijitsus to either sell the property or return to properly care for it.
