> The **Twisted Door** is an ancient set of bronze double doors at the foot of the cliff below the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]]. Some believe that it was constructed by the same unknown race that built the city.
> The doors are covered in strange runes in an unknown language. They also exhibit a strange optical phenomenon. The doors' edges appear perfectly straight, but an observer who follows an edge with his eyes somehow finds what was once an *outside* edge is now an *inside* edge, (or visa-versa). It is this effect that gives the door its name.
> Scholars are keen to study this effect, much to the irritation of the [[Duskwarden|Duskwardens]]. The Door serves as the entry to the [[Halflight Path]], and the sages interfere with the passage of the travellers the Duskwardens guide along the route.
