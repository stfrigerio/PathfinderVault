> The island of **Thistletop** sits in the [[Varisian Gulf]] off the coast of the [[Nettlewood]]. This strangely round rock formation contains an intricate and ancient ruin which delves deep into the center of the island. Currently held by the [[Thistletop goblins]], the site was actually once the head of a giant sentinel statue of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] nation of [[Shalast]], bordering on its bitter rival nation of [[Bakrakhan]]. Over the years since the fall of the empire, the crumbling statue's head has worn down into a spherical stone, though to this day locals still claim to see the face hidden within the eroded rock. The statue once contained a complex of rooms used by agents of [[Karzoug]], but in the modern age only a few of these remain.
