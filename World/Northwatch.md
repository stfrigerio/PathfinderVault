> **Northwatch** is a large keep of [[Castle Everstand]] with three towers on the northern side of the [[Kestrel River]]. The keep was constructed along with the reconstruction of the [[Voulge Bridge]] during the castle's last expansion in [[4701 AR]], under Captain Arald Gauntwood's supervision. This important accomplishment made Castle Everstand a single fortification that straddles the river.
