> **Vantian** is the name of the [[Abyssal realm]] of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Sifkesh]], called the "City of Open Windows" and the "Unshuttered". The city perches above the Abyssal sea of [[Ishiar]], [[Dagon|Dagons]] realm, which claims part of the city every day; in a seemingly endless task, city residents then rebuild on the other side of the city. Vantian is full of fallen priests serving in false temples to the [[Deity|gods]] they deserted in life before committing suicide.


## Geography

> Vantian's geography is highly unstable, as the city constantly creeps towards the edge of the cliff it rests on to crumble into Ishiar; as a result, few buildings or structures within it are more than a decade or so old. Only a few spots within it are truly stable in their position. One is Sifkesh's own demesne, which remains static thanks to its ruler's power as the rest of the city "flows" around it. Another is the Risen Light, a lighthouse spire that serves as the domain of the [[Nalfeshnee|nalfeshnee]] [[Wizard|wizard]] Erotundee. Rather than being anchored into the ground, the Risen Light floats just beyond the edge of the city, and is kept in position by a team of [[Retriever|retrievers]] chained to its base that cling to the cliff and crawl against its movement towards the ocean to keep the spire in position.
