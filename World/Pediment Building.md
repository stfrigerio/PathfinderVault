> The **Pediment Building** contains the [[Office of the Lord-Mayor]], plus [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] primary court and the [[Halls of Virtue]], as well as its only prison. The latter is located beneath the building: a prison known to all Magnimar as "[[Hells|The Hells]]". The Pediment Building is located atop the wealthy [[Summit Magnimar district|Summit]] region in the [[Capital District]] near the [[Usher's Hall|Ushers Hall]]. The building itself is large and intimidating, its vast exterior topped with imposing architecture and scowling gargoyles. Its inhabitants are scarcely less intimidating: the stern faced judges of Magnimar's [[Justice Court]].


## Halls of Virtue

> The Halls of Virtue are the private audience chambers of the judges of the Justice Court, and are located in the upper halls of the Pediment Building. The judges' roles are to interpret Magnimar's laws, fine or sentence wrongdoers, and settle disputes.


## The Hells

***Main article: [[Hells]]***
> Beneath the building is the city's only prison, The Hells. Amongst its claustrophobic corridors, the worst of Magnimar's criminals rot in a place where sunlight never reaches. Few know just how deep down the Hells really goes and there are rumours that the city guard no longer control the lowest levels. These rumours claim that there was some sort of uprising and the guards lost control so they sealed off the lowest levels leaving the worst of the city's criminals to fend for themselves.
