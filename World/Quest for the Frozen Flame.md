> **Quest for the Frozen Flame** is the thirty-first [[Pathfinder Adventure Path]] and is expected to run from January 2022 to March 2022.



“

In the brutal tundra of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, only the hardiest folk have what it takes to withstand unsparing weather, track down big game, and fight back hostile followings. The Broken Tusk following has survived another winter, but a new year just began, and signs of danger foretell a year unlike any before. Unless their newest party of scouts can secure a safe route through the wilds, saber-toothed beasts, warmongering rivals, and the ever-looming possibility of natural disaster all threaten to end an ancient people’s legacy. Will the Broken Tusks succumb to the elements and surrender to their rivals? Or will you guide your following to glory and reclaim a stolen birthright?

For generations, the Broken Tusk following has roamed their small patch of the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] in relative peace. Now, to avoid annihilation from a maniacal war horde, they must flee into the unknown.

Along the way, they'll uncover the mysteries of a powerful [[Artifact|artifact]] that promises to change the course of history.

With danger close behind, the Broken Tusks journey through the bountiful but treacherous Lost Mammoth Valley in search of the Primordial Flame. The Tusks' scouts solve the riddles of the primordial valley and recruit a motley league of unlikely followers, all while evading the watchful gaze of the vale's villainous overlords. In order to fulfill their quest, the scouts must ultimately go toe to toe with these vile masters: a vicious [[White dragon|white dragon]], a sadistic necromancer, and a boarish [[Beast|beast]]-god.

The Broken Tusks find sanctuary at last in the settlement of [[Hillcross]], but invading [[Frost giant|frost giants]] quickly force the clan's scouts to lead their mighty following's defense against the siege and take on new titles. To put a stop to the slaughter, the newly named [[Mammoth Lords]] take the fight to their foes by riding their bestial mounts through the sucking muck of the Tamarnian Tar Forest. At the heart of these black woods, amid the ruins of a half-sunken crusaders' castle, the heroes wield the sacred light of the Primordial Flame to defeat their ancient enemies once and for all.
