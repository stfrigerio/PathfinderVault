> **Willowmourn** is the estate of the ruling family of the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Amaans]], the Galdanas, and can be found on the western border of [[Lake Kavapesta]]. A sprawling possession, it contains topiary gardens, hedge mazes, a bountiful garden, not to mention a well-built and secure manor house. Rumors of wild debauchery there have persisted for a long time, although recently the gossip has taken a decidedly more sinister tone. Now gossips whisper of fearful hauntings and murder most foul.
