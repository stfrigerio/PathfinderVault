## Monitor expression

> Experience proctors are classed into four groups based upon their way of expressing their role in following their demigod. This expression of their faith is chosen by the proctor themselves and can be any one of the four expressions regardless of their [[Deity|deity]]. The four types are:

> - **Executor**: efficiency and order rules such a proctor's acts
> - **Foster**: supports social cohesion
> - **Harmonizer**: tries to bring balance to any situation where there is conflict
> - **Impulsive**: such a proctor allows their instincts free rein

## Other proctors

> Although "proctor", as described here, relates to a specifically ardent follower of a monitor demigod, the term proctor is often more loosely used to describe any devotee of the monitor demigods, or as a title such servants might use to describe themselves. However, other more specific titles do occur, such as:

> - [[Bailiff proctor|bailiff]], for those who serve [[Primordial inevitable|primordial inevitables]]
> - equitor, for those who revere the [[Monad]] and the ways of the [[Aeon|aeons]]
> - fettle, for those supporting the [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp ushers]]
> - radical, used solely by followers of [[Protean lord|protean lords]]
