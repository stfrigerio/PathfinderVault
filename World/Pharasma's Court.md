 Pharasma's holy symbol.
> Within the [[Boneyard]], a series of granite forums and plazas surround [[Pharasma's Palace|Pharasmas Palace]]. Collectively, these areas are known as **Pharasma's Court**. Despite the name, the [[Pharasma|Lady of Graves]] does not preside over these forums. Rather, this is where the [[Yamaraj|yamaraj]] are presented with the [[Soul|souls]] of [[Mortal|mortals]] whose lives did not reflect a particular [[Alignment|alignment]] and, therefore, require adjudication. Whenever an ambiguous case comes before one of these judges, representatives of the various interested parties (typically planar [[Outsider|outsiders]]) arrive to advocate for their particular case. During such trials, lesser [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]] act as bailiffs while also supplying relevant details about the life of the mortal soul in question. Such cases come up often, and are presented in a semi-orderly manner as each interested party argues fiercely for their case. On rare occasions, particularly when a mortal's soul is split between two radically opposed ideologies, these trials break down into violence.
