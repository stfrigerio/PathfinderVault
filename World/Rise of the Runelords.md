“

From the idyllically peaceful coastal town of [[Sandpoint]] to an ancient lost city at the top of the world, *Rise of the Runelords* takes a party of adventurers from 1st to over 18th level and delves into the mysteries of [[Varisia]]'s ancient past.  Millennia ago, the powerful empire of [[Thassilon]] ruled the land, dominated by despotic [[Runelords|runelords]] who maintained their power through harnessing the power of rune magic. Thought gone forever, the workings of Thassilon are not so far beneath the surface and one of the runelords plans a return to power. Only the brave adventurers stand in his way.
