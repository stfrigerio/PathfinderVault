> **Gravecharge** is the name of the central cathedral of [[Pharasma]] in the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] city of [[Lepidstadt]]. It is overseen by its head priest, Father Eswayne Cidaimoikis.


## Description

> Gravecharge is a large, domed structure across whose surface a massive skeletal cavalry force is depicted in relief racing in a spiral reminiscent of Pharasma's holy symbol. This grim facade pays tribute to Baldrumon Vielass and the order of knights he led in battle against the dragon Kulsyther, whose deaths allowed [[Soividia Ustav]] to conquer the northern reaches of modern Ustalav.
> Within the cathedral, before the pulpit, the remains of Vielass's knights and their steeds are interred in a 20-foot-deep ossuary. Some claim that to this day Vielass's lance remains driven through Kulsyther's jaws within this chamber.
