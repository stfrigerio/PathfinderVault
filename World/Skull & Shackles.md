**Skull's Crossing** is the name of the massive arched dam that holds back the waters of the [[Storval Deep]], releasing a steady stream into the [[Skull River]].  Located in central [[Varisia]] it is an ancient ruin from the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] era over 10,000 years ago.


## History

> Skull's Crossing was the final great work of [[Engineering|engineering]] completed by the [[Slavery|enslaved]] [[Giant|giants]] of the [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Karzoug]].  Most of the stone quarried to build the many monuments and cities all over the Thassilonian empire was taken from a single gigantic quarry on what is now the [[Storval Plateau]].  When this source was finally played out, Karzoug decided to do away with such a hideous eyesore, and had the dam built.  That way the water of the river would cover the huge empty hole, and ordered that the dam be decorated by one of his favorite symbols, the [[Human|human]] skull. These skulls have jaws that may be opened and closed by ancient machinery inside the dam, though this mechanism has not been used for centuries.
