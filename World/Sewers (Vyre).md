> The **Sewers** of [[Vyre]] are as ancient as the city itself but are well maintained by many guilds and organisations that use these tunnels for various nefarious purposes. Due to the heavy influence of the secretive [[Deity|god]] [[Norgorber]] over the city of Vyre, its sewers are riddled with thieves' dens, concealed shrines, hidden vaults, and all manner of other sinister constructions. Despite how heavily trafficked Vyre's sewers are, large swathes are still controlled by monstrous creatures ranging from trash-eating [[Otyugh|otyughs]] to tribes of [[Kobold|kobolds]], [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]], [[Faceless stalker|faceless stalkers]], and even more powerful creatures such as [[Naga|nagas]], and even [[Darklands]]-dwelling [[Seugathi|seugathi]] that lair within its deepest depths. Those criminal elements who utilise the sewers tend to avoid these monstrous infestations but the sewers are still a dangerous, treacherous place for anyone to venture.
