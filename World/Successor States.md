> The **Successor States** are a collection of sixteen small kingdoms and city-states that used to form the empire of [[Lung Wa]], formerly the greatest nation on the continent of [[Tian Xia]]. They are the home of the most populous of the [[Tian human ethnicity|Tian]] ethnicities, the [[Tian human ethnicityTian-Shu|Tian-Shu]], and are located on the far side of the continent from the [[Inner Sea region]], east of the [[Wall of Heaven]].
> Of the sixteen Successor States, the most powerful is [[Lingshen]], followed by [[Po Li]] and [[Quain]]. These three competing nations are considered the "true scions" to Lung Wa's might.


## History

> After the collapse of Lung Wa following the natural disasters that coincided with the death of [[Aroden]] in [[4606 AR]], hundreds of governors, warlords, noble families, and wealthy merchants began to divide the empire in a massive, continent-wide power grab. Fortunes rose and fell for decades in a series of wars that finally ended with the political situation that exists today.
