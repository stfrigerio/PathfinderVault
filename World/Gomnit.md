> [[Gnome|Gnomes]] subjected to the [[Drow|drow]] process of [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]] are called **Gomnits**.


## Appearance

> In appearance they resemble fleshy mushrooms. Their arms and legs disappear into their bodies, their heads flatten downwards, and their faces become mere featureless holes. The end result resembles a strange, fleshy mushroom. 


## Ecology

> Their fleshwarped bodies have proved to be perfect breeding grounds for slimes and fungi, especially Yellow Mould. The Gomnits themselves are immune to these parasites, but those who come into contact with them may not be so lucky.
> Gomnits are of no use to their drow creators. They are created as an amusing way of tormenting captured gnomes, or as works of art dedicated to [[Haagenti]].
