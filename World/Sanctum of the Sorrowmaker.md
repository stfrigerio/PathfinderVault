> **Sanctum of the Sorrowmaker** is a labyrinthine cavern complex in [[Dahak's Fang|Dahaks Fang]] island that [[Aashaq|Aashaq the Annihilator]] and her minions call home. The cave system riddles the entirety of the [[West Fang]] part of the island. Its main entrances are centrally located high on the cliff wall overlooking [[Fellhope Canyon]]. Aashaq's throne room and bloody temple to [[Dahak]], the patron [[Deity|deity]] of [[Evil|evil]] [[Dragon|dragons]], lie deep within the complex. The caves are inhabited by Aashaq's primary lieutenants: the [[Umbral dragon|umbral dragon]], [[Borshaggat]]; the [[Black dragon|black dragon]], [[Meshupullax]]; and the umbral dragon, [[Unguliustuk]]. They are also home to numerous servant creatures including [[Morlock|morlocks]], [[Slurk|slurks]], [[Tentamort|tentamorts]], and huge [[Vermin|vermin]]. Devotees of Dahak in [[Dragonsthrall]] on [[Dahak's Horn|Dahaks Horn]] island bring fresh [[Humanoid|humanoid]] sacrifices to the dragons. The victims are hauled deep into the labyrinthine complex while unconscious and left to awaken confused and lost. The dragons and other creatures of the Sanctum of the Sorrowmaker then enjoy the hunting game.
