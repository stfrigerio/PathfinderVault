> A **khamsin** is a powerful seasonal wind storm that often carries great amounts of dust and sand with it. It is most commonly encountered in the deserts of [[Osirion]], where the seasonal khamsins are capable of causing great destruction, and are capable of burying entire cities and regions. These storms are thought to be the product of fighting between the numerous tribes of [[Elemental|elementals]] who occupy that nation's empty places. Khamsin storms appear with such regularity, that they shape Osirion's national character, economy, and landscape as profoundly as the yearly flooding of the [[River Sphinx]].
