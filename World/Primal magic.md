## Associations

> Primal magic is fundamental to most [[Fey|fey]] beings, and some fey creatures will barter primal magic powers as abilities in exchange for mundane or esoteric details or abilities from the recipient, such as their ability to see the moon or a part of their name.
> Primal magic is also strongly associated with most [[Gnome|gnomes]], especially those who live in the [[First World]] and Feychild gnomes.
> It is also related to [[Elemental|elemental]] abilities, such as the ability of certain [[Dwarf|dwarves]] to emanate with elemental energies.

> In cities, attitude towards primal magic is similar to the way people view arcane magicâ€”it is simply another way to manipulate the forces of the world, that only just so happens to be constrained by nature. However, those living closer to the wilds, in villages or as tribes, understand that nature cannot be commanded, and primal spellcasters must ask, not demand.
> The [[Green Faith]] is strongly associated with primal magic, as are most [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]], [[Fey|fey]], and clerics of natural [[Deity|deities]].
> It is a component of some [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] magic, such as tupilaq fetishes, and of [[Mualijae]] and [[Wildborn|wildborn]] magic.
> Instructors at the [[Magaambya]] teach primal magic, and especially novel methods of combining it with [[Arcane magic|arcane magic]] in the form of halcyon magic. Primal magic is also deployed by Magaambyan Rain-Scribes and Tempest-Sun mages.
> Users of primal magic are welcomed as intermediaries between [[Human|humans]] and [[Fey|fey]] in the [[Fangwood]].


## Practitioners

> The power of nature can be wielded by [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]], some [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]], some [[Witch|witches]] and some [[Summoner|summoners]]. Druids gain their spells from their connection to and deep understanding of nature, sorcerers are born with a natural ability to manipulate the wilds, witches receive their powers from their patrons, and summoners - through the link with their eidolon.
> Druids are especially restricted by their magic, as they have to follow an anathema specific to their order to stay connected to nature.


## Applications

> Certain primal magic [[Ritual|rituals]] produce [[Leshy|leshies]] who can grow to innately wield it.
