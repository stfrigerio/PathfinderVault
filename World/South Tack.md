> The **South Tack** (sometimes known as the **Inner Sea South Tack**) is one of the two major sea trade routes of the [[Inner Sea]]. Like its [[North Tack|northern counterpart]], it runs along the southern coast of the Inner Sea. It begins in [[Katapesh]] and heads north from there to [[Sothis]] in [[Osirion]] before turning west while hugging [[Garund|Garunds]] southern coast all the way through the [[Arch of Aroden]] and into the [[Arcadian Ocean]]. From there it turns south and ends at the [[Rahadoum|Rahadoumi]] capital of [[Azir]].
