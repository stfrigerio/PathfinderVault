> **Jaradisam** is a ruined city that sits in the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]] and is home to a powerful [[Asura rana]]. [[Bohga]], an [[Asura|asura]] of immense power, dwells openly within these ruins, and it is said she ascended after meditating on the wealth stolen from a hundred monasteries left abandoned after [[Kothogaz]]'s rampage across Vudra in [[345 AR]]. Bohga has attracted various monstrous societies to dwell within the ruin but it is said that she still meditates before a colossal pile of treasure and her form itself is that of a woman made of solid [[Gold|gold]] and beautiful [[Gemstone|jewels]].
