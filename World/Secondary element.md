> The **secondary elements** are formed by the mixture of two of the four basic [[Element|elements]]: air, earth, fire, and water. Such secondary elements include:

> - **ice**: combining air and water
> - **lightning**: combining air and, possibly, fire
> - **mud**: combining earth and water
> - **magma**: combining earth and fire
> The mixing of elements is seen, for example, to occur at the borders between the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]]. At these planar borders, [[Elemental|elemental]] creatures and [[Outsider|outsiders]] might also be created from these secondary elements.
> Elements also form at the borders between the Elemental Planes and other adjacent [[Plane|planes]]:

> - **aether**, or **pure force**: combining elements with the [[Ethereal Plane]]. Aether can predominantly be found in [[Ustalav]]'s [[Furrows]], [[Tian Xia]]'s [[Valashmai Jungle]], [[Nar-Voth]]'s [[Court of Ether]], and the [[Mana Wastes]].
> - **metal**
> - **void**: combining elements with the [[Negative Energy Plane]]
> - **wood**: combining elements with the [[First World]]
