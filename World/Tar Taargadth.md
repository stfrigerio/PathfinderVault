![[Taargick.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Taargick, High King of the Dwarves.
> **Tar Taargadth** (pronounced TAHR TAHR-gahdth) was a truly ancient and long-lived [[Dwarf|dwarven]] empire which united the race into a common culture for over 6,500 years.


## History

> Tar Taargadth was founded by the great general [[Taargick]] in [[-5133 AR]] during the dwarves' [[Quest for Sky]]. Arguments and infighting had brought the great drive for the surface of [[Golarion]] to a halt. Taargick consolidated power under him and declared himself king, refocusing his people's attention and completing the drive out of the [[Darklands]] in [[-4987 AR]].
> In the thousands of years that followed, dwarves spread throughout [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]], controlling their territories from [[Sky Citadel|Sky Citadels]] and battling their [[Orc|orc]] and [[Goblinoid|goblinoid]] enemies wherever they found them.  Eventually the power of the Tar Taargadth began to wane due to infighting, and the empire was finally defeated by an overwhelming orc horde in [[1551 AR]]. The Sky Citadels were either overrun by the enemy or so effectively isolated from each other that dwarves began to no longer see themselves as members in a greater empire, a view which exists to this day. The heart of the empire was located in today's [[Five Kings Mountains]], and even though the dwarves still dominate the region today, they no longer have the unity of Tar Taargadth.
