> The matriarchy of **Holomog** is one of the coastal nations of [[GarundSouthern Garund|Southern Garund]], beyond the [[Inner Sea region]]. It is generally considered to be one of the region's two most powerful nations alongside [[Droon]]. Holomog is a nation of warriors and artisans with traditions going back to the time of [[Azlant|Ancient Azlant]], and covers much of [[Garund|Garunds]] south-eastern coast.



## Economy

> One of Holomog's main exports are [[Spice|spices]] from [[Anuli]] that are traded along the Antarkos Sweep trade route.

## History

> After [[Earthfall]], the collection of city-states that would form modern-day Holomog petitioned the [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lords]] for help to survive the destruction and the [[Age of Darkness]] that followed. Incredibly, their petitions worked. [[Mazludeh]] led a coalition of lords from all three celestial planes to form the Celestial Concordance of Holoma Provinces that would protect the people, and establish the government that Holomog continues to have today: the divinely transformed monarch omwas.
> [[Pathfinder ChroniclesVolume 4|Volume 4]] of the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]* describes the visit of legendary [[Pathfinder]] [[Durvin Gest]] and the [[Pirate|pirate]] queen [[Mastrien Slash]] to Holomog. Gest abandoned Slash at the southern cliffs, but she was eventually able to install herself as Holomog's ruler. Under her leadership, Holomog underwent a period of dramatic military expansion, eventually reaching as far as the land of [[Geb's Rest]]. This military expansion came to an end in [[4329 AR]] when the mighty archmage [[Geb (person)|Geb]] turned most of the Holomog army to stone, creating the [[Field of Maidens]].


### Holomog today

> Today, Holomog stands out as a matriarchy that is not [[Evil|evil]], yet still suffers from political intrigue, [[Chaos|chaos]] cults, an evil nation of [[Undead|undead]] on their borders, and 10,000 years worth of abandoned cities and ruins. Holomog is also the only nation on [[Golarion]] that has been continuously exposed to the energies of the [[Outer plane|outer planes]] for millennia, causing a number of unexpected side-effects, including a unique race: the [[Ganzi|ganzi]].
> Recently, rumors have begun to spread that Holomog may once more be preparing for war.


## Inhabitants

> Holomog is home to the largest population of [[Ganzi|ganzi]] due to being bathed in chaotic extraplanar energy for centuries.


## Religion

> The empyreal lord [[Mazludeh]] serves as the patron goddess of Holomog due to her actions after Earthfall, when she formed the Celestial Concordance of Holoma Provinces by leading many of her fellow empyreal lords to protect the nation from the massive devastation.
