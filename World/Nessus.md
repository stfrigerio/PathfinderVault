> **Nessus** (pronounced NEHS-uhs) is [[Hell|Hells]] lowest layer, ruled by the Prince of Darkness, [[Asmodeus]]. Nessus is a desolate wasteland, a place apparently destroyed by [[Volcano|volcanic]] fire, and a land of formless darkness.
> Little is known of this dark place, but it is clear that only the greatest of [[Devil|devils]] are permitted residence here. [[Pit fiend|Pit fiends]] are most common in Nessus, serving in the infernal courts or attending dark councils.
> Strongly suspected are the great wonders and treasures held in the vaults of Asmodeus himself. Powerful [[Artifact|artifacts]] such as the key to [[Rovagug|Rovagugs]] prison and the [[Deity|deity]]-slaying [[Spear|spear]] head, the *[[Ihystear]]*. If rumours can be believed, Asmodeus only keeps relics in preparation for the existence yet to come, in the final stage of his master plan to reorganise the [[Multiverse|multiverse]] to his own liking.
