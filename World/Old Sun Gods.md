> The **Old Sun Gods** are a pantheon of [[Deity|deities]] themed around [[Lion|lions]] and the [[Sun|sun]]. They were nearly forgotten among the people of [[Mzali]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] until the Bright Lions, a resistance group opposed to [[Walkena]] led by Sihar, reintroduced them as a means of spreading discord against Walkena's rule.
