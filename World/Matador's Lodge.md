> The **Matador's Lodge** is a [[Magnimar|Magnimarian]] restaurant and tavern that features entertainment centered around cruelty to [[Animal|animals]]. The spectacle includes [[Cattle|bull]] baiting, [[Cattle|cow]] catching, and [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Horse|horse]] breaking. So dedicated to man's dominance over animals, no vegetarian food is offered in the restaurant. The lodge also sponsors the late summer rodeos popular in the city. A disfigured bull's head is mounted above the bar with a plaque identifying it as the "Felled One". The proprietor, [[Basaalee Minvandu]], is a cruel man, disdainful of others' suffering.
