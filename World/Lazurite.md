> **Lazurite** is a magical ore that can generally only be found in the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Sekamina]]. It is said to either be the body of a dead god, or a decayed [[Radioactive|radioactive]] mineral which no longer exists in its original form.



## Description

> In its natural state, lazurite appears as a thin, black crust within the white rock known as marrowstone. It gives off a strange [[Necromancy|necromantic]] radiation, and any corpses left within a few paces may spontaneously rise as [[Ghoul|ghouls]] or [[Ghast|ghasts]]â€”in some cases retaining the knowledge and skills they possessed in life. Ghouls are attracted to lazurite, as its radiation helps them resist positive energy.
> Even though most natural deposits of lazurite is found in Sekamina, a large strain of it is known to exist in the haunted [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[Zolurket Mines]] in [[Katapesh|Katapeshs]] [[Barrier Wall]] mountains.


## Magical uses

> Lazurite can be used to craft necromantic magical items or traps. Devotees of the [[Whispering Way]] have been known to construct items made of lazurite to help their followers achieve undeath.


### Elementals and constructs

> Ghoul spellcasters have learned how to summon [[Earth elemental|earth elementals]] near large deposits of lazurite, creating powerful allies that give off necromantic magic and bolster nearby undead. Similarly, the ghouls of [[Nemret Noktoria]] have learned how to construct [[Marrowstone golem|marrowstone golems]] carved from lazurite. Their magic not only strengthens nearby undead, but anyone slain by such a golem rises as a free-willed ghould within 24 hours.
