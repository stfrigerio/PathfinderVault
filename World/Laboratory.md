> A **laboratory**, also called a **lab**, is a space that contains specialized crafting and measurement tools for practicing [[Engineering|engineering]] and academic research. Many sensitive crafts and [[Science|sciences]] require such a space, though none more than [[Technology|technological]] construction.

### Technology laboratories

> On [[Golarion]], facilities for building high-tech devices are exceedingly rare and potentially dangerous to access. Such specialized labs not under the control of the [[Technic League]] may be plagued by out-of-control [[Robot|robots]], vengeful or insane [[Android|androids]], disfigured undead, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aberration|aberrations]], or [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligences]]â€”or, worst of all, lack the [[Power supply|power]] necessary to function, rendering them useless. The advanced tools and tremendous amounts of power required by a technological lab also make them impossible to reproduce on Golarion. However, a skilled [[Technologist|technologist]] with access to a lab can potentially invent technological devices with functions that reach beyond even the alien [[Artifact|artifacts]] scattered across [[Numeria]].
> There are six known types of technological labs:

> - **Cybernetics labs**, which can be used to create and implant technology designed to meld with biological systems
> - **Graviton labs**, for the crafting of graviton technology
> - **[[Medicine|Medical]] labs**, for crafting technological healing and enhancement items and pharmaceuticals
> - **Military labs**, which serve as forges for basic technological weapons and armor
> - **Nanotech labs** specialized for crafting such items and systems
> - **Production labs**, which offer general-purpose crafting of basic technological items
> Known technology laboratories include:

> - Many temples of [[Brigh]], which are workshops for technology if not full-fledged, powered technological laboratories.
> - The [[Spaceship|spaceship]] wreckage across [[Numeria]], which contains some intact high-tech laboratories.
