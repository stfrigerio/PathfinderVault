> Many of Absalom's residents organize themselves into one of hundreds of different houses, which are similar to clans organized by national origin. Each house is a political entity that often maintains a strong connection to its homeland. They grant a set number of minor titles, and are governed by a lord known as a Scion. The immediate descendants of titleholders are automatically enrolled in the house, but not granted the title. Members of a house usually use the house name in place of a surname, while those without a house may use a place of birth, a nickname, or the title "of Gyr" to indicate loyalty to the primarch.
