> The **Salt Market**, despite its misleading name, mainly deals in building supplies and it is the first port of call for [[Kintargo|Kintargos]] architects and builders. Its location in [[Old Kintargo]] just inside the [[Salt Gate]] gives it easy access to the [[Yolubilis River]] from which much of its goods are delivered.
