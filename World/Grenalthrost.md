> **Grenalthrost**, or the **Great Bridge of [[Grenalf]]**, is a massive [[Cyclopes|cyclopean]] bridge that spans a great crevasse in [[Iobaria|Iobiarias]] [[Syrzemyan Highlands]], allowing access to the [[Grenalf Plateau]] and the city of [[Kirya]]. The Great Bridge is one of the most treacherous portions of the [[Koloran roads]], as many of its nefarious mechanical traps are still active, continuing to claim lives thousands of years after the fall of the [[Koloran Empire]].
