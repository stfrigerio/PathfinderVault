> The **Twins' Gate** is the name given to two separate gates in the city wall of [[Magnimar]] that allow visitors access to [[Grand Arch]] district and the rest of the [[Summit Magnimar district|Summit]] region of the city. The gates are named for the twins [[Cailyn Vanderale|Cailyn]] and [[Romre Vanderale]] who helped saved the city from an attack of monstrous creatures that had been imprisoned within the [[Irespan]]. A statue dedicated to the twin saviours of Magnimar, called [[Guardians arch|the Guardians]], is located very close to the gates; the shape of this statue gives the Grand Arch district its name.
