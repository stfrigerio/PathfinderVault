> **Orostgard** is a forest in [[Iobaria|Iobarias]] [[Syrzemyan Highlands]], located to the east of the temple city of [[Kirya]]. After [[Human|humans]] settled in Kirya, Orostgard was logged to build new structures, but centuries of deforestation exposed something that resulted in the death of Kirya's entire human population in [[1574 AR]].
