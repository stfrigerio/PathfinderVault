> The **Mudpot** is a region of [[Nirmathas]] near the source of the [[Deepcut River]] in the [[Mindspin Mountains]]. Characterized by the large hot springs that bubble throughout it, the Mudpot is largely avoided by [[Humanoid|humanoids]] due to the population of [[Ooze|oozes]] and [[Elemental|elementals]] that reside here. Those that do brave the Mudpot are attracted by the rare [[Alchemical substances|alchemical agents]] and [[Gemstone|gemstones]] that are created by the [[Volcanic|volcanic]] activity in the region.
