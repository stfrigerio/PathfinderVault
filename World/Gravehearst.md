> **Gravehearst** was a town in the [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarian]] kingdom of [[Sarkoris]]. During the [[Mendevian CrusadesFirst Mendevian Crusade|First Mendevian Crusade]] it was attacked by an overwhelming force of [[Demon|demons]] from the [[Worldwound]]. The local [[Shamanism|shamans]] had created a powerful [[Magic item|magic item]] to defend the town against the demons, but found themselves unable to activate it.
> Also in the town at that time was a force of crusaders led by [[Clydwell|Saint Clydwell]]. The shamans gave him the item to guard. Saint Clydwell died fighting a powerful demon, but his death created a powerful magical effect which banished all the demons from the town and also empowered the magic item, creating the *[[Demonscope]]*. Unfortunately for the people of Gravehearst, the banishing of the demons was only temporary.
