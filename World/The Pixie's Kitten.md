> Located on the corner of Salmon Street and Razor Street in [[Sandpoint]], the **Pixie's Kitten** is the town's brothel. Owned and run by [[Kaye Tesarani]], it is generally a distinguished and well-run establishment which offers generously compensated women and men for the townfolk's more carnal needs. The brothel employs three large [[Shoanti human ethnicity|Shoanti]] men as bodyguards and bouncers who generally have no problem keeping the peace and dealing with malcontents. [[Jubrayl Vhiski]], the head of the local gang of [[Sczarni]], has been trying to get prostitution outlawed in Sandpoint for years, in order to move in on her business, but Kaye's relationship with [[Belor Hemlock|Sheriff Belor Hemlock]] has so far prevented this.
