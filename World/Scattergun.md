> A large example of the [[World/Items & Equipment/Weapons/Guns/Blunderbuss|blunderbuss]] family of [[Firearm|firearms]], a scattergun fires a blast of [[Lead|lead]] shot that can be quite ruinous at close range. The size difference also means that the 8-pound scattergun costs more than its smaller cousin. Unlike the blunderbuss, its operator needs both hands free to be able to use the scattergun, but the chance for a misfire has been corrected.
