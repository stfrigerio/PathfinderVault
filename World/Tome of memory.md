 A procession of Aroden's followers, one of whom is holding a *Tome of Memory*.
> ***Tomes of Memory*** are liturgical texts belonging to the clergy of the god [[Aroden]]. Each *Tome* included homilies and aphorisms supposedly spoken by Aroden. Each temple of Aroden housed at least one *Tome of Memory*, the cover of which was typically made from brass. The back pages of *Tomes of Memory* included blank pages in which the temple's clergy members would inscribe the history of their temple and record details of relevant local legends, mysteries, and treasures. Since Aroden's death, most *Tomes* have gone missing.
