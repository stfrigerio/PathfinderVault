![[Akiton_gate.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Travelers from [[Golarion]] step foot on [[Akiton]], a distant [[Planet|planet]].
> Traversing the vast reaches of the [[Material Plane]] past the [[Gravity|gravitational]] bonds of a [[Planet|planet]] is no small task, but inhabitants of a few worlds—including [[Golarion]]—have achieved **space travel**, whether by [[Spell|spell]], [[Spaceship|spaceship]], a combination of the two, or other mysterious means.



## On Golarion

> Golarion's peoples have not developed the [[Technology|technological capacity]] to leave Golarion, but some have deployed powerful—if unstable—magical transports.

> - The *[[Lirgen's Glory|Lirgens Glory]]* used a bound [[Vrock|vrock]] to power its flight from [[Oagon]], [[Lirgen]], into space.
> - An [[Arcane engine|arcane engine]] in [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Forests/Fangwood]] once powered a highly specific *tree step* spell designed for interplanetary travel.
> - A number of [[Portal|portals]] on Golarion can teleport people to other planets.
> Golarion also occasionally receives visitors from space, including the tremendous crash of the *[[Divinity]]* in the [[Rain of Stars]] over [[Numeria]].


### Challenges of space travel from Golarion

> Most [[Teleportation|teleportation]] spells are incapable of transporting creatures from Golarion to any other planetary body, including its own [[Somal|moon]]. Very specific and powerful spells, such as *interplanetary teleport*, remain the most accessible methods for those with the means to cast or commission them.
> Portals to other worlds are often keyed, limiting access to those who know their location and understand their purpose.
> Physically traversing space itself presents numerous additional challenges. Space is a hostile environment; the void's frigid vacuum can suffocate or freeze unadapted and unprotected travelers within seconds, gravitational forces (or the lack thereof) can make controlling one's movement difficult or outright rip creatures apart, and the vast distances between worlds require extraordinary speed to reach even the nearest destinations in anything less than a matter of years.
> Prospective space travelers could tame wild space-native [[Shantak|shantaks]] visiting Golarion, taking advantage of their speed and ability to protect their riders from the hazards of space. Certain magical items, such as a *necklace of adaptation*, can also protect space travelers. [[Androffan]] technology recovered from [[Numeria]] can also provide such protective effects, though the [[Technic League]] controls much of the *Divinity* wreckage's functional items, and millennia-old salvage might be unreliable and difficult or impossible to repair.


### Space travel via coterminous planes

> As both the [[Shadow Plane]] and the [[First World]] are coterminous with the [[Material Plane]] (*i.e.*, each point on the Shadow Plane corresponds to one on the Material Plane), it is theoretically possible to travel through them to other planets within Golarion's [[Solar system|solar system]]. This would be accomplished by entering one of these [[Plane|planes]] from Golarion, traveling through it, and then exiting at a point that corresponded with another planet. The benefit of this would be that the traveler could avoid moving through the void between the planets, but the downsides are also considerable. Traveling through the Shadow Plane is not without its risks, and would still involve bridging the vast distances between the planets. Travel through the First World is highly unpredictable, as the plane's geography is constantly shifting, and could deposit a traveler exiting the plane in the void of space or within a [[Star|star]] just as easily.


## Elsewhere in the Material Plane

> - The planet [[Apostae]] might also be a spaceship of unknown origin.
> - Elements of the [[Dominion of the Black]] are capable of space travel, such as the organic spaceships piloted by [[Shipmind|shipminds]].
> - Several worlds, including [[Androffa]], [[Brethedan]], [[Eox]], and [[Verces]], have or once had [[SpaceshipTypes of spaceship|spaceships]] capable of space travel.
