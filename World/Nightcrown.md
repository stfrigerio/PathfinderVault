> **Nightcrown** is one of the three neighbourhoods (along with [[The Cradle Vyre|The Cradle]] and [[Sanctuary Vyre|Sanctuary]]) that make up the district of [[Bliss]] in the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Vyre]]. The districts of Bliss are what most people are thinking of when they imagine the sin-soaked City of Masks. Nightcrown is home to the notorious [[Opal Market]] where all sort of outlandish bargains can be struck and the market is overlooked by [[Cobweb Manor]] which is home to one of Vyre's rulers, the so-called [[Manticce Kaleekii|Queen of Delights]].
