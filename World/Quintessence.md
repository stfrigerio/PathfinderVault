> **Quintessence** is the [[Alignment|aligned]] substance that forms the [[Outer Plane|Outer Planes]].



## On the Material Plane

> Quintessence can take any form on the [[Material Plane]] and appear alive, if without inherent intelligence.


## Component of outsiders

*See also: [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner]] and [[Outsider|outsider]]*
> When merged with a [[Soul|soul]], a [[Plane|planes]] quintessence assumes that soul's alignment and creates an [[Outsider|outsider]]. Most become [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] of a specific plane after judgment and assignment by [[Pharasma]], taking a form consistent with that plane's templates. Souls particularly attuned to a plane become more specific types of outsiders related to the plane.


## Dissolution

*See also: [[Potentiality]]*
> Upon any outsider's destruction, its aligned quintessence—along with its compiled knowledge and beliefs—is absorbed into its home plane, or often into other planes if destroyed away from its home plane. Quintessence is perpetually disintegrated from the planes by the [[Maelstrom]] to become [[Unaligned|unaligned]] [[Potentiality|potentiality]], at which point it is funneled to the Antipode and redirected to the [[Inner Plane|Inner Planes]]. In the [[Positive Energy Plane]], potentiality becomes part of the source matter of new souls.
