> **Neutral** is an [[Alignment|alignment]] with multiple meanings, not all of which may apply to an individual. It is most commonly associated with those who do not have any particular moral inclinations, and is sometimes referred to as **true neutrality**.

> Neutral characters cannot be represented by one specific outlook; there are several reasons a person may be considered neutral. Neutral is the default for those who have not taken a moral or ethical stance in any direction, neither good or evil nor lawful or chaotic. This also includes non-sentient animals that have no capacity to choose and primarily follow their primitive, amoral instincts. Those who have chosen to enforce a "natural balance" between all the other ethics are also considered neutral. These often include those who worship the perfect balance of nature, particularly [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]]. Those who have the 'natural balance' enforced upon them may feel differently about the neutrality of such people, perhaps deriding them as evil. Neutral is also the alignment for those who seek a centered existence, with moderation in all things; ascetics who take no side and instead seek spiritual perfection of the self are an excellent example of this.


## Gods

> One of the best examples of a neutral [[Deity|deity]] is [[Gozreh]], a deity who balances nature's nurturing side with its more destructive forces. If Gozreh embodied just one of these aspects he would probably fall under a different alignment; because he represents the two in perfect balance, he is considered neutral.
