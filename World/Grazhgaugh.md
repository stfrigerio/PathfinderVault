> **Grazhgaugh** is one particularly powerful [[Manticore|manticore]] living in a copse of [[Paueliel|paueliel trees]] near [[Darkmoon Wood]]'s Forest Elder. It is chasing away or eating any creature larger than a squirrel that dares approach his domain. Rumor has it guards some [[Elf|elven]] artifact hidden among the tall silver-barked paueliel trees.
