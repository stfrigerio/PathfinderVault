> **Tzaarban** once served as the capital of the ancient [[Cyclops|cyclops]] civilisation of [[Ghol-Gan]] but now lies sunken beneath the waves of the [[Arcadian Ocean]]. At its height, during the Ghol-Gan classical era, Tzaarban is believed to have housed as many inhabitants as modern-day [[Sothis]], but it has been abandoned for millennia. The city once stood amidst the heartland of ancient Ghol-Gan but, with [[Earthfall]], the city and much of the debased kingdom surrounding it sank beneath the Arcadian Ocean. Tzaarban now lies submerged somewhere north-west of [[Tempest Cay]] on the ocean floor near the isles of [[Shackles|the Shackles]].
