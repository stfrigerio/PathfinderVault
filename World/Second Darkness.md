“

A strange shadow lurks in the sky above the city of [[Riddleport]], and the doomsayers take it as a sign of the approaching end of the world.
> The thing is—they're right. But the source of the menace facing [[Golarion]] comes not from the skies above, but the [[Darklands]] below. The Second Darkness Adventure Path takes heroes on a sweeping quest that begins in a star-struck city, weaves through ancient [[Elf|elven]] ruins, and unmasks the terrible secret of the subterranean [[Drow|dark elves]]!

A foul omen looms over the city of [[Riddleport]]. What could the dark blot over the city of swindlers and thieves mean? Apocalyptic whispers fill the street, priests search for signs from their gods, and rumours of strange happenings shake the city. Could this ominous portent be the work of a scheming crimeboss, mysterious [[Cyphermage|cyphermages]], or a petty pirate lord? Or does it prophesize some new menace come to [[Golarion]]? A step into Riddleport's high-stakes underworld of sin and debauchery reveals that not all in the pirate's paradise is as it seems. Only PCs can foil a terrible new plot that reaches from below to take hold of Varisia's city of sin.

The city of [[Celwynvian]] hides a terrible sin.

But as a new power rises in the depths, the elves' secret threatens not only to escape, but to rain down devastation upon the entire world. In desperation, elven eyes fall to a band of outsiders for aid. Tread the forsaken ground of Celwynvian, once one of the greatest capitals of elven culture, now a graveyard haunted by the spirits of the past, foul dragons, demons, and worse. Discover the darkest secret of the Mierani Forest and the truth of the cataclysm known as [[Earthfall]]. And dare to shed the bonds of eternity and pay witness to an apocalypse that has borne out a thousand times and threatens to devastate Golarion once more!

***[[Endless Night]]***

**Written by** [[F Wesley Schneider]]

**Released** November 2008


Far below the world of light, a cavity of unspeakable evil spreads an ancient hatred through the darkness. From their city of [[Zirnakaynin]] the [[Drow|dark elves]] rule an empire of lies and dark magic. Already their foul ambitions grasp for the world above, threatening a cataclysm beyond reckoning and the advent of a second [[Age of Darkness]]. Only by taking on the disguises of dark elves themselves and invading the capital of the drow can the PCs discover their enemies' true faces and put an end to their world-shattering plot. But what hope for survival can natives of the surface have in a merciless realm of endless night?

***[[A Memory of Darkness]]***

**Written by** [[JD Wiker]]

**Released** December 2008


With the end of everything looming among the stars, the time has come for decisive action among the races of the surface world. But old prejudices die hard, and not all in the elven nation of [[Kyonin]] believe the dire portents of doom from the heavens. Among the stoic court of the [[Telandia Edasseril|queen of the elves]], lies and schemes run rampant, and some would rather see a second Age of Darkness than the revelation of their conspiracies. Can the PCs root out the corruption that festers inside the elven homeland and dare the demon-haunted forest that shelters a secret now threatening to destroy the entire world?

***[[Descent into Midnight]]***

**Written by** [[Brian Cortijo]]

**Released** January 2009


In the depths of the earth, in a realm distant from the lands of light, the drow recite the final incantations necessary to bring about the end of the hated surface world. Their enemies lie defeated, and no nation rises to thwart them. Only a small band of unlikely saviors stands against the dark elves' apocalyptic plan. Braving the ageless and accursed [[Land of Black Blood]]—an entire world within the world—the PCs have but a single chance to shatter the spell that threatens to throw all of Golarion into a Second Age of Darkness. But in the face of drow, demons, and terrors long banished to the depths of the earth, can there actually be any hope for victory, or is the end truly at hand?
