> **Whiteshaw** serves as the fortress-like home of [[Caliphas city|Caliphass]] [[Department of Constables and Investigators]], the city's *de facto* police force. Whiteshaw sits at the corner of [[White Avenue]] and Shaw Street in the north of the city and is surrounded by stone walls.
> The Department of Constables and Investigators is led by the brusque, veteran [[Boverde Hoptler|Captain Boverde Hoptler]] and officially he is responsible for all that goes on within Whiteshaw. However, the mysterious [[Bureau of Special Affairs]], also housed within Whiteshaw, functions independently. Under the command of [[Mirakas Vashalnt]], the Bureau answers to no one except [[Aduard Ordranti III|Prince Aduard Ordranti III]] via his advisor [[Diauden]].
