 Lem does not need a festival to celebrate, but it sure helps.
> Countless **holidays and festivals** are celebrated throughout [[Golarion]]. They commemorate a famous occurrence in local history, honor a [[Deity|god or goddess]], celebrate a change in seasons, or are so incredibly old that everyone has forgotten their origin. Below is a short listing of the most famous festivals organized by the [[Absalom ReckoningMonths of the year|month of the year]] in which they occur. Some happen on a specific calendar day each year, while others are a bit more flexible. If the holiday is only celebrated in a certain part of the world, or dedicated to a particular deity, that is listed as well in brackets. If there is no geographical indicator, it means that it is observed more widely.
> When the dates below rely on [[Solstice|solstices]], [[Equinox|equinoxes]], and other phenomena dependent on hemisphere, this list assumes the northern hemisphere unless otherwise noted.
