> **Southmarket** is one of two neighbourhoods that make up the waterfront district known [[Vise|the Vise]]. It is supposedly named the Vise because it is where most newcomers to [[Vyre]] arrive, thus it is where the city gets hold of them and never releases its grip. Southmarket contains a lot of Vyre's infrastructure, as well as a large number of hostels, inns, and taverns, including the prestigious hostel [[Dancing Cat|the Dancing Cat]]. The district's various establishments boast numerous "Reputation Watchers", local guides who offer to help ensure visitors maintain the anonymity the city is so renowned for.
