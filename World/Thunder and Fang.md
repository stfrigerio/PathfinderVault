> **Thunder and Fang** is one of several unique fighting styles utilized by the people of the [[Storval Plateau]], developed to help the [[Shoanti]] survive in the harsh environment they call home. This method of two-weapon combat utilizes an [[Earth breaker|earth breaker]] and [[Klar|klar]] to increased effectiveness, enabling one to bring to bear the blows of the Shoanti heavy hammer and slashes of the bladed klar without sacrificing the defense they afford the warrior.
