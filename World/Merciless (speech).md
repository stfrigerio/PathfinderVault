 Daidian Ruel.
*This article is about the speech by [[Daidian Ruel]]. For the [[Ship|ship]] involved in the Siege of Endrin Isle, see *[[Merciless]]*.*
> **"Merciless"** was the name given to a moving speech by [[Daidian Ruel]] to the court of [[Gaspodar|King Gaspodar]] of [[Cheliax]] in [[Sarenith]] of [[4576 AR]]. The speech not only won Ruel a royal pardon from his vigilante crimes, it also led to the founding of the [[Hellknights]], particularly Ruel's precursor to the [[Order of the Rack]].


## History

> Within hours of his arrest in Sarenith of 4576 AR for leading a posse of vigilantes that hunted cultists of the [[Path of Grace]] during the [[White Plague]], Daidian Ruel's compatriots had broken him out of prison—against his own orders—and fled to [[Fort Rivad]], then a [[Taldor|Taldan]] ruin. He subsequently returned to Westcrown and gave this impassioned speech indicting Cheliax's inaction against corruption and [[Chaos|chaos]] before King Gaspodar, who was so moved that he pardoned Ruel and commissioned him to form a new [[Knight|knightly]] order. This order soon became the foundation of the Hellknights, and "Merciless" remains one of the Hellknights' most important [[Philosophy|philosophical]] texts.


> Excerpts from "Merciless" appear in *[[What Lies in Dust]]* p. 61 and *[[Path of the Hellknight]]* p. 2.
