> The **Horsemen of the Velashu Uplands**, also known as **Velashu Horse Lords** or, simply, the **Horselords**, are a group of rugged [[PathfinderWiki/Ranger|rangers]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]] who roam the lands north of [[Riddleport]].
> The Horselords mostly consist of [[Ulfen]] warriors who came south to [[Varisia]] in search of a more peaceful existence. Over the generations, they mixed with local [[Varisian|Varisians]], and even the occasional [[Shoanti]]. The Shoanti influence has given them the colloquial name of the "Eighth Quah" despite the fact they are not a true Shoanti tribe.
> Traveling in nomadic tribes, the Horselords follow the vast herds of wild [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Horse|horses]]. They are renowned for being fine riders and horse breeders, and often travel to settlements such as [[Riddleport]] to sell or trade these animals. However, they vet all prospective buyers to ensure they are suitable owners, and if they do agree to sell they require the new owner to promise never to sell or give away the horse to anyone else.
> Their location in north-west Varisia often puts them in conflict with the far more vicious Noland Raiders to the north. However, they are usually on reasonable terms with the [[Elf|elves]] of the nearby [[Mierani Forest]].
