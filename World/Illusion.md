> **Illusion** is one of the eight [[Schools of magic|schools of magic]] practiced on [[Golarion]]. It deals with the creation of images, sounds, figments, or shadows, generally to confuse or deceive the onlooker. [[Wizard|Wizards]] who specialize in this form of [[Magic|magic]] are known as **illusionists**.


## On Golarion

*See also: [[CategoryIllusionists]]*
> The lesser-known [[God|goddess]] [[Sivanah]], also known as the Seventh Veil, is considered the patron deity of illusion magics, using it to cleverly conceal her own appearance under layers of obfuscation. Illusionists can be found as priests of her church, although those with different personal or philosophical outlooks can also be found among the clergy of [[Calistria]] or [[Norgorber]].
> [[Shadow magic]] is considered a subschool of illusion magic.


### Sin magic

***Main article: [[Sin magic]]***
> During the reign of the [[Runelords|runelords]] of ancient [[Thassilon]], illusion was associated with the sin of pride, and was therefore the specialty of [[Xanderghul]], ruler of [[Cyrusian]].
