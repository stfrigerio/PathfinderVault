> The **Iudeimus Tenement** is one of the numerous high-stacked tenement buildings that still litter [[Old Kintargo]] and house many of [[Kintargo|Kintargos]] poorer working-class residents. Like many such tenement buildings, it is run by a thoroughly disreputable manager, the hateful old crone [[Nurla Botve]]. The building is one of the taller ones in Old Kintargo; it is well built, with its bottom floor made of stone, whilst its top two floors are wooden.
