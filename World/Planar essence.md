> **Planar essence**, synonymous with **planar energy** or **planar power**, is the essential substance and energy of a [[Plane|plane]]. Many kinds of planar abilities, creatures, and practices find ways to harness or infuse planar essence.
> The form and content of planar essence varies wildly between planes based on their [[Alignment|alignment]] or [[Element|element]], and while it sometimes can be extracted or distilled from planar matter with material manifestations or effects, it can also be abstract in nature. For example, the essence of [[Elysium]] can be the spirit of cooperation.
