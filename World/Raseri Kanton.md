> **Raseri Kanton** in the [[Five Kings Mountains]] was the sister city of [[Jernashall]]. [[Khadon|Khadon the Mighty]] founded the empire of [[Tar Khadurrm]] in [[3'9 AR]] and the city of [[Jernashall]] in [[3312 AR]]. Jernashall became the preeminent city of the new empire, although [[Highhelm Militia]] remained its capital. Jernashall became so important that the nations of [[Cheliax]] and [[Isger]] petitioned it to help them build a surface city close to it. With the help of the dwarves, the city of Raseri Kanton was founded in [[3451 AR]], and became a vital trade center in the region.
> For 500 years, Tar Khadurrm and its cities flourished, until the [[Rending|Rending of Droskars Crag]] in [[3980 AR|3980  AR]]. The seismic and volcanic event destroyed [[Jernashall]] and its sister city of Raseri Kanton. In Jernashall, a river of lava killed every citizen within minutes. The fate of Raseri Kanton was just as horrifying: the whole city fell into the earth.
