> A **weapon**, sometimes called an **arm** or **armament**, is an instrument used to inflict harm. While some weapons are improvised and others are repurposed from common tools or devices, most are designed to inflict damage to beings and structures.



## Classes of weapons

> Weapons can be classified in a number of ways:

### By range

*See also: [[CategoryWeapons by range]] and [[CategoryAmmunition]]*
> Weapons can be designed for up-close melee combat, such as swords and maces; to reach targets within a short range, such as polearms; or to attack targets at a greater distance, such as bows and thrown weapons.


### By required skill

*See also: [[CategoryWeapons by skill level]]*
> Many weapons can be simple to use, if not master. Some, however, require martial training or extensive perfection of exotic or esoteric techniques.

### By weight and grip

*See also: [[CategoryWeapons by grip]]*
> Light weapons can be easily wielded, while other one-handed weapons require more concentration, and two-handed weapons work best in the grip of a strong wielder. These scales can be relative to the wielder; a weapon usable in one hand by a [[Human|human]] might require two when wielded by a [[Halfling|halfling]], for example.


### By damage

*See also: [[CategoryWeapons by damage type]]*
> There are many ways a weapon can harm a target. Bladed weapons cut and slash, pointed weapons pierce, and blunt weapons bludgeon. Many weapons can do some or all of these types of damage depending on how they're wielded, but most are designed to focus on a specific type of harm.


### By scale

*See also: [[CategorySiege engines]]*
> Weapons are not limited to what [[Humanoid|humanoids]] can hold in their hands. Larger weapons, such as [[Siege engine|siege engines]] and cannons, might require crews to operate but can also operate with a greater magnitude of destructive force.


### By technological level

*See also: [[Technology]] and [[CategoryTechnological weapons]]*
> In their most basic forms, many weapons are little more than highly refined arrangements of metal, wood, stone, and other simple materials. Others employ more complex mechanical, chemical, electrical, or other [[Technology|technological]] processes.
> The most prominent example of a technological weapon on [[Golarion]] is the [[Firearm|firearm]], a weapon rarely found outside of [[Alkenstar]] that combines mechanics with explosive chemistry to fire projectiles at devastating rates of speed. Also, [[Androffa|alien]] technology scattered across [[Numeria]] is capable of all manner of strange effects and destructive potential.


### By magical enhancement

*See also: [[Magic item]] and [[CategoryMagic weapons]]*
> The vast majority of weapons on Golarion are considered mundane in nature, but a few are persistently enhanced with [[Magic|magic]]. Whether infused by a spellcaster, a [[Soul|soul]], its environment, a [[Deity|deity]], or other often strange and unnatural means, even a relatively innocuous type of weapon can become exponentially more effective as a **magic weapon**.


### By material

*See also: [[CategoryWeapons by material]]*
> Weapons can be constructed using many materials. Most are made of common, mundane materials, such as wood and steel. Less common are those made of materials with unique or magical properties—such as [[Skymetal|skymetals]], [[Cold iron|cold iron]], and [[Darkwood|darkwood]]—or through special techniques, such as fire- and frost-forged metals.


## On Golarion
