> The **Old City** sits at the very heart of [[Ular Kel]] within its original city walls and nestled within the shadows of the [[Water Houses]] and the [[Water Lord Ular Kel|Water Lords]] who rule the city. The world-famous bazaar of [[The Crossway]] sits within the district, the beating heart of the city, while nobles and sycophants vie for the favour of the Water Lords and the privilege of living within the Old City. This is not just a matter of status but of survival: on several occasions during Ular Kel's history the Water Lords have closed the gates to the Old City, protecting their most dedicated retainers and leaving the rest of the city to be ravaged by [[Disease|disease]], fire, or riots.
