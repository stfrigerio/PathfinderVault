> When a [[Vegepygmy|vegepygmy]] is subjected to [[Drow|drow]] [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]], the resulting creature is known as a **Halsora**.
> Unlike some other fleshwarped creatures, the Halsora appears very similar to the "base" creature. Their eyes are the main exception, being replaced by a constantly flowing water duct that gives the creatures their nickname of "weeping beasts".
