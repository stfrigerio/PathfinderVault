> The **lawful evil** [[Alignment|alignment]] is the realm of those who know what they want and will manipulate the system (legal, cultural, and so forth) to achieve those ends, no matter the consequence. This can be for personal gain (for example, an [[Evil|evil]] vizier who seeks to claim the kingdom for himself) or to better society at all costs—an "I know what's best for everyone else"-attitude without any of the compassionate limits to action found in [[Lawful good|lawful good]].



## Characters

> [[Law|Lawful]] evil characters run the gamut of malicious order, from [[Abrogail Thrune II|diabolical queens]] to [[Valtius|mercenaries]], and from [[Thuldrin Kreed|corporate kingpins]] to [[Zarta Dralneen|devious librarians]]. They thrive on discipline, punishment, and subjugating others, and are willing to sacrifice anything—and anyone—to achieve their goals, though without resorting to messy [[Chaos|chaos]].


## Gods

> [[Asmodeus]] is probably the best example of a lawful evil [[Deity|deity]]. This diabolic tyrant believes only in his uncompromising vision of the [[Great Beyond|multi-verse]] and shows no mercy to those who do not bow to him. The other major lawful evil deity is [[Zon-Kuthon]], a sadist who believes in purging the flesh through pain. A host of [[Archdevil|archdevils]] and [[Infernal duke|infernal dukes]] and foul [[Whore queen|whore queens]] also serve as lawful evil divine entities that can grant spells to their followers.


## Outsiders

> The most famous lawful evil [[Outsider|outsiders]] are known as [[Devil|devils]], foul creatures that want to hold dominion over the entire multi-verse.
> Other lawful evil outsiders include [[Asura|asuras]], [[Velstrac|velstracs]], [[Oni|oni]] and [[Rakshasa|rakshasas]].
