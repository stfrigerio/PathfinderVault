> [[Roper|Ropers]] live in ice caves in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. They are known locally as the **Takers in the Ice**, a name which refers to them being blamed for the disappearance of children and young warriors. These abductees sometimes return years after their disappearance, crawling back with few remaining wits or limbs
> Although ropers are present in the region, they do not kidnap people from [[Irrisen]]. Rumors speculate that this reticence is due to a pact with [[Ice troll|ice trolls]], or it may be due to fear of [[Baba Yaga]] and her daughters.
