 Nethys's Holy Symbol
> ***The Book of Magic*** is the primary holy text of [[Nethys]], the god of [[Magic|magic]] and the official text of his church.
> It is a comprehensive guide for learning and harnessing magic and the ramifications of its use and misuse. The book is full of contradictions. It may act as a primer for an acolyte [[Wizard|wizard]], but if its metaphors and codicils were taken as a guide to morality, the result would a confused and fractured.
> Due to the countless contradictions within the text, most churches of Nethys adapt the set of ideals they find most convenient.
