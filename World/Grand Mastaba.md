 The Grand Mastaba is clearly seen as the black pyramidal structure in the middle of this picture of the city of Korvosa.
> The **Grand Mastaba** is the flat-topped pyramid in the heart of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]], atop which stands [[Castle Korvosa]], home of the city's monarchy. It predates the city by approximately 10,000 years, as it was originally part of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] city of [[Xin-Eurythnia]]. Before becoming the center of political authority for the contemporary city-state of Korvosa, it was settled by the [[Sklar-Quah]] Tribe of [[Shoanti]]. They knew the place as *Mashka-saht-puyuhoke*. Since that time, one side of the pyramid has been damaged for use in city construction, a practice later banned by [[Eodred Arabasti I|Eodred I]]. Deep beneath the pyramid, [[Sorshen]], the [[Runelords|Runelord]] of Lust, once had arcane laboratories and her crypt. There are rumors that she still sleeps there.
