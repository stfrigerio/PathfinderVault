> The **Gutblood Labyrinth** lies in the [[Rechiend's Plains|Rechiends Plains]] in a section of mostly featureless grassland west of [[Free Station]]. The Labyrinth lies beneath a fissure that occurs so abruptly many an unwary traveller has nearly fallen into it. It is so treacherous that the locals know it as "[[Calistria]]'s Grin". Those brave enough to descend into the fissure find nothing for hundreds of feet until reaching depths where the [[Sun|sun]] is but a memory. In its deepest reaches, a series of disconnected caverns now dot both sides of the fissure and wind off in every direction for miles. Though once part of the region of the [[Nar-Voth]] known as the [[Reguare|Sleepless Realm of Reguare]], the Gutblood Labyrinth was cut off from the wider region, though why no one can say. The only hint at what the ancient [[Ghol-Gan|Ghol-Gani]] [[Cyclopes|cyclopes]] may have been trying to contain lies in the bodies of those who try to explore the Gutblood Labyrinth's depths. Their corpses inevitably wash up along the coast of the [[Fever Sea]], bloated and mutilated almost beyond recognition.
