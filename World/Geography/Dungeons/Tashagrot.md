> The **ruins of Tashagrot** are all that remains of the capital of the former [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of Rimetusk, wiped out by predators coming from the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] that were eager to regain their old territories. It is said that the site, which lies on the eastern bank of the [[Gullik River]] south of [[Coldwater]], is infested with the [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] of massacred residents.


## History

> Tashagrot was founded in [[4155 AR]] as part of the spoils Irrisen claimed from the Realm of the Mammoth Lords during the [[Great Eastern War]]. It became the seat of a new province named Rimetusk.
> However, Tashagrot's existence was short-lived. In a short war known as Desna's Vengeance, an enormous force from the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, under the command of a priest of [[Desna]] named Anok, drove the Irriseni occupiers back across the Gullik River. Irrisen lost all of the territory it had gained, and the raiders razed Tashagrot. The supernatural winter that had overtaken the land vanished along with its occupiers.
