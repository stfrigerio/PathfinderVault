Location of the Ruins of Kho in the [[Barrier Wall]] mountain range.
> The **ruins of Kho** were once the first flying city of the [[Shory Empire]]. Located in the [[Kho-Rarne Pass]] of the [[Barrier Wall|Barrier Wall Mountains]] between the [[Mwangi Expanse]] and [[Osirion]], the former Shory capital fell to earth millennia ago.



## History

> Kho was once a true wonder to behold, held aloft by [[Aeromantic Infadibulum|magical engines]] that carried it through the skies. Steered by the whim of the Shory, the city was a utopian blending of [[Technology|technology]] and [[Magic|magic]].
> In [[-632 AR]], Kho was attacked by the [[Spawn of Rovagug]] known as the [[Tarrasque]], who caused the city to come crashing down into the Barrier Wall Mountains before finally coming to rest on its side in a narrow canyon. The few survivors quickly fled into the jungle and perished, taking the mysteries of their mystical homeland to their graves.

Exploring the Ruins of Kho

> Today, Kho is a strange and disturbing place that howls with the dying sputters of unknown magics. Those [[Mwangi]] spellcasters who possess the ability to tap into the latent spiritual energies of Mwangi ruins say that the ruins of Kho are the most potent of all the Expanse's many ruins. Most who seek to plunder the ruins do not survive the attempt, and those who do are plagued by bad luck, with most dying within a couple of years. Evidence of the Tarrasque attack can still be seen on some of the larger ruins, in the form of huge claw marks.
> Several [[Uomoto]] villages can be found near the ruins, their inhabitants nearly indistinguishable from the other lowland Mwangi tribes. The unusually high percentage of [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Adept|adepts]] and [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]] claim their powers come from the ruined city. Although approaching Kho carries a high cultural taboo for these people, they can occasionally be convinced to lead strangers there.
