> The **Necropolis of the Faithful**, on the western bank of the [[Crimson Canal]] in [[Sothis]], [[Osirion]], is a large necropolis of limestone and granite that is one of [[Garund]]'s oldest places of burial, built on the original grounds of the [[High Temple of Pharasma Sothis|High Temple of Pharasma]]. Rather than being a haunted prison for the [[Undead|undead]], the area is a place for the living to come to pay their respects to the deceased. Clerics of [[Pharasma]], led by high priest [[Inebni Andabar]] maintain the grounds. The temple closes its gates at dusk, ceding the grounds to mysterious, shadowy figures.
> The Necropolis includes secret burial chambers dubbed the [[Contemptible Crypts]], which were once used by Osirian royalty.
