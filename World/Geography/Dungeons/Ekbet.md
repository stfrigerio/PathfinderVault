## History

> Ekbet was constructed in -3290 AR near the headwaters of [[Junira]]. A holy site in Osirion's First Age, the gleaming city of temples and rune-carved towers, was guarded by the sphinxes. The sphinxes animated temple statues by affixing sacred *ka stones* to each statue's brow. The animated statues, known as living monoliths, defended the city well for almost two centuries, until a pair of earthquakes ruined Ekbet in [[-3115 AR]]. The city was abandoned for millennia and only a few surviving guardian monoliths patrolled the ruins even though the major temples had been swallowed up by the earth.


## Inhabitants

> The ruin's current inhabitants include the [[Androsphinx|androsphinx]] [[Oracle|oracle]] [[Phatep the Sagacious]], who seeks heroic [[Adventurer|adventurers]] to pursue a solution to [[Undead|undead]] creatures emerging from a subterranean temple under the command of the twisted [[Abadar|Abadaran]] [[Mummy|mummy]] Hahtebket.
