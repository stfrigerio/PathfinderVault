> The city of **Iz** (pronounced IZ) was the first to fall to the [[Demon|demonic]] forces which poured out of the [[Worldwound]] in [[4606 AR]].


## History

> Once the capital of the [[Kellid]] [[Sarkoris|Kingdom of Sarkoris]], the city long served as the headquarters of the [[Abyss|Abyssal]] forces occupying [[Golarion]]. Other demon princes sent emissaries to the various "embassies" there, in the hopes of advancing their devious causes.  When the Worldwound opened, Iz was located a full-day's ride southwest of the tear in reality. Despite the Worldwound's expansions that threatened Iz with windstorms and earthquakes, the city avoided totally falling into the Worldwound, though two-thirds of the city collapsed into the Worldwound itself when the rift first opened.
> Being primarily a habitat for demons, Iz had no real government in the traditional sense. Much like the other major cities of the region, it did have a single dominant figure whose desires were not contradicted: the powerful [[Balor|balor]] [[Khorramzadeh]], also known as the [[Storm King]].
> Iz is close to numerous [[Metal|metal]]-producing mines, and was the metalworking centre of Sarkoris. This tradition continued throughout the demonic occupation, although the mine workers suffered under the [[Whip|whips]] of demonic overseers and broke all previous production records.
> The expansion of the nearby rift to the [[Abyss]] led to the entire region becoming unstable. As a result, Iz and its environs suffered from sudden earthquakes and eldritch storms which transformed the landscape. This raw [[Chaos|chaos]] made the area very popular with new arrivals from the Abyss, easing their transition to life on the [[Material Plane]].
