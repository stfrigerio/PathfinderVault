> The **Blistering Vault** is an isolated region of the Elemental [[Plane of Earth]]; its boundaries are dotted with the fossilised bones of hapless visitors.
> The stone of the Blistering Vault gives off a strange [[Radiation|radiation]] that kills most life-forms. True [[Fire elemental|fire elementals]] and [[Mephit|mephits]] are immune to this effect, so they sometimes use this region as a refuge.
