> The **Adamantine Morass** is the lair of the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dragon|dragon]] [[Deity|god]] [[Dahak]]. The Morass consists of a vast cavern network carved into the rocky spires of [[Caina]], the eighth layer of [[Hell]]. Befitting a god of dragons, the entrances to Dahak's realm are accessible only by flight.
