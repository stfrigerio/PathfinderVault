> The **Ivory Labyrinth** is the [[Abyssal realm]] of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Baphomet]].



## History

> Baphomet was originally imprisoned in the Ivory Labyrinth by [[Asmodeus]] for attempting to steal the Prince of Darkness's [[Ruby|ruby]] [[Scepter|scepter]]. Asmodeus claimed the maze was unsolvable, but the wily and cunning Baphomet escaped it after only 10 years. With his escape, thinner but wiser, the Lord of Minotaurs fled [[Hell]] with the Labyrinth in tow, and it rapidly became the demon lord's personal demesne.
> In honor of their patron's realm, [[Mortal|mortal]] cults of Baphomet refer to themselves as [[Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth]].


## Description

> The first maze always encountered by visitors is the namesake Ivory Maze; the walls, ceilings, and floors of the hallways and chambers of this section are entirely covered with uncountable bones of every description. Beyond it, the realm is easily as large as some [[Planet|planets]], and employs confusing twists of all sorts of architecture, geography, and [[Metaphysics|metaphysics]]. Explorers have reported that its many treacherous terrains include cities' worth of tightly packed streets, entire mountain ranges criss-crossed with winding paths, plains with jagged protrusions of bones, vast warrens of underground tunnels, impassible swamps, twisted rivers, and impenetrable forests.


## Inhabitants

> The realm is populated by [[Minotaur|minotaurs]] and [[Demon|demons]] of all sorts. An array of demonic secret societies—in addition to Baphomet's cult—also have headquarters here, each paying homage to its master. [[Damned]] [[Soul|souls]] also wander the labyrinth eternally, being slain and reforming in an endless cycle of torment. [[Vilsteth]] demons also take shape in the depths of the Ivory Labyrinth, birthed from the essence of the Labyrinth itself, combined with the souls of those who abused positions of authority during their mortal lives.


### Specific inhabitants

> - The first [[Inverted giant|inverted giant]], a beast known as [[Igramalash]], lies imprisoned within the Ivory Labyrinth.
> - Igramalash's creator, the first [[Runelords|Runelord]] of Wrath, [[Alderpash]], was imprisoned here for failing in a promise to Baphomet.
> - The twin-bodied [[Marilith|marilith]] [[Ylleshka]] is the primary warden of the Labyrinth's Ineluctable Prison.
