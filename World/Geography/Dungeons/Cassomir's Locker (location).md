> The [[Imperial Naval Shipyards]] district of [[Cassomir]] has been rebuilt many times in the city's history, growing from a small wharf into a large dockyard and finally into the great shipyards of the empire. Layers of construction and the land's natural tendency to sink into the [[Blackwood Swamp]], resulted into a huge underground complex of flooded tunnels, abandoned basements, sewers, and vaults which is known as **Cassomir's Locker**. The Locker is said to be home to [[Crocodile|crocodiles]], [[PathfinderWiki/Organizations/Rat|huge rats]], and giant insects, and only a small part of the Locker has been explored. Explorations of the shallowest levels have generated stories of [[Dero|deros]], [[Drow|drow]], [[Duergar|duergar]], and other creatures of the [[Darklands]] living just below the city. All known entrances are permanently sealed or guarded.
> Many citizens consider the stories of vile deros lurking under the city as rumblings of the mad but the truth is that the large dero city of [[Corgunbier]] lies below Cassomir.
