> **Justnoque** is a sunken city underneath the [[Steaming Sea]], off the coast of [[Varisia]] and the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. In the times of ancient [[Thassilon]], Justnoque was a center of learning and metallurgy in the kingdom of [[Cyrusian]], but it now lies ruined under the waves; only about a dozen slick black stones jutting from the water mark its presence. The sunken city is feared by the Linnorm Kings, but adventurers sometimes set sail from the Linnorm King city of [[Jol]] to explore Justnoque; the few that return tell tales of aquatic [[Giant|giants]] inhabiting the ruins.
