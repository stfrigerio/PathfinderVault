> The **Tomb of the Bound Sphinx** is a pyramid shaped tomb constructed in the [[Barrier Wall]] mountains. It was constructed in [[-1116 AR]] by [[Pharaoh]] [[Kenaton]], to be his final resting place.  Unfortunately, it was unknowingly built over an underground chamber, which it collapsed into a few decades after construction.  This destroyed some of the treasure it contained and shifted some of its passages, making exploration difficult.
> As well as the final resting place for Kenaton, the tomb also contains a magical prison which contains [[Hephtethnet the Reaver]], a [[Hieracosphinx|hieracosphinx]] who terrorized [[Osirion]] during Kenaton's life.
