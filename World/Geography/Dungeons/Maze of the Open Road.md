## History

The Maze of the Open Road contains magical [[Teleportation|teleportation]] portals, used in times past by the [[Decemvirate]] to travel to the lodge for meetings. Narven planted additional portals within the Maze that brought in strange beasts as time went on, making it dangerous to traverse its paths. One of the portals leads to the top of the great central pyramid of [[Arl]] on the planet [[Akiton]].
