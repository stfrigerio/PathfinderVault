> In the eastern [[Tusk Mountains]] of the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] lies a deep pit that resembles an inverted 13-layer ziggurat. The layers are littered with the bones of massive animals; and the lower the layer, the larger the bones, until they dwarf those of the largest creatures known to walk the surface of [[Golarion]] today.
> At the bottom of this pit is an opening just large enough to admit an average-sized humanoid, known as the **Earthnavel**, or **sipapu** to the local [[Kellid human ethnicity|Kellid]] tribes. Below it stretch miles of freezing-cold tunnels which lead down into [[Nar-Voth]], the upper layer of the [[Darklands]]. These passages show signs of collapse, suggesting that there may have once been larger tunnels here that extended beneath Nar-Voth into the deeper Darklands. It is possible many large beasts of the [[Tolguth]] in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords migrated there from [[Deep Tolguth]] in [[Orv]] via now-collapsed tunnels.


## Inhabitants

> The Earthnavel is guarded not only by large, terrible beasts, but also by the [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] of fur-clad warriors from a bygone age. They attack those who do not have the proper totems and perform the proper rituals. Some also claim that the tunnels are inhabited by a race of intelligent, advanced [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]]. The very powerful [[Orc|orc]] [[Cleric|cleric]] [[Murrog One-Ear]] dwells near the narrowest part of the Earthnavel, seeking a set of magical skulls that would allow her to widen the pit releasing the beasts of Deep Tolguth upon the surface world.
