> The **Collapsed Halls** are the haunted ruins of a castle located on the upper [[Maiestas River]] west of the [[Barrowood]], near the borders of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] [[Archduchy of Menador|Archduchies of Menador]] and [[Archduchy of the Heartlands|the Heartlands]].


## History

> The castle, originally called the **Halls of Zuberi**, was constructed around the turn of the 44th century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]] by [[Meskhenet]], a mistress of a wealthy [[Osirion|Osirian]] merchant named [[Khalfani Zuberi]]. She abandoned it in less than a decade, upsetting Zuberi into abandoning it completely. The castle collapsed years later.


## Inhabitants

> While most inhabitants of Cheliax consider the ruins simply an abandoned mess full of greasy, corrupted [[Plant|plants]] and fungi, it is in fact secretly inhabited by [[Blighted fey|blighted fey]] led by a blighted [[Huldra|huldra]] named [[Lenira Re]]. The fey seek to corrupt the [[Barrowood]], and capture fey and [[Humanoid|humanoids]] who pass by the ruins in their pursuit of this goal.
