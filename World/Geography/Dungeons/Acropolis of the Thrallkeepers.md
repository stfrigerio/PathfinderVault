## History

> Dating back to the age of [[Thassilon]], the acropolis was built by an order of [[Wizard|wizards]] named the [[Thrallkeepers]], who were rivals of the Therassic Monks.


## Structure

> The acropolis is built of black granite flecked with red crystal, and its sole surviving surface feature is a partially collapsed tower bearing the [[Sihedron Rune]] near its 20-foot-tall exterior doors. A stairway leads from those doors deep underground.
