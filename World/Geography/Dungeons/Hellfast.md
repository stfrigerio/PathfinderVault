> **Hellfast** is a labyrinth of cold and lightless halls and chambers beneath [[Bastion Dominus]] in [[Citadel Vraid]]. The entrance to Hellfast is a simple, steep stairway hidden behind a wall in [[Acillmar|Paravicar Acillmars]] private chambers in [[Paravicar's Tower|Paravicars Tower]]. Hellfast acts as the venue for [[Order of the Nail|Order of the Nails]] most secretive rituals. [[Aboliet Rast]] works here with an [[Erinys|erinys]] who serves as the chapel guardian.
