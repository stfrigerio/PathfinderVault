> The **ruins of El-Amara** are in western [[Osirion]], close to the border with [[Thuvia]]. The ruins lie close to where the [[Junira]] and the [[Scarab River]] meet.
> On the other side of the Junira, in nearby [[Thuvia]], are the [[Ruins of Akhenaten]].
> El-Amara was once the provincial capital of Thuvia, when Thuvia was still part of the Ancient Osirion. It was abandoned and fell to ruin when pharaohs started to ignore their distant vassal state. It was in el-Amara that [[Fentet-Pesu|High Theurgist Fentet-Pesu]], the last Osirian governor of Thuvia, was assassinated in [[-841 AR]]. Since its fall, few had visited the half-buried spires and crumbling bell towers of el-Amara, until a few centuries ago when disciples of [[Ahriman]] took to the ruins to establish a base near Osirion. Currently el-Amara is populated by [[Sepid|sepid divs]] led by general [[Karesh-Ekhial]] and hordes of [[Ghul|ghul]] and [[Edimmu|edimmu]] thralls.
