 A [[Neothelid|neothelid]] of Denebrum.
> **Denebrum** is one of the Vaults of [[Orv]]—the deepest layer of the [[Darklands]]—hidden under northwestern [[Avistan]]: [[Varisia]]. It is bordered by [[Deep Tolguth]] to the east, [[Ilvarandin]] to the south, and the [[Sightless Sea]] to the west. It is the home of a race of truly ancient, gigantic worm-like creatures known as [[Neothelid|neothelids]].


## Geography

> Denebrum is shaped roughly like a crescent and stretches for nearly a thousand miles from below [[Kalsgard]] to the [[Varisian Gulf]] and the northeast coast of [[Conqueror's Bay|Conquerors Bay]].
> Denebrum consists of swamps and forests of [[Fungi|fungi]], growing out of mud and stagnant water. Each neothelid lives alone from its fellows in a towering, twisted spire of stone and resin known as a hive; each is served by fanatical [[Seugathi|seugathi]] minions.


## Inhabitants

> Denebrum is dominated by the neothelids, an ancient race that once fought the [[Vault Keepers]] and [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]] for control of the Darklands, but now seem to be in decline. Neothelids can be found elsewhere in the Darklands, but the vast majority of them live here.
> At one time, the expansionist [[Intellect devourer|intellect devourers]] of [[Ilvarandin]] sought to extend their territory into Denebrum. The neothelids drove them out and, 500 years ago, decided to counter-attack. There are now seugathi forces camped in northern Ilvarandin, and it is not clear whether the intellect devourers will be able to defeat them.
