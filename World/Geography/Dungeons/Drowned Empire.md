> The **Drowned Empire** is a colossal city of ruined temples and cathedrals deep beneath the waters of [[Stygia]] that were brought there by [[Geryon]] over countless eons. These dilapidated holy places were dedicated to [[Deity|deities]] now dead or those who never were. Hidden amongst this graveyard of monuments are the treasures and [[World/Items & Equipment/Artifacts/Artifact|artifacts]] of their worshipers bearing lost [[Magic|magic]], lore, or knowledge yet to be discovered. The Source of Lies is the Drowned Empire's only inhabitant as it scours its sacrilegious collection ceaselessly for unknown reasons.
