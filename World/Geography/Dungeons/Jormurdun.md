> **Jormurdun** is one of the ten ancient [[Sky Citadel|Sky Citadels]] built by the newly-emergent [[Dwarf|dwarves]] at the end of their [[Quest for Sky]]. It is located in the [[Wolfcrags]], a largely uninhabited range of hills in the northwest of the [[Sarkoris Scar|Sarkoris Scars]] (formerly the [[Worldwound|Worldwounds]]) [[Frostmire]] region. Like other Sky Citadels, Jormurdun was built almost completely underground. Roughly two-thirds of its subterranean chambers are filled with still-functioning dwarven [[Trap|traps]] laid there by its departing inhabitants thousands of years ago, while the rest is the domain of a clan of [[Duergar|duergar]] who have recently been converted from their ancestral worship of [[Droskar]] to that of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Shivaska]] by her chosen, the [[Kalavakus|kalavakus]] [[Demon|demon]] [[Yealek-Vor]].
> The [[Pathfinder Society]] took a personal interest in Jormurdun, successfully locating and securing the entrance in [[4714 AR]]. Expeditions later recovered King Gutheran's piece of the *[[Sky Key]]* that same year, and the remaining pieces were reassembled the year after, but the *Sky Key* was overloaded and broken by the [[Harbingers of Fate]] during its first demonstration.



## History

> Around [[1600 AR]], duergar attacked the citadel and conquered it. The dwarves who survived the attack fled, while Gutheran, the last king of the Sky Citadel, broke the *Sky Key* into five pieces, keeping one piece for himself and handing a piece to each of his heirs, and hoped that one day the *Key* would reassemble and the dwarves would return to Jormurdun. Gutheran resolved to die defending Jormurdun's throne room alongside a handful of loyalists, but the *Sky Key'*s activation trapped hundreds of survivors in a bubble outside of time when the citadel fell.
> His heirs became known as the Scions of Jormurdun, who scattered across the [[Inner Sea region]] with what remained of their people. The eldest brother, Toggrim, believed his piece of the *Key* should be returned to [[Numeria]]; his branch of the refugees settled across that nation, [[Mendev]], and [[Sarkoris]], but have largely come to live in poverty in [[Chesed]]'s Fleshward slum. The princess [[Logyra]] led her followers to distant [[Garund]], where they joined their [[Pahmet]] kin and helped shape the beliefs of the [[Ouat]]. Sigrin led her group to settle in the [[Bandu Hills]] of the [[Mwangi Expanse]], allying with the [[Grippli|grippli]] of Krihirik and founding the settlement of Ashkurhall; eventually devastated by [[Diseases of Golarion|plague]], the survivors abandoned it to join the nomadic [[Taralu]] dwarves, who had them abandon all ties to their pasts in order to adopt their culture. [[Naldak]], his youngest son, fled west into the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], founding the settlement of [[Naldak's Point|Naldaks Point]]; the town was taken into the *[[Hao Jin Tapestry]]* after [[Baba Yaga]]'s eternal winter threatened to consume it, but as the [[Demiplane|demiplane]] began to fail in the centuries after the [[Ruby Phoenix]]'s disappearance, most turned to [[Droskar]]'s worship and became [[Duergar|duergar]], while the remaining true dwarves died out.


## Layout

> As has already been stated, almost all of Jormurdun is located underground. The only visible outbuilding on the surface is a single three-story tower that sits on the edge of a cliff several hundred feet in height. The tower and the mountainside it sits upon look innocuous, except when the light of the [[Sun|sun]] combines with the Worldwound's unusual weather and reveal ancient, eroded carvings of dwarven faces carved into the cliffside. Many hard to distinguish windows dot the eastern face of the mountain as well, either cleverly hidden in the rock's natural formations, or else sealed by stone shutters from the inside. These windows once let in the morning light, but have been closed for thousands of years.


### Interior Chambers

> Approximately two-thirds of the below-ground chambers and halls of Jormurdun are filled with ancient dwarven traps or guardians, or are now the lair of denizens of the [[Darklands]] who have traveled up to the Sky Citadel from below. The rest have fallen under the control of a band of grey dwarves who worship the demon lord Shivaska.


## Inhabitants

> Besides the Darklands creatures who live in Jormurdun, the halls of the Sky Citadel were inhabited by a clan of duergar led by a kalavakus demon named Yealek-Vor. Yealek-Vor was a devotee of the demon lord Shivaska and discovered Jormurdun in [[4689 AR]]. Although they once were loyal followers of Droskar, Yealek-Vor converted most of the duergar to the worship of his demonic patron. The grey dwarves scoured the halls for ancient dwarven artifacts, hoping to use them to further their demonic patron's stature within the Worldwound, until they were defeated by the Pathfinder Society in [[4715 AR]].
