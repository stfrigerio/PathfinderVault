> The **Garden of Lead**, also known as the **Pleasure Palace of the Dead**, was a place the nobility of [[Ustalav]] used to come to relax amidst waterfall gardens and a fantastic menagerie of magical beasts. When the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] took control of the country in the 33rd century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]], he sent his minion [[Dissayn]] there with a collection of nobles she had collected. Her [[Skeleton|skeletal]] drove its captors into the Garden and then filled the pools, canals, and walkways with molten lead, killing the noblemen and women instantly. The Garden of Lead is now a horrifically haunted place, even by the standards of [[Virlych]], and lead statues of costumed nobles still remain to this day. Dissayn is also rumored to have retreated here after the defeat of the Whispering Tyrant in [[38' AR]] at the of the [[Shining Crusade]]. Other known inhabitants are [[Adamantine golem|adamantine golems]], [[Allip|allips]], [[Fire elemental|fire elementals]], [[Magma ooze|magma oozes]], [[Mohrg|mohrgs]], [[Salamander|salamanders]], and skeletons.
> Now the Garden of Lead is a place of endless 'parties' among pools of molten metal, where tortured ghosts of costumed revelers and undead servants provide grotesque entertainment for their dread mistress.
