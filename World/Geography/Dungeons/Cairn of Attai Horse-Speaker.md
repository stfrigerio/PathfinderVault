> The **Cairn of Attai Horse-Speaker** is the tomb of an ancient [[Nidal|Nidalese]] horselord, now overrun by sinister [[Fey|fey]].


## History

> Ten thousand years ago, [[Attai Horse-Speaker]] ruled a clan of [[Kellid]] [[Barbarian|barbarians]] in Nidal. This great horselord as well as his family were killed by a [[Plague|plague]] that swept through his clan. His followers honored their leader by building an impressive mausoleum that would stand the test of time. The Attai's mausoleum was revered for centuries but, eventually, his clan no longer returned to this sacred place. 


## Recent events

> The cairn is now entirely underground in the [[Barrowmoor]], except for the entry room and a weathered statue of Attai.
> A few decades ago, the relentless pressure from an aquifer connected to the [[Usk River]] caused some rooms within the cairn to collapse into watery sinkholes. In [[4715 AR]], a [[Nereid|nereid]] named [[Maddy Whorlwalker]] and her [[Nuckelavee|nuckelavee]] companion, [[Kahak]], invaded the tomb. Maddy was also accompanied by a number of loyal kelpies. The invasion awoke Attai's spirit as a rage-filled [[Cairn wight|cairn wight]].
> Maddy and Kahak prowl the nearby Usk River every night, murdering travelers.
