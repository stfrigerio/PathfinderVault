> **Xin** was the capital of [[Thassilon]] during the reign of its namesake, [[Xin|Emperor Xin]].


## Geography

> Xin was located in southwestern Thassilon, bordering [[Bakrakhan]]. Since [[Earthfall]], it has lain on the ocean floor, some 100 miles from [[Magnimar]]. Its skyline is dominated by the Crystal Palace, Xin's home.


## History

> Xin served as Thassilon's capital during the reign of its founder, Emperor Xin. After Xin's death, the city was allowed to fall into ruin; [[Xin-Cyrusian]], capital of [[Cyrusian]], replaced it as Thassilon's *de facto* capital. Xin, haunted by the First King's [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]], became a forbidden place until Earthfall sank it into the [[Varisian Gulf]]. In modern times, Xin is barely known even among the most learned Thassilonian scholars.
