> The **Tomb of Statues** is the burial place of [[An-Hepsu III|Pharaoh An-Hepsu IIIs]] family and servants, located on the western banks of [[Osirion|Osirions]] [[River Sphinx]] north of the city of [[An]]. Unlike in similar tombs, where the family and retainers of a [[Pharaoh|pharaoh]] were buried alive or put to death following the monarch's passing, An-Hepsu III took advantage of his [[Medusa|medusa]] consort's power, and had them all turned to stone.
