Nation: Katapesh

> Deep within the [[Barrier Wall]] mountains of [[Katapesh]], a network of chambers joined by winding tunnels forms a well-protected complex. Known as the **Beehive**, it is located on the southern road to [[Nex]] and has a number of widely known entrances.
> Inhabitants have included smugglers, [[Slave|slavers]], bandits, [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]], [[Dwarf|dwarves]], and bee-like [[Thriae|thriae]], from which the tunnels got their name. The dwarves moved out when nothing valuable was found behind the rock walls. Currently, a hive of [[Formian|formians]] inhabits the Beehive, though they mostly toil digging new tunnels underground and rarely interact with the surface.
