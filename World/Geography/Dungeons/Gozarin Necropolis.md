> The **Gozarin Necropolis** is a vast field of tombs, crypts, and graveyards within the [[Tremor Valley]] in central [[Osirion]], west of the [[Pillars of the Sun]].


## Structures

> Notable emperors buried here include the Yafeha Dynasty, [[Sekhemib I]], and members of the late Zahur Dynasty. The impressive entrances of the 30-some crypts and tombs lead down to swaths of interconnected catacombs. The central structure in the necropolis is the [[Pyramid of Masks]], the first structure built in Tremor Valley after the death of [[Jetrieti I]] in [[-2957 AR]]. It was the burial site of the [[Masked Pharaoh]] and most of his direct descendants. From this massive structure subsequent rulers built outward and created their own tombs and crypts.


## Jah-Ipo Priesthood

> The [[Jah-Ipo]] priesthood is a small group of [[Cleric|clerics]] that maintains the grave sites of [[Gebessek IX]] and the aboveground levels of the Pyramid of Masks in the Gozarin Necropolis. Their authority does not extend beyond these distinct locations, but they are uneasy with the way [[Adventurer|adventurers]] and tomb delvers pillage the lesser and older graves of the expansive necropolis. In [[4707 AR]], with [[Khemet III]]'s opening of Osirion's tombs to explorers, the Jah-Ipo lost their right to arrest and try grave-robbers.
