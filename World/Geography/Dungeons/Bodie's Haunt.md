> **Bodie's Haunt** was once a settlement in the [[River Kingdoms]], in what is now called the [[Protectorate of the Black Marquis]]. 
> Up until [[4707 AR]], it was home to one of the three rival Marquises vying for control of the [[Pirate Pact]]. However, in that year [[Urdal Bazzak]] arranged for the inhabitants to be slaughtered by [[Numeria|Numerian]] soldiers as his first step to gaining control of the Protectorate.
> Today, the town is a ruin haunted by the angry souls of the slain [[Pirate|pirates]].
