> The **Dead Villages** are a collection of abandoned [[CategoryVillages|Villages]] in the [[Brazen Frontier]] section of southern [[Osirion]]. They were once inhabited by [[Pharasma|Pharasmin]] death cults who believed that one's afterlife could be positively influenced by choosing the time of one's demise. This led the villagers to engage in ritual combat to the death as well as suicide. These practices guaranteed that the cult soon ran out of members, leaving the villages empty. Today, bones can still be found in the central squares of these empty settlements, and distressed [[Undead|undead]], such as [[Allip|allips]], haunt them at night. Even though the cultists believed they were worshiping Pharasma, its leaders secretly were devotees of [[Sifkesh]], [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of heresy and suicide.
