> The **Labyrinth of the Two Hells** is an extensive series of caves under the northern [[Zi Ha]] mountains that is home to two tribes of [[Fiendish|fiendish]] [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]]. The [[Gugrangmyal]] are the "children of the cold hell" while the [[Gutshadmyal]] are the "children of the hot hell", and both equally brutal groups are in a perpetual war against the other. The war, nurtured by the [[Samsaran|samsaran]] Baijan who manipulated the troglodytes' spiritual personas, has persisted for centuries.
