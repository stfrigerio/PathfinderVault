> **Aerduin** was the capital of the [[Melcat|Arch-Duchy of Melcat]] until the coming of the Living God, [[Razmir]]. When [[Melcat person|Duke Melcat]] refused to pledge his fealty to Razmir, the [[Wizard|wizard]] destroyed the town and all of his inhabitants. Now known as **Aerduin's Folly**, the ruins have lain abandoned for 50 years.


## History

> Aerduin's Folly sits on the southern edge of the [[Vergan Forest]] in the southern half of nation of [[Razmiran]]. It was part of a [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] until it was destroyed by Razmir on 17 [[Erastus]] [[4661 AR]]. [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Undead]] eventually began to rise in the ruins, and the place is now controlled by a powerful [[Skeleton|skeleton lord]], who some claim is Duke Melcat himself, risen from the dead to enact his revenge.
