> The **Dungeons of Adamas** are a vast, natural series of caverns and tunnels. The [[Diamond Regiment]] in the tower of [[Adamas]] sits watch over the cavern complex while also using part of the cave system as a prison. Beyond their reach are the cavernous homes of a large number of underground dwellers. Periodically these creatures try to push past the [[Diamond Regiment]], but to date they have been held at bay. At times outsiders are hired by the regiment to strike back or retake territory.
