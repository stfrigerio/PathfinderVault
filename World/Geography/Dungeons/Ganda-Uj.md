> **Ganda-Uj** is the treetop lair of the [[Monkey goblin|monkey goblins]] of [[Mediogalti]]. It consists of precariously balanced bark huts, linked by swaying vines and bridges. Scholars believe that the current site is the fifth lair to bear the name; the other four were accidentally burned down by the fire-loving goblins.
> The goblins delight in attacking travellers, using nets and poison darts to take prisoners, who are then presumably sacrificed to whatever [[Demon|demons]] the goblins worship. It is best to travel through monkey goblin territory in large, well-armed groups.
