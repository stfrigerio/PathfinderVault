> The ruins of the city of **Drowning Stones**, located in the northern [[Mwangi Jungle]] of the [[Mwangi Expanse]], were abandoned by its population when it began to sink into the swamp. It sits about halfway between the [[Olongo River]] to the north and the [[Vanji River]] to the south. Today, only the central fortress remains relatively dry. The city takes its name from the massive standing stones that served as pillars for the central forum.


## Inhabitants

> Concurrently with the abandonment of the settlement, tribes of [[Skum|skum]] began emerging from the [[Darklands]], presumably through some undiscovered entrance to the underground world. The skum now occupy the city, despite the efforts of the local [[Rumawa]] tribe to dislodge them from what the tribe consider to be holy ground. The skum worship the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Sifkesh]] and there is a temple to her in a cavern beneath the city.


## Pathfinder Society

> The [[Pathfinder Society]] maintains a small way-station 24 miles downriver of Drowning Stones. 400 miles away from the ruins, the Society has placed statues representing the Drowning Stones in miniature in the marketplace abutting their [[Pathfinder lodge]] of [[Sharrowsmith's Exports|Sharrowsmiths Exports]] in the city of [[Nantambu]].
