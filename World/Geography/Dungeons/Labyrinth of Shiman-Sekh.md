> The **Labyrinth of Shiman-Sekh** is a maze of black glass obelisks and white marble plazas located near [[Shiman-Sekh]]. It was built during the height of the reign of the [[Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues]], who envisioned it as a [[Trap|trap]] that might [[Binding outsiders|bind]] the power of a [[Deity|godlike]] entity into his own form. In [[-3070 AR]], after many years of construction that claimed the lives of numerous [[Slavery|slaves]], the [[Pharaoh|pharaoh]] targeted the [[Daemon|daemonic]] [[Harbinger|harbinger]] [[Zelishkar]] for his experiment. His attempt ended in a catastrophic failure as Zelishkar overpowered all of his wards, assistants, and [[Magic item|magical devices]] before the pharaoh released an ancient [[Efreeti|efreeti]]. Together, they [[Summon|summoned]] a [[Genie|genie]] army and bound Zelishkar and the 666 fiends rampaging through the labyrinth into the *[[Bottle of the Bound]]*.


## After the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues

> After the [[Song Pharaoh]] overthrew the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues, she sealed the [[Portal|portal]] to the Labyrinth of Shiman-Sekh and founded the city of Shiman-Sekh nearby. In [[-2044 AR]], the [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich]] Pharaoh [[An-Hepsu XI]], with the help of [[Szuriel]], freed Zelishkar from the Labyrinth of Shiman-Sekh to unleash him upon a [[Shory Empire|Shory]] city, but he went out of control and devastated several cities before being re-imprisoned. Zelishkar has since remained in the Labyrinth of Shiman-Sekh, plotting burning vengeance upon [[Osirion]] and all of [[Golarion]] for his imprisonment.
