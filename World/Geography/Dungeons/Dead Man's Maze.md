> **Dead Man's Maze** is the remains of one of the two largest trench systems built during the [[War Without Rivals]] in the area now called [[The Furrows|the Furrows]]; the other is called the [[Peasant Graves]]. Dead Man's Maze is constructed between the ruins of the village of [[Feldgrau]] and the [[House of Ensland]]. Today, the trench systems look like black mazes in the ground and scar the wasteland over many square miles. Within the trenches lie the bodily remains of the fallen soldiers where they were left to rot. Their souls do not necessarily know the war is ended and many reports talk of the wasteland being haunted by [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]]-like soldiers.
