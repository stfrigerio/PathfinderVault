> The **Last Temple** is a legendary site in the godless nation of [[Rahadoum]]. It is believed to exist in the vicinity of the [[Napsune Mountains]], or possibly in the nearby dunes. The last refuge of religion in Rahadoum, it is said to move from place to place, never appearing in the same location twice but turning up just when it is needed by the faithful.
> The temple is said to include colonnades and stepped pyramids, with banners flying in the wind. Inside are spirits of all religions, who appear to the worthy in order to keep religion alive in Rahadoum.
> The Last Temple may be no more than a myth, but desperate preachers have been known to head out into the desert in search of it, hoping to find sanctuary from the [[Pure Legion]].
