> The **Temple of Cayden Cailean** in the town of [[Lilywhite]] on [[Motaku Isle]] was founded in [[4682 AR]] by the captains [[Shaggard Halleck]] and [[Delemona Burie]]. Shaggard and his friend were devotees of [[Cayden Cailean]] and they wanted to build a grand stone temple to the Drunken Hero. Shaggard was killed in an alcohol-fueled duel with a local fisherman in [[4692 AR]] in that same temple.
> The large building is the most prominent building in town and is clearly marked as both a temple of Cayden Cailen and a popular tavern. It is known as **Cailean's Keg** by the locals. Cailean's Keg is owned and operated by the high [[Cleric|cleric]] of the Accidental God in Lilywhite, Duwella Morin.
