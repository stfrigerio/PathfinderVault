 Not all pass the [[Test of the Starstone]] as [[Iomedae]] did.
> The **Shrine of the Failed** is a hall of monuments in [[Absalom|Absaloms]] [[Ascendant Court]] to those who have failed the [[Test of the Starstone]].



## History

> It was founded centuries ago, and routinely expanded since by the families of the fallen and other residents of Absalom.


## Structure

> The shrine consists of a series of stone rooms holding shrines that are as elaborate as the caretakers can manage, but are usually no more than a few personal items of the deceased.


## Inhabitants

> The shrine's caretakers wear black mourning robes, but claim no [[Divine|divine]] calling, holy texts, or [[Philosophy|philosophy]]. Most visitors view it as a novelty and leave quickly, but there are occasionally devout worshippers who believe that one of the failed is a [[Deity|god]] who is merely quiescent.

*See also: Cults of the Failed*
> Some of the failed gods nevertheless gain followers; indeed, some gain genuine followers, but many 'cults' are actually tricksters out to fool the gullible.
