> The **Temple of the Eternal Sun** is the chief temple of [[Sarenrae]] in [[Sothis]], [[Osirion]], constructed in the palace of Osirion's final [[Qadira|Qadiran]] satrap. Shortly before [[Khemet I]] seized control of the country, the church seized the palace of [[Irfan Arikan II]] and remade the building into a symbol of faith rather than foreign rule. Having struck a deal with [[Khemet I]] a year before his rule officially began, the church of Sarenrae contributed many of the palace's furnishings to the construction of the [[Palace of the Forthbringer]]. The twin priests [[Mkhai]] and [[Nebt-Sheni]] lead the Sothan church.
