Nation: Hold of Belkzen
---

> Though highly independent, even proud [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Orc|orc]] chieftains sometimes seek advice. When this happens, most warlords send their seconds-in-command to the [[Endseers]] of the **Brimstone Haruspex**, a temple complex high in the caldera of the smoking Eye of the Unmaker stratovolcano within the northern [[Kodar Mountains]] of the [[Hold of Belkzen]].



## History

> The Haruspex, built at the end of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian empires]] reign, was initially a temple to [[Mhar]]. The Endseers first occupied the complex during the [[Age of Anguish]] and have carried out their prophetic mission in the thousands of years since.


## Inhabitants

An [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Orc|orc]] [[Endseers|Endseer]] [[Oracle|oracle]].
> Two [[Flesh golem|flesh golems]] carved from [[Taiga giant|taiga giant]] bodies with [[Owlbear|owlbear]] claws, heads, and feet guard the compound's entrance, though in the past the guardians were described simply as giant owlbears; whether the guardians were always flesh golems or reconstituted from owlbears remains unknown. The [[Dead Eye tribe]] claims the surrounding territory and harasses pilgrims to the Haruspex, angering the Endseers so much that the oracles offer bounties for their heads.


### Endseers

> Inside the hold, an ancient group of inbred orc [[Oracle|oracles]] of [[Rovagug]] known as the [[Endseers]] offer guidance in exchange for massive tribute. In addition to maintaining the only supposedly complete record of orc history—a lengthy series of cave paintings stretching all the way back to the orcs' initial emergence on the surface of [[Golarion]]—the oracles breathe in the vapors from the active fumaroles in order to spin weird and bloody prophecies.
> As the Endseers lack the [[Engineering|engineering]] competence to maintain their seismically vulnerable temples, they work with local [[Fire giant|fire giants]] to repair and expand the Haruspex. Despite the volcano's devastating eruptions every several centuries, the temples themselves remain largely unscathed.


## Appearance and structures

> The Haruspex consists of sprawling tunnels, caves, spires, a temple, and several constructed chambers, all located high in the Eye of the Unmaker's caldera and surrounded by lava and toxic fumes. Its many structures include:

> - The **Hall of Omens**, a tremendous cavern whose walls are inscribed with millennia of prophecies.
> - The **Tunnel of the Forefathers**, a lava tube that purportedly records orc history on its walls, dating back to the race's emergence on [[Golarion|Golarions]] surface and still maintained by the Endseers.
