> The **Iridian Cathedral** is the heart of the [[Iridian Fold]], both its birthplace and its seat of power within the city of [[Ular Kel]]. The Iridian Cathedral is surmounted by a beautiful blue dome reaching 80 feet in height and also has a large wind-catcher atop it. In front of the cathedral, at the heart of the [[Godsmarket]] district, is a beautiful polished-stone plaza. As the centre of the Iridian Fold, much of the Iridian Cathedral is off limits to non-members, however, those with a genuine interest in the [[Philosophy|philosophy]] of the sect are always welcomed within.
