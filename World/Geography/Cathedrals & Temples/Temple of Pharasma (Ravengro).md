> The **Temple of Pharasma** in [[Ravengro]] is the only religious building still used in the town: there was a small, and now defunct, chapel of [[Pharasma]] in [[Harrowstone]] Prison. It stands to the west of the town and has one of the town's [[Posting Poles]] standing outside. The building is impressive and has a stained-glass window set in the eastern wall that depicts the judging by the Lady of Graves of [[Andachi|Count Andachi]], an infamous past ruler of [[Tamrivena]].
> Today the temple is run by [[Vauran Grimburrow]] who has a dozen acolytes to see that the duties of the temple are fulfilled:

> - tending of the flock in the town and the outlying farms;
> - maintaining the temple's fabric;
> - caring for the [[Restlands]] graveyard to the north of the town;
> - selling [[Holy water|holy water]], [[Potion|magic potions]] and minor [[Magic item|magic items]] to friends of the Temple.
> The Temple has a secure vault for keeping valuables and only Grimburrow has a key for this. The Temple also has extensive records about the town's history.
