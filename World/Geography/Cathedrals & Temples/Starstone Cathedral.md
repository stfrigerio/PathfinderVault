> Arguably the holiest location in all the world, the **Starstone Cathedral** is a monument to [[Deity|divinity]]. The massive structure was created by [[Aroden]] when he raised the [[Starstone]] from the depths of the [[Inner Sea]] in [[1 AR]], and the relic is believed to rest within to this day.


## Description


> The Cathedral stands on a stone column in the center of a wide and seemingly bottomless pit at the heart of [[Absalom|Absaloms]] central [[Ascendant Court]] district. Four bridges span the chasm, each representing one of the four [[Deity|ascended gods]] who attained divinity at this site—in order of their ascendancy: [[Aroden]] ([[1 AR]]), [[Norgorber]] ([[1893 AR]]), [[Cayden Cailean]] ([['65 AR]]), and [[Iomedae]] ([[3832 AR]])—though the bridge for Aroden collapsed in a massive earthquake in [[4698 AR]] after years of poor care by the dead god's aging clergy.
> No one knows for certain what lies within the Cathedral itself, as only a few brave or lucky souls have returned from a failed attempt at the [[Test of the Starstone]]. Those who have entered the Cathedral and returned to tell of it describe a place where [[Magic|magic]] does not function properly and which regularly changes its configuration, challenges and guardians.
