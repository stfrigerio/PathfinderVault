> The **Augur Temple** is the headquarters of the [[Augur|Augurs]], a group of civilized [[Troll|trolls]] who perform [[Magic/Divination|divination]] and fortune-telling by supposedly reading the future in their own entrails: a grim, [[Haruspicy|self-haruspicy]].


## Appearance

> The temple is located in the [[Downmarket]] [[Core district|core district]] of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]], and is one of the only permanent structures in that neighborhood. It is a large complex made up of two sections: the covered entryway and the main temple itself. The entryway is an open area with many giant columns and steps which lead to a covered walkway. The steps are too big for human-sized creatures to easily climb. Trolls often read petitioners' fortunes here, or else are found wandering around the Downmarket district seeking customers or socializing. The covered walkway eventually leads to a pair of massive steel doors which lead into the temple proper.


## Outside the temple

> The only thing non-Augurs know about the main temple is that sections of it are open to the sky, as certain citizens living in the nearby [[Highside Stacks]] district can see down into the lower-lying temple. They report that during heavy rainstorms, the Augurs can be seen cavorting within the inner temple.
