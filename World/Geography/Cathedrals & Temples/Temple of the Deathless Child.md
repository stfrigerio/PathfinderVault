> The **Temple of the Deathless Child** serves as the palace of the [[Walkena|child-god]] in the metropolis of [[Mzali]]. It is a tremendous structure, symmetrical across its northern axis and taking up about 7,150 square feet at ground level, and is located at the center of the city. The temple is home to hundreds of his most zealous followers, and it is defended by a variety of living and [[Undead|undead]] temple guardians. The exterior walls of its royal chamber are notched with arrow slits for defense.
> Several exterior balconies serve as platforms for public addresses and prayers, and a space beneath the southern Balcony of the Noon is a public plaza frequently attended by Mzali's residents during lunch.


> [[Paizo]] published a map and detailed description of the temple on pages 58 and 59 of *[[Undead Unleashed]]*.
