> **Pulura's Fall** is located in the [[Worldwound]], north-east of the city of [[Iz]]. Maybe one of the only places not fully controlled by [[Demon|demons]] in the [[Wounded Lands]], a temple of [[Pulura]], led by the powerful [[Cleric|cleric]] [[Eliandra]], is set in the dried-up waterfall.



## Inhabitants

> The temple is home to [[Cleric|clerics]] of Pulura.


## Features

> The temple is in a drained lake bed haunted by [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] and other [[Undead|undead]], and contains potent anti-demon [[PathfinderWiki/Magic/Abjuration|wards]]. The site has a perpetual, light snowfall during the day, with a clear night sky overhead.


## History

> Pulura's Fall has been besieged by a [[Demon lord|demon lord]] named [[Deskari]] and his army since [[4607 AR]], the year after the opening of the Worldwound. The defences of the temple and the clerics inside have not broken to this day. Before the fall of the city of Iz, noble families used the lake and rivers for burials, floating [[Barge|barges]] down river. The clerics at the waterfall would bless and burn the remains, then send the remains down the falls. As the lands burned and decayed with the opening of the Worldwound, the waters dried up, and all that remains at the bottom of the falls are wrecked barges with bones and other offerings sent with their masters down the falls.
> During the [[First Mendevian Crusade]], demon [[Necromancer|necromancers]] woke the dead below the falls to assault the temple and its clerics. Anyone caught by the undead or demon army trying to escape or giving aid to the temple is hunted down and killed.
