> **High Temple of Pharasma** is an elaborate but sober structure that looms over the [[Necropolis of the Faithful]] in the metropolis of [[Sothis]] in [[Osirion]]. It is the tallest building west of the [[Crimson Canal]]. The priests of the High Temple tend to the graves of the necropolis below and comfort the bereaved loved ones. The clergy is led by [[Inebni Andabar|High Priest Inebni Andabar]].
