 Asmodeus' [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]].
> The **Administrative and Civic Center of Ravounel**, colloquially called the **People's Temple** and formerly known as the **Temple of Asmodeus** and **Temple of Aroden**, is the largest temple in [[Kintargo]] and government capitol of [[Ravounel]]. It dominates the [[Temple Hill Kintargo|Temple Hill]] district.



## History

> The People's Temple began life as a cathedral dedicated to the now dead [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]]. After the [[Thrune Ascendancy]], the newly empowered [[House Thrune|Thrunes]] were quick to convert the temple to their [[Asmodeus|deific patron]] with a diabolic sacrifice of the now [[Insanity|half-mad]] clergy of Aroden. This gave birth to the powerful [[Undead|undead]] [[Herecite|herecites]] that now guard the belfry.
> After Ravounel's independence, the new regime voted to turn the Temple of Asmodeus into the government capitol and officially renamed it the Administrative and Civic Center of Ravounel.


## Appearance

> The temple's towering dome and belfry rise high atop Temple Hill overlooking the rest of the district. Its once graceful façade has been converted to the new [[Cheliax|Chelish]] style, reinforced with brutal [[Iron|iron]] and [[Magic|magically]] altered to add images of [[Devil|devils]] and [[Hell|hellscapes]]. The temple is a circle 300 feet in diameter and topped by an impressive 200-foot-diameter dome primarily supported by five enormous stone ribs. The centre of the temple beneath this dome descends in pentagonal terraces to the central altar. A blot of permanent darkness enshrouds the southern part of the central nave, and surrounding it are separate areas for living and other mundane temple activities.
> The People's Temple is currently undergoing renovation, but progress has been slow due to the lack of agreement between squabbling stakeholders concerning its new architecture.


## Clergy, congregation, and inhabitants

> Despite its size, the Temple of Asmodeus has never been popular in Kintargo. Designed to seat hundreds for its profane ceremonies, the nave is rarely host to more than a few dozen followers. The temple is led by [[Corinstian Grivenner|High Priest Corinstian Grivenner]] who, rumour has it, is the secret lover of [[Aluceda Zhol]], high priestess of the [[Shadowsquare|nearby temple]] of [[Zon-Kuthon]]. The temple's clergy include a variety of powerful priests and associates, including the [[Varisia|Varisian]] [[Harrower|harrower]] [[Zella Zidlii]] and the mysterious [[Vishkanya|vishkanya]] [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]] known only as The Gardener.
> The Temple of Asmodeus also boasts a variety of [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] defenders, including [[Gaav|host devils]], [[Hell hound|hell hounds]], [[Hamatula|barbed devils]], and even a powerful [[Gelugon|ice devil]], to name but a few. The Temple also boasts a host of [[Construct|construct]] defenders, including [[Blood golem|blood]], [[Clay golem|clay]], and rare stained-glass golems.
