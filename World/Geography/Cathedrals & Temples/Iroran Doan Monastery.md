> The **Iroran Doan Monastery**, dedicated to the god [[Irori]], is one of the most spectacular hanging monasteries of the [[Wall of Heaven|Wall of Heaven Mountains]]. Located atop the [[Lamjung Pass]] near [[Lamjung|Mount Lamjung]], the Iroran Doan Monastery hangs at the top of the [[Wall of Lamjung]], a six-thousand-foot-tall sheer cliff. From this position, the Iroran Doan Monastery is able to overlook the [[Gokan Saddle]], the gap in the Wall of Heaven Mountains that allows [[Goka]] land access to the rest of Tian Xia.
