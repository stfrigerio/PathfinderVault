> The **Bulwark of Gorum** in [[New Stetven]] is a temple dedicated to the [[Gorum|Lord of Iron]], and is the largest of its kind in [[Brevoy]].
> Unlike most structures in the Brevic province of [[Rostland]], which is poor in minerals and relies on wood as a building material for even noble manors, the Bulwark of Gorum is constructed of imported stone.
