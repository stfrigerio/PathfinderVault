*This article covers the temple of [[Calistria]]. For the organization, see [[Imvrildarai]].*
> The ancient [[Calistria|Calistrian]] temple of **Imvrildara**, located in the southern [[Fierani Forest]] of [[Kyonin]], is the base for the [[Deity|goddesss]] most militant sect of worshipers: the [[Imvrildarai]], defenders of the forest against [[World/Religion/Deities/Treerazer]] and its [[Demon|demonic]] armies.



## History

> The temple's history dates back nearly 10 millennia, to its completion in [[-5570 AR]] at the request of a forgotten sovereign. It was located at that time near the center of a much more expansive Kyonin than today's nation. The fortress-like stone temple is named for a Calistrian priest who authored and illustrated a record of the Savored Sting's role in the battle against [[Rovagug]].
> Imvrildara's modern reputation as a base against [[World/Religion/Deities/Treerazer]], however, began in [[2497 AR]] when it became a home for refugees from the [[Demon|demons]] destructive rampage. Among those refugees was the farmer [[Alendeil]], who became a priest of Calistria, then later single-handedly defended the temple against Treerazer's [[Nalfeshnee|nalfeshnee]] [[Echataxun]] through a miraculous act of Calistria that sealed the demon in stone.
> Nearly two centuries later, in [[2632 AR]], the Imvrildarai led [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Elf|elves]] returning from [[Castrovel]] against Treerazer with such success that the order relented and retreated to academic pursuits.
> In [[3732 AR]], during a campaign by the [[Glabrezu|glabrezu]] [[Mokravud]] into the Fierani Forest, a [[Retriever|retriever]] broke through the temple's defenses and destroyed its Tower of Lust.


## Structure

> While showing its thousands of years of age through overgrowth and use, Imvrildara's persistence is also a testament of its durability. Trees spring through its stone floors near and between its three outer towers—the towers of Revenge and Deceit, which extend four floors skyward, and the ruined Tower of Lust. The fourth and largest central structure, of which only a single domed floor extends above ground, descends into three sub-basements.
> Its main [[Iron|iron]] gates stand 15 feet tall and 10 feet wide. As is common among worshipers of Calistria, the Imvrildarai's priests cultivate [[Wasp|wasp]] hives, including constructed [[Warmonger wasp|warmonger wasps]], throughout the premises as part of its defense.
> In addition to its living quarters, sanctuary, and other basic accommodations, the temple also includes an archive of historical records, several studies and libraries focused on combating the demonic threat, a combat training room, reliquaries, armory, Ocularum, a bone shrine of slain enemies, and a secret library of demonic stone.


## Organization
