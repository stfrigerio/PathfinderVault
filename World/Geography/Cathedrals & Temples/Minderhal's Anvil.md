**Minderhal's Anvil** is an ancient temple to the [[Giant|giant]] smith-god [[Minderhal]] located in the [[Iron Peaks]] on the shores of the [[Storval Deep]]. Built thousands of years ago in the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] nation of [[Shalast]] with the labor of [[Slavery|enslaved]] [[Rune giant|rune]] and [[Stone giant|stone giants]], the temple is dominated by enormous, cracked marble pillars, a gigantic forge-altar, and a stone statue of Minderhal seated on his throne looking out over the Storval Deep with his chin resting on his fist. Few modern giants visit this old site, and the immense furnace, traditionally fed by the bodies of convicted criminals, stands cold.
