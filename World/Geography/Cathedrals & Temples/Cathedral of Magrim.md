> The **Cathedral of Magrim** in the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] city of [[Larrad]] in [[Five Kings Mountains]] maintains the tombs of the Five Kings' oldest residents, and employs [[Necromancy|necromantic magic]] to commune with the spirits of the ancestors. The Cathedral also supports expeditions into the ruins of [[Saggorak]], which is under threat from [[Undead|undead]] and creatures from the [[Darklands]].

***Main article: [[Taal Mornat]]***
> Approximately six centuries ago, dwarves constructed the ossuary of [[Taal Mornat]] especially for the servants of the Cathedral of Magrim in Larrad as well as other faithful servants of the [[Magrim|dwarven god]]. The necropolis lies some twenty miles west of the city in a hidden valley within the peaks of the Five Kings Mountains. Over time, due to the fame of many laid to rest there, the site is now a [[Holy|holy]] and cultural centre for the dwarven community.
