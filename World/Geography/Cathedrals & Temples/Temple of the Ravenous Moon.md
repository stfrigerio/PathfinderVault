> The **Temple of the Ravenous Moon**, originally just called the **Temple of the Moon**, is in the [[Terwa Uplands]], in an area considered to lie within the [[Shackles]]. It is an ancient ziggurat constructed of a red-veined white stone.
> It gets its name from the carvings on its walls, which show scenes of mass sacrifices under a grinning, befanged [[Moon|moon]]. The savage [[Kuru|kuru]] tribes which live in the region avoid the temple.
> The [[Hurricane King]], leader of the [[Shackles Pirates]], has sent two missions to investigate the temple, but neither of them returned. It is rumoured that the [[Pathfinder Society]] may be preparing to send its own expedition from [[Nantambu]]; plus [[Hemdak Wavebaiter]] has called for [[Adventurer|adventurers]] to explore the temple in an attempt to garner himself favour with the Hurricane King.
