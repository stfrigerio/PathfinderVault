> The abandoned **Kamawgyar Shrine** is located in the [[Zho Mountains]] of [[Qadira]] northeast of the [[Pashman River]]. It features a massive statue of the god [[Irori]] placed over a natural cave where the priests who once served the shrine lived. It is now the home of a mother and daughter [[Harpy|harpy]] who were exiled from the large harpy community at [[Al-Bashir]], along with a small retinue of [[Dire corby|dire corbies]].
