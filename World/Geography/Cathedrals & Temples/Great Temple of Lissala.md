The **Great Temple of Lissala**, located in central [[Bakrakhan]], was the largest and most famous temple of [[Lissala]], the patron [[Deity|goddess]] of [[Thassilon]], and home to the *[[Chalice of Lissala]]*, an [[Artifact|artifact]] gifted by the goddess herself. The temple sank beneath the [[Varisian Gulf]] when [[Earthfall]] hit, and it is now home to Vanush, a [[Kraken|kraken]] who uses the *Chalice of Lissala* to lure sailors to their dooms. Vanush seeks to gather sacrifices and relics so the kraken can restore Lissala's faith in the [[Inner Sea region]], with itself as leader.
