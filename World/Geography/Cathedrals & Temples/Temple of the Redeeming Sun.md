> The **Temple of the Redeeming Sun** in the [[Thuvia|Thuvian]] city state of [[Merab]] honours the city's patron deity, [[Sarenrae]]. It is the largest house of worship of any of that nation's five city states. An [[Osiriani]] translation of the [[Book of the Damned]] is housed under heavy guard within the temple. Known as the Plaques of the Black Sun, it supposedly gives extensive descriptions of cults honoring the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Belial]], and contains numerous evil spells.
