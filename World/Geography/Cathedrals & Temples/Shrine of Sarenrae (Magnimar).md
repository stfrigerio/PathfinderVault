> An abandoned shrine to the goddess [[Sarenrae]] exists in the [[Underbridge]] district of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]]. It was built in the early days of the settlement by a priest of the goddess named [[Vosten|Father Vosten]], who felt that the burgeoning community could use the Dawnflower's guidance. He was approached a few months after its completion by [[Sczarni|Sczarni thugs]] who demanded protection money. When he refused to pay and attempted to drive them off, he and his acolytes were killed. Their bodies were buried in the small graveyard behind the shrine. The shrine has lain abandoned ever since, as no devotee of Sarenrae has come forward to rebuild it.
