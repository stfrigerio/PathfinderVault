> The **Basilica of the Last Man** is oldest temple to [[Aroden]] in [[Golarion]]. This enormous domed structure is, now, largely a tourist destination and landmark for all in [[Oppara]]. Aroden's few remaining clergy still maintain a presence here, mainly due to [[Basri|Father Basri]], who leads maintenance efforts and the collection of Arodenite [[World/Items & Equipment/Artifacts/Artifact|artifacts]] and [[Holy|holy]] relics.
