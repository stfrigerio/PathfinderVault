> The **Cathedral of Abadar** in [[Vyre]] lies along the infamous [[Heretic's Row|Heretics Row]]. Like all of the other once-religious buildings, it has long been abandoned by its original congregation: worshippers of [[Abadar]].
> Most such derelict temples on Heretic's Row play host to a constantly rotating roster of vice and debauchery, but the Cathedral of Abadar does not. It has long been home to the [[Scarlet Sign]], a malicious cult dedicated to maintaining a powerful political presence in the City of Masks. They are secretly led by a [[Vrolikai|vrolikai]] [[Demon|demon]] called [[Vissagho]].
