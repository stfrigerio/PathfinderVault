**Azghaad's Spire**, located in the grand temple of [[Nethys]] in [[Sothis]]—the [[Temple of the All-Seeing Eye]]—is a sanctum for devoted adherents of [[Azghaad I|Pharaoh Azghaad the All-Seeing]]. The complex is built in the shape of a series of concentric circles, and only the priesthood of Nethys may enter the innermost heart of the structure. At the center, a [[Veinstone|veinstone]] obelisk rises to a height equal to (but not exceeding) the [[High Temple of Pharasma Sothis|High Temple of Pharasma]]. 


## History

> The original spire was destroyed following the [[Qadira|Qadiran]] invasion of [[1532 AR]], but was rebuilt in [[4620 AR]] by [[Malika Azdari|High Theurgist Malika Azdari]]. It is rumored that the obelisk's amber-colored glass capstone is a piece of Azghaad's otherwise lost royal tomb, but priests have refused to answer questions about the spire.
> The mutilated body of the Insatiable Pharaoh, [[Jetrieti V]], was discovered attached to Azghaad's Spire in [[-2866 AR]], and many at the time considered this to be the judgement of the ancient god-kings on the corruption of the current [[Pharaoh|pharaohs]]. It was noticed that Jetrieti V's successor, [[Jetrieti VI]], was a more careful ruler.
