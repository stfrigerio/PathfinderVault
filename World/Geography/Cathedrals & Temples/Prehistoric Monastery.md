> The **Prehistoric Monastery** is a squat, windowless stone building surrounded by standing stones, located slightly north of [[Sarkomand]] in [[Leng]]. It is the home of the [[High-Priest Not To Be Described]], who stands before a well and plays strange [[Music|melodies]] as he waits for sacrifices from the inhabitants of Leng.
