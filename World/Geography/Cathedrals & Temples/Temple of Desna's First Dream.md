> The **Temple of Desna's First Dream** is a soaring temple of glass, [[Diamond|diamond]], and [[Magic|magic]], formerly located in the city of [[Xin-Edasseril]] in [[Thassilon]].
> The Temple of Desna's First Dream was built atop a menhir far older than Thassilon. The crux of [[Ley line|ley lines]] that shifted from its original location long ago, this menhir dates from when [[Golarion]] was still young, and is believed by the local [[Kellid|Kellids]] to be the original site where [[Desna]] dreamt and transformed from her original alien form into her current [[Humanoid|humanoid]] form, which accounts for the temple's connection to the [[Dimension of Dreams]].
> Near the end of Thassilon, the temple became a place for [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Belimarius]] to conduct her research into the Dimension of Dreams. On the eve of [[Earthfall]], the Temple of Desna's First Dream was wrenched from Xin-Edasseril and relocated to the Dimension of Dreams by Desna herself. To this day, it is one of the few permanent sites in the ever-changing [[Dreamscape|dreamscapes]]. It is now patrolled by [[Animate dream|animate dreams]] and other monsters of the Dimension of Dreams. The central gate is locked by powerful [[PathfinderWiki/Magic/Abjuration|abjuration]] magic; nearby doors lead to Belimarius' treasuries, guarded by the [[Dreamthief hag|dreamthief hag]] Ezshathera and her coven.
