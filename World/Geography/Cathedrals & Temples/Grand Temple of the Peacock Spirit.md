> The **Grand Temple of the Peacock Spirit**, headquarters of the cult of the [[Peacock Spirit]], is located on an island in a lake within a hidden valley near the source of the first tributary of the [[Chavali River]], deep in the [[Kodar Mountains]].


## History

> The temple was constructed in [[-6401 AR]] by the [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Xanderghul]], with the help of the six other runelords.
> Followers of the Peacock Spirit were expected to make a pilgrimage to the Grand Temple at least once in their lives. Being a [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] [[Illusion|illusionist]], Xanderghul was forbidden from using [[Magic/Conjuration|conjuration]] [[Magic|magic]] (including [[Teleportation|teleportation]]), so he devised an [[Occult ritual|occult ritual]] known as the viridian transference, which allowed high-ranking members of the cult to teleport directly to the Grand Temple.


## Description

> Despite its altitude, the temple is a comfortable habitat year-round. Seven stone [[Peacock|peacock]] statues known as *Peacock Shrines*, one for each colour of the rainbow, grant some form of defence to the temple's inhabitants.
> The Grand Temple of the Peacock Spirit consists of an above-ground cathedral and several underground levels:

The Nave of Indigo Decadence
Home to the temple's permanent residents, and where official services were held for sufficiently large pilgrimages.
The Dungeon of Fiery Fury
A jail holding criminals, heretics, and those who got too close to knowing the Peacock Spirit's secret true identity as Xanderghul. The prison is staffed by a group of [[Asura|asuras]] [[Binding outsiders|bound]] by Xanderghul to serve as wardens and torturers.
The Vault of Crimson Longing
A facility off-limits to the asuras and cultists, where Xanderghul's [[Shadow giant|shadow giant]] assistant Tuirziaz broke [[Giant|giants]] into mewling [[Slave|slaves]].
The Refuge of Violet Vanity
Xanderghul's private chambers, where no one except he and his shadow servants were allowed. Its true purpose is to hold the violet *Peacock Shrine*, which would instantly create a new shadow body for his [[Soul|soul]] to inhabit should he be killed. He never had to make use of this contingency during the lifetime of Thassilon, but it proved its usefulness when [[Alaznist]] awakened and killed him in [[4717 AR]].
