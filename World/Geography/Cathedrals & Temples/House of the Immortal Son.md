> **The House of the Immortal Son** is one of two original temples to [[Aroden]] in [[Oppara]] (the other being the [[Basilica of the Last Man]]). Both temples still stand today. The sleek [[Azlanti]] architecture with elegant marble, granite, and numerous decorative pillars makes the House of the Immortal Son [[Taldor|Taldors]] most extravagant [[Opera|opera]] house, which has been its use since Aroden's death. Aroden's [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] can still be seen on its roof.


## Architecture

> The opulence of the interior decorations and detailing is unparalleled, with gilding to the point of excess, rich carpeting, [[Silk|silk]] coverings, oversized candelabras, and chandeliers. The grand former temple is a windowless circle 190 feet in diameter. In addition to the large grand auditorium, stage, and backstage areas, there are six entrances:

> - The northern Green entrance, with fewer opulent appointments and a light green carpet, is reserved for commoners.
> - To the northeast, furthest from the stage, is the banquet hall entrance. This entrance is for wealthy non-nobles to enter the house.
> - To the east is the Blue entrance. Its white marbled floor and dark blue carpet are reserved for nobles, but it is not used by the royal court.
> - To the southeast is the bar, also known as the **Immortal Drunk**. It serves patrons before performances and during intermissions, and hosts innumerable after-performance parties. The red carpet entrance is reserved for wealthy people outside of the nobility.
> - To the south, closest to stage right, is the gaudy Violet entrance. Its deep violet carpet is reserved for the [[Stavian III]] and his royal court.
> - To the west is the White entrance, also known as the Actor's Door, which is marked by granite pillars and a filthy carpet. According to tradition, the century-old carpet must never be cleaned or replaced lest it bring ruin to the house.
> The House of the Immortal Son is built atop the [[Chamber of the Stone]], an underground room that contained the *[[Zyphus Stone]]*, an ancient [[World/Items & Equipment/Artifacts/Artifact|artifact]] of [[Zyphus]] that predates the founding of Taldor. [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] descendants sealed it under a heavy capstone more than 6,000 years ago when Oppara was nothing more than a simple fishing village. Since it was first discovered in [[4708 AR]], the *Zyphus Stone* has been removed and now is held by the [[Pathfinder Society]] in [[Absalom]].
