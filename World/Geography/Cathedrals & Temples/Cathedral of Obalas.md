> The **Cathedral of Obalas** is a massive structure inhabited the ancient [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]], Obalas. Hundreds of years ago, he angered basically every major player in the nearby capital of [[Chillblight]], who declared him a renegade and forced him to flee. Together with his [[Air elemental|air]] and [[Ice elemental|ice elemental]] [[Slavery|slaves]], they settled here and built this cathedral, where he still lives today.
