> The **Burned Church** was a small church of [[Iomedae]] just south of the small town of [[Trunau]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. The church was serving the local communities. When [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]]'s army retreated and Trunau made the decision to stand and fight, the priests of Iomedae refused to abandon the church. Head priest [[Arthuris Bain]] and his two assistants were confident that Iomedae would protect them against the [[Orc|orc]] raiders. Though they fought bravely the church was burned to the ground by the rampaging orcs and the priests were slain. The church stood as a burned-out husk for many years. 
> In [[4663 AR]], the church was hastily reconstructed to hold the victims of a [[Disease|plague]] sweeping through Trunau but the structure burned down just a few days after its completion by a mysterious fire, killing a large number of patients. Today the site, known as both the Burned Church and **the Plague House**, is left alone.
