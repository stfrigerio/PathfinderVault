> [[Absalom]]'s **Temple of the Shining Star**, located near the street ringing the pit around the [[Starstone Cathedral]], is the largest temple of [[Sarenrae]] north of the [[Katheer|capital]] of [[Qadira]], and the only such church in [[Absalom]]. The church runs several pavilions for junior priests to minister the public for free, and devotees travel to the church at least once a month. Paladins of the goddess, especially those from Taldor, are trained in fighting with the scimitar, medicine, and the [[Human languages of GolarionKelesh|Kelesh language]] skills necessary to read the [[List of written worksBirth of Light and Truth|holy book]] of the goddess.
> The temple is lead by Scion Lady [[Xerashir of House Shamyyid]], Bey of Sarenrae, who greets the dawn every morning at the Mark, the world's largest sundial.
