> The enormous **Besmara's Temple** is located on the mythical [[Holy Isle]] which stands at the center of the [[Cove of the Queen]], the beautiful cove in the [[Besmara's Throne|Besmaras Throne]] island in the [[Shackles]]. Half of the temple is submerged in the Holy Isle's tiny bay. Priests and acolytes in black [[Silk|silk]] work in the temple, performing ceremonies and welcoming those that end their [[Voyage Besmara|Voyage]] there. An old woman, [[Laharra Seaspray]], the current high priest of Besmara is always found within the temple.
