> **Cathedral of Saint Clydwell** is located in the center of the [[Old Kenabres]] district of the [[Mendev|Mendevian]] city of [[Kenabres]]. The great stone temple honors the [[Iomedae|Iomedaean]] champion Saint Clydwell, who died sealing a horde of [[Demon|demons]] into an inescapable prison.



## Description

> The cathedral features a green copper steeple and stained-glass windows depicting various terrible demons being imprisoned.


## Functions

> The cathedral is used primarily for important events, services, and gatherings, such as blessings of [[Crusader|crusaders]] leaving for the battlefronts against the [[Worldwound]]. It is also a site of [[Healing|healing]] for the grievously wounded, and a vendor of items used in resurrections. The smaller [[Temple of Iomedae Kenabres|Temple of Iomedae]] provides everyday services.


## Clergy

> Nestrin Alodae is officially in charge of both the cathedral and the [[Temple of Iomedae Kenabres|Temple of Iomedae]], but experienced demon-hunter and priest Eterrius Sunnestier takes on most of the cathedral's leadership duties.
