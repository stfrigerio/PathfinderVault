> The wooden **Deadeye Lodge** is the city of [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] church of [[Erastil]], and is located in the northeast of the [[Keystone]] district on the edge of [[Seerspring Garden]]. Looking more like a rustic hunting cabin, Deadeye Lodge seems quite out of place among the townhouses of the city, but that does not seem to bother the devotees of [[Erastil|Old Deadeye]], who attend in large numbers. Its head priest, [[Lorgell Fendus|Father Lorgell Fendus]], holds services three times-a-week, and is known for his welcoming nature. The Lodge also hosts a dozen archers who serve their god by keeping the streets of Keystone safe for all. This brings them into occasional conflict with the similarly armed followers of [[Calistria|Calistrias]] [[Dome of the Savored Sting]], whose methods and morals while maintaining the peace are quite different.
