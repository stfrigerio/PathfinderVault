> The **Pure Temple of the Maharajah** is built over the spring that is the source of the [[River Sald]] in the small eastern hills of [[Jalmeray]]. The structure is white and gold and is maintained by bound [[Genie|genies]] and a huge number of [[Slavery|slaves]] and their duty-bound overseers. The temple is dedicated to [[Khiben-Sald]], the ancient ruler who founded Jalmeray. Every four years, thousands of people make their way up the Sald from the city of [[Niswan]] to pay respects to his memory. Even though the maharajah is not buried here (and some claim that he is still alive), the people treat the Pure Temple as if it was his final resting place.
