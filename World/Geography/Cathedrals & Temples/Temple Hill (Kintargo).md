> The **Temple Hill** district is the highest point on [[Argo Isle]] side of [[Kintargo]] and houses almost all of the city's religious buildings.


## History

> The district is wedged between the districts of [[Redroof]] to the east and south and [[Jarvis End]] to the west. Temple Hill centres around what is now the [[Temple of Asmodeus Kintargo|Temple of Asmodeus]] but was originally devoted to the [[God]] of [[Human|Humanity]], [[Aroden]]. Sat at the top of Temple Hill, this temple was the first to be built and has a commanding view overlooking the entire city. After its construction many other religions followed suit and built their temples across the hill's slope.
> The coming of [[House Thrune]] changed all this, and now only a small handful of religions other than the dominant [[Asmodeus|Asmodean]] faith are allowed to remain, and they are heavily taxed. The remaining temples include the unpopular [[Shadowsquare]] devoted to [[Zon-Kuthon]], the bank-like [[Abadar|Abadaran]] temple known as the [[House of Golden Veils]], and the only church devoted to a righteous deity, [[Shelyn|Shelyns]] [[Songbird Hall]]. This limited religious freedom is more than most of [[Cheliax]] is allowed and has helped curb the outright rebellion that always seemed to simmer just beneath the surface of Kintargan society.
