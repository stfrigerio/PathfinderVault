> The **City of the Departed** is an area in the [[Godsward]] district of [[Armun Kelisk]] devoted to minor [[Deity|deities]] and ancient ancestors of the [[Djinn|djinn]]. While the djinn have limitless lifespans, they can still be killed and the City of the Departed serves as reminder to Armun Kelisk residents of this, as well as serving as a tangible link with the heroes and legends of djinni culture's past.
