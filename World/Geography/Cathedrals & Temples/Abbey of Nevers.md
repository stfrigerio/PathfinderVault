> The **Abbey of Nevers** is the sprawling sanctuary of the [[Velstrac demagogue|velstrac demagogue]] [[Aroggus]] on the [[Shadow Plane]], originally established by him as a place where the [[Velstrac|velstracs]] could hide forever after their exodus from [[Hell]]. The Abbey of Nevers constantly unfolds and reconfigures itself, and the maze of strange [[Demiplane|demiplanes]] within it can drive any invader [[Insanity|insane]]. While most velstracs have left the Abbey of Nevers, no longer afraid of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Devil|devils]], Aroggus remained and long ago discarded his physical body, merging his essence with the Abbey of Nevers, turning it into, essentially, his entrails, and inhabiting a suit of [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] whenever he needs to leave.
