 Norgorber's [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]].
> **Blackfingers Temple** is the primary place of worship to [[Norgorber]] in the city of [[Absalom]] and is the only known place of worship that exclusively reveres Norgorber's Blackfingers aspect. Although the clergy maintains a façade of legitimacy it is an open secret that the clergy secretly engage in torture and [[Poison|poison]] brewing in the temple's lower levels.



## Description

## Temple services

> The Noxious Retort is a two week conference of the [[Alchemy|alchemical]] arts that is held annually at the temple. The event attracts a great number of [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemists]] and poisoners keen to make social connections and learn new skills.
