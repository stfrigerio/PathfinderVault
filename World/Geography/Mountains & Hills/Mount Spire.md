> At almost 16,500 feet, **Mount Spire** is the highest peak in the [[Menador Mountains]]. The [[Veil of the Spire]] falls more than 300 feet into a large pool that is the origin of the [[Yolubilis River]]. [[Bellezeph Villa]] caters to an elite clientele of tourists who come to admire the falls, try out their mountaineering skills, or engage in amateur spelunking. Behind the falls are extensive networks of caves, home to cave fishers, chardas, goblins, and kobolds.
