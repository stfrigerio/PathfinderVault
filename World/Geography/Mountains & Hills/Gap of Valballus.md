> The **Gap of Valballus** is a wide, low mountain pass that connects the [[Hold of Belkzen]] to [[Ustalav]] to the east. It runs between the [[Tusk Mountains]] to the north and the [[Hungry Mountains]] to the south. [[Orc]] raiders traverse the Gap to sack the Ustalavic settlements in [[Canterwall]]. [[Varisia|Varisian]] caravans and merchants also use the pass heading to or from [[Urgir]].
