> **Droskar's Crag** is an active volcano located in northern [[Andoran]], in the region known as [[Darkmoon Vale]]. Part of the [[Five Kings Range]] (although not claimed by the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] nation of the [[Five Kings Mountains]]), the mountain consists of two primary peaks known as the Hammer and the Anvil; the Hammer reaches 28,822 feet in altitude, while the Anvil—which hosts the active crater known as Rovagug's Caldera—is 28,305 feet tall and grows by about 1 1/2 feet per year. These heights make Droskar's Crag the tallest known active volcano on [[Golarion]] and the Five Kings Range's tallest mountain.
> Several rivers originate or are fed from glaciers on the Crag, including the [[Coldforge River]] (from the Coldforge glacier), the Slagiron River (from the Slagiron glacier), and the [[Goldmelt River]] (from the Gold glacier). The crag also hosts the East Gold, Sunset, Silver, Peakcrest, Eastrise, and Deaddrop glaciers.
> The volcano last erupted in [[3980 AR]] in a massive explosion known as the [[Rending]], which transformed the entire region. At the time, Droskar's Crag was known as **Torag's Crag**, though its name was changed to reflect the more hostile nature of the volcano since that time (the evil dwarven god [[Droskar]] is the patron of endless toil and suffering). To date, it has shown no major activity, though the peaks constantly spew ash and smoke into the air as a constant reminder of the threat that exists beneath the snow-capped mountain.
