> The **Brazen Peaks**, a mountain range in northern [[Garund]], stretch from the [[Kho-Rarne Pass]] to the [[Obari Ocean]], creating a natural border between the nations of [[Osirion]] and [[Katapesh]].


## Locations

> The tallest mountain of the range is [[Mount Osiki]]. The range also hosts the headwaters of both the [[Asp River|Asp]] and [[Crook River|Crook Rivers]] and is thus the source of most of the water in Osirion.
> Land near their foothills is believed by some to be the locus that birthed bronzeworking, although a number of metallurgists from other nations dispute that claim.
> The [[Eyes of the Bronze Man]], twin mines, one drawing tin and the other copper, sit adjacent halfway up the side of one mountain the range. That mountain's face was later shaped into the likeness of [[Djederet I]], under his direction and the mountain came to be known as the [[Face of the Bronze Man]].
> [[Djederet I]] may have built an elaborate tomb deep within a played-out mine in this range, but that tomb, if it ever existed, has not been discovered, and he was buried elsewhere.


## Denizens

> An unusual number of [[Ifrit|ifrits]] hail from the Brazen Peaks area, a phenomenon possibly related to [[Xotani|Xotani the Firebleeder]], whose remains are held within these mountains.
