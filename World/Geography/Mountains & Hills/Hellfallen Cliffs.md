> The **Hellfallen Cliffs** in the eastern edge of the [[Shattered Range]] are as much a part of the city-state of [[Alkenstar]] as are any of its man-made structures.  [[Alkenstar City]] is built atop the 700-foot-tall escarpment where the [[Ustradi River]] creates the [[Alken Falls]] on its way to the sea.  The town of [[Martel]] stands at the bottom of the Falls, its two immense towers stretching above the cliffs' rim and connecting via skybrige with the upper city.  Into the the rock face itself rests the impressive bombard known as the [[Great Maw of Rovagug]] forever standing guard across the magic-blasted desert of the [[Mana Wastes]].
