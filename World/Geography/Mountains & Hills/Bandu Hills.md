The **Bandu Hills** stretch from [[Desperation Bay]] on the coast of [[Sargava]] eastwards into the heart of the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. Sargava claims the western part of the hills. The hills can get very hot; average summer daytime temperature is 110 °F, reaching as much as 120 °F at midday. Even in winter, temperatures vary between 75 °F and 90 °F. Temperatures can fall by as much as 30 °F at night.
> The hills are named after the [[Bandu]], a typically bloodthirsty tribe of [[Bekyar]].
> The hills have a bad reputation, being rumoured to be inhabited by restless spirits and angry [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Undead|undead]], as well as the warped descendants of forgotten peoples. However, the veins of [[Gold|gold]], emeralds, and sapphires that lie beneath the hills attract prospectors.



## Sites


### Arzikal

> [[Arzikal]], also known as the City of Hungry Spires, is a ruin that appears to have been ripped apart and stacked into spires by an angry [[Deity|god]].


### Barkskin Lake

> At certain times of the year, the waters of [[Barkskin Lake]] in the western hills have [[Magic|magical]] properties. When conditions are right, the water is said to temporarily toughen the skin of those who drink it, giving it the appearance and consistency of tree bark.


### Farsouth Mine

> The [[Farsouth Mine]] is a site close to the border between Sargava and the Mwangi Expanse.


### Mines of Deeptreasure

> The [[Deeptreasure Mining Company]] has a hidden base, the [[Mines of Deeptreasure]], somewhere on the edge of the hills.


### Mount Nakyuk

> Mount Nakyuk is the highest point in the Bandu Hills.


### Stasis Fields

> Deep within the hills lies the entrance to the [[Stasis Fields]], a massive underground prison complex discovered in [[4516 AR]].


## Inhabitants

> [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dwarf|Dwarves]] from [[Janderhoff]] began mining the hills for valuable [[Metal|metals]] in [[4158 AR]], and they were followed by [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Gnome|gnomes]] searching for [[Gemstone|gemstones]]. Between [[4189 AR]] and [[4199 AR]], the dwarves disappeared without a trace. Since then, fighting has broken out in the hills between the different groups of prospectors on numerous occasions. The bestial [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Undead|undead]] known as [[Namorrodor|namorrodors]] are known to haunt the parts of the Bandu Hills that are coterminous with the [[Shadow Plane]].
