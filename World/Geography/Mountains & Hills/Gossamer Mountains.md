> The **Gossamer Mountains** are a huge mountain range that forms the western reaches of [[Shenmen]] where it meets [[Shokuro]]. 
> The Gossamer Mountains' most notorious residents are the [[Bestiary/Jorogumo|jorogumos]], predatory [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spider]]-women who haunt the mountain range's desolate peaks and valleys. Just as infamous are the Path Maidens, cursed undead that abandoned their faith in [[Pharasma]] at the moment of their deaths and now haunt the mountains in search of the living. Curiously, it seems that the Path Maidens and the jorogumo have some understanding with each other, or perhaps the jorogumo may have devised strategies for evading them.
> Shenmen's capital of [[Yin-Sichasi]] lies in the northern reaches of the Gossamer Mountains.
