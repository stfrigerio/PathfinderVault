> **Aroden's Eye** is a rocky mountain with a circular hole 150 feet wide in the northeastern [[World's Edge Mountains|Worlds Edge Mountains]] of [[Taldor]], east of the [[Thousand Relics Pass]]. It was named due to the similarity between its shape and [[Aroden|Arodens]] [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]], and was a frequent pilgrimage site for Arodenites, enough to support a small monastery consisting of twelve structures connected by rope bridges and narrow stairways.
> After Aroden's death, the pilgrimages stopped, tithes no longer came, and the now-powerless [[Cleric|clerics]] of Aroden abandoned the temple, except the old, bitter Leomaris Gurgin, who converted to the worship of [[Groetus]]. The desecrated temple has since then been inhabited by the Last Acolytes, a clan of [[Harpy|harpies]] whom Gurgin converted to his new faith, and a handful of [[Lunar naga|lunar nagas]] who serve as their [[Astrologer|astrologers]]. They sacrifice captives and recklessly [[Summon|summon]] murderous [[Protean|proteans]], attracting [[Redcap|redcaps]] and [[Animate dream|animate dreams]] in the process. Travellers report nightmares, with eerily similar descriptions of the mountain and a howling [[Moon Golarion|moon]].
