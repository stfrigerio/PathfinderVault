> The **Aspodell Mountains** form the western border between [[Andoran]] and its rival [[Cheliax]]. Unlike the [[Five Kings Mountains]] north of Andoran, the Aspodells are not a particularly tall range, but their highest peaks are known to reach above 9,000 feet. The mountains' rugged slopes form a substantial border between Andoran and Cheliax, with only one easy pass, the [[Aspodell Pass]], overlooked by the walled town of [[Piren's Bluff|Pirens Bluff]]. As the [[Iron|iron-rich]] mountains are claimed by both neighboring nations, Andoran maintains a military presence in Aspodell Pass as well, although the rest of the mountains are lightly inhabited, monster-infested, and not known to hold significant mineral wealth.



## History

> The Aspodell Mountains were the sight of an entire military campaign, termed the Aspodell Campaign, fought during [[Taldor|Taldors]] expansionist wars. After the [[Fourth Army of Exploration]] had cleared the lowlands and created the Taldan province of Andoran in [[1707 AR]], the local [[Kellid]] tribes living in the Aspodell Mountains continued resisting the invaders for more than 400 years. Attacks from these mountain nations continued until [[2133 AR]], when the [[Seventh Army of Exploration]] defeated the most powerful Kellid tribe opposing Taldor's rule, the [[Isgeri]].
