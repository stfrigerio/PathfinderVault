> The **Wyvern Mountains**, on central [[Varisia]]'s [[Storval Plateau]], are located between the [[Storval Deep]] to the west and the [[Cinderlands]] to the east.  They got their name from a simple fact: the mountains are home to the [[Poison|poisonous]], winged relatives of the [[Dragon|dragons]]: the [[Wyvern|wyvern]].  The mountains are also home to plentiful packs of wild [[Goat|goats]], [[Sheep|sheep]] and llamas—the primary food sources for the wyverns—and also more dangerous foes such as [[Red reaver|red reavers]], and [[Storm roc|storm rocs]].
