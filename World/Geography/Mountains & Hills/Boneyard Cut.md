> The **Boneyard Cut** connects the city of [[Riddleport]] with the city's [[Boneyard Riddleport|Boneyard]]. Climbing over Riddleport's eastern ridge, this pass ascends almost 200 feet at a near-45-degree angle. Garbage is carried over this pass on mule-drawn carts. At the end of this path is a sheer cliff and the caretaker's hut. The caretaker, [[Hyram Crooge]], maintains a constant bonfire for the burning of some trash and dumps the rest over the cliff edge into the Boneyard below.
