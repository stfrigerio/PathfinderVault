*This article covers the mountain on [[Rivenrake Island]]. For the comic book series, see [[Hollow Mountain comics]].*
> **Hollow Mountain** is among the highest peaks of [[Rivenrake Island]] in the [[Varisian Gulf]]. It boasts one of the most intriguing [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] ruins in [[Varisia]]. Near the summit of the mountain, an enormous carving of a woman's face looks sternly towards the south, half of her visage rent away by an ancient apocalypse; she looks over the ruins of the bridge that, in ancient times, spanned from Rivenrake to Argavist Island. Exposed underneath, the onlooker can see that countless corridors and rooms must honeycomb the entire mountain.
> At its foot, lie the aged ruins of what some scholars believe to be the city of [[Xin-Bakrakhan]], the Thassilonian City of Wrath, and once the capital of the domain of [[Bakrakhan]]. These ruins are said to be one of the few remnants of this mountainous realm which disappeared into the Varisian Gulf following the destruction of the empire in [[-5293 AR]]. The split face near the summit is conjectured to be that of [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Alaznist]] herself.
> Hollow Mountain was built with the labor of [[Slavery|enslaved]] [[Rune giant|rune]] and [[Stone giant|stone giants]].


> [[Paizo]] published a major article about Hollow Mountain in chapter 3 of *[[Dungeons of Golarion]]*, and set the adventure *[[It Came from Hollow Mountain]]* there. [[Dynamite Entertainment]] published an official comics series set there titled *[[Hollow Mountain comics|Hollow Mountain]]*.
