They begin in the [[Orc|orc]] [[Hold of Belkzen]], running in a generally northern direction into the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] all the way to the tundra at the northern reaches of Avistan. They form part of the border between the Hold of Belkzen and [[Ustalav]] in the southern reaches and the entire border between the Hold and the [[Worldwound]] further north.
> Despite their many dangers, the Tusk Mountains are known for their many passes. The range divides the Realm of the Mammoth Lords in half, separating the snowy west from the warmer east. The Tusk Mountains are home to numerous [[Frost giant|frost giants]] ruled by [[Gnargorak|Jarl Gnargorak]].
