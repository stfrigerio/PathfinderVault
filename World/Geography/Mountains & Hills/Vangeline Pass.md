> The **Vangeline Pass** in the [[Shattered Range]] provides entrance into a remote portion of western [[Geb's Rest]] from the eastern [[Mwangi Expanse]]. It is one of the three major passes from the Mwangi Expanse to the east: [[Kho-Rarne Pass]], the [[Ndele Gap]], and the Vangeline Pass. The pass is rarely used because there no major cities in the eastern Mwangi Expanse close to the Vangeline Pass and also the usual dangers of the mountains and the jungles are augmented by monsters migrating south from the [[Mana Wastes]], or dragging themselves out of Draxmere, as well as monsters from the [[Axanir River]] to the south.
