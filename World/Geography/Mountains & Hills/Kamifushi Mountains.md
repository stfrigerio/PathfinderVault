> The **Kamifushi Mountains** are a range of mountains that run down the southern length of the [[Ikkaku Peninsula]] in northern [[Minkai]]. The Kamifushi are rich in minerals and many of the peninsula's residents make their living mining these geological riches. The Kamifushi Mountains are also home to a large number of hot springs, many of which boast [[Healing|healing]] properties. These springs often have an accompanying temple to either [[Desna]], [[Kofusachi]], or [[Qi Zhong]]. Unlike in many other locations, the residents of Ikkaku Peninsula have never attempted to make any profit from these healing hot springs.
> In the north of the Kamifushi range sits [[Mount Kumijinja]], one of the volcanos known as the Three Fires. Mount Kumijinja also has an entrance to the [[Darklands]] layer of [[Nar-Voth]], known as the [[Ghost Path]], within its caldera. In [[470 AR]], [[Ishanda Aiko|General Ishanda Aiko]] led an expedition along the Ghost Path. There were almost no survivors after Ishanda's army stumbled upon the outskirts of the [[Oni|oni]] city of [[Shirogoku]].
