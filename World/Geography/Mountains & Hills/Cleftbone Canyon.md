> The **Cleftbone Canyon** is located in the north-easternmost spur of the [[Kodar Mountains]]. The city of [[Wyvernsting]] lies at the canyon's southern mouth. The tunnels and chambers that honeycomb the walls of the Cleftbone Canyon are home to the [[Wyvern|wyvern-riders]] of the [[Wingripper tribe]] of [[Orc|orcs]], close allies of the [[Murdered Child tribe]].
