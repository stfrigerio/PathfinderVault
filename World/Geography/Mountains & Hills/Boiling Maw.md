> **Boiling Maw** is a rift that seems to bore into the very depths of [[Golarion]] in the south of the [[Vudra|Vudran]] region of [[Open Bridge]]. While most of the Open Bridge region is covered in rifts that split the earth and disgorge hordes of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aberration|aberrations]], Boiling Maw seems to be one of the most active of these rifts.
