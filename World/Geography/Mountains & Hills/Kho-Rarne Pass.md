> The gap between the [[Barrier Wall]] mountains and the [[Brazen Peaks]] is known as the **Kho-Rarne Pass**. It links the northeastern [[Mwangi Expanse]], near the [[Ruins of Kho]], to [[Osirion]], near to the [[Ruins of Rarne]]. The pass is wide and easily traveled, but due to Osirion's lack of interest in the Mwangi region, it is rarely used.
