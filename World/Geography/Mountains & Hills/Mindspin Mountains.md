> The **Mindspin Mountains** are a range of mountains that begin on the [[Storval Plateau]] in eastern [[Varisia]] and stretch south for several hundred miles before petering out north of the [[Menador Mountains]].


## Geography

> As a natural barrier, they form the border between several nations. In the south, the mountains form the western border of [[Nirmathas]] and separate dark [[Nidal]] and [[Molthune]]. In the north, they form the border between Varisia and the [[Hold of Belkzen]], Nirmathas and Nidal.


## Inhabitants

> The northern section of the Mindspin Mountains, particularly between Varisia and the Hold of Belkzen, is considered a death-trap to all but the most experienced explorers. They are filled with [[Giant|giants]] (including [[Fire giant|fire giants]]), [[Ogre|ogres]], [[Troll|trolls]], and all other manner of dangerous beasts. The abundance of such unpleasant life may be one of the reasons that the Mindspin Mountains form such an effective border between the two nations. The [[Broken Spine tribe|Broken Spine]] [[Orc|orc]] tribe occupy an abandoned keep in the eastern foothills of the Mindspin Mountains within the Hold of Belkzen.
> The mountains are also populated by [[Dwarf|dwarves]]—mostly trappers and miners—who have settlements in the area. They explore the mountains, eager to uncover evidence of their old ancestral homes. Troops from nearby [[Janderhoff]] also patrol the region in an effort to ensure the security of locations that interest them, such as [[Crystalrock]].
> The central reaches of Mindspin Mountains near the [[Bloodsworn Vale]] are inhabited by the [[Flame drake|flame drakes]] who escaped the taming of the Vale in [[4707 AR]]. These violent [[Dragon|draconic]] creatures have begun conspiring with both giants and evil [[Fey|fey]] to wreak a terrible vengeance on the Bloodsworn Vale's civilised inhabitants.
> The southern tip of the mountain range, between the nations of Nidal and Molthune, is home to [[Tintavex]], a unique [[Half-dragon|half-dragon]] [[Griffon|griffon]] born from a [[Magic|magical]] accident. The range is also home to the [[Juggerloathe]], the hellish spawn of a [[Bulette|bulette]] and [[Lamashtu|Lamashtus]] divine herald [[Yethazmari]] that has menaced the regions for centuries, sometimes regurgitating its victims as terrifying [[Undead|undead]] [[Bodak|bodaks]].
