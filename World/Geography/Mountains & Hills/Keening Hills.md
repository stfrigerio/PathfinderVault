> The **Keening Hills** are a haunted highlands to the east of the [[Kodar Mountains]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. Found just southeast of the treacherous [[Dirt Sea]], the Keening Hills seem green and inviting, yet are stringently avoided by even the bravest [[Orc|orcs]] of that land. They say that whatever lies dreaming beneath its surface, should be left to its slumber. Those few who have ventured there and returned to tell the tale, speak of hearing songs that drive one towards suicide or call one to explore its trackless expanse. Fortune hunters looking for burial treasure in its barrow mounds find that holes dug quickly fill with tar and close up with unnatural speed.
