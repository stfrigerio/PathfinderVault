> The **Zho Mountains** run through [[Qadira]], splitting the nation almost in half. They form an effective barrier, not due to their size (averaging a modest 7,500 feet), but because of the large number of feral beasts, [[Dragon|draconic monsters]] and [[Elemental|elemental outcasts]] that live within the often volcanic caverns. Rumours of hidden communities consisting of [[Ifrit|ifrits]], [[Oread|oreads]], [[Sylph|sylphs]] and [[Undine|undines]] persist, but none of yet been discovered by explorers, leading to theories that such societies are concealed by [[Illusion|illusion]] magics. In Qadira, the range is divided into northern and southern regions.

## Inhabitants

> Bands of charmed and bribed [[Ogre|ogres]], semi-loyal to Qadira, roam the mountains. Their main objective is to destroy [[Taldan]] patrols, although they are just as likely to attack anyone who is obviously not a loyal [[Kelesh|Keleshite]] or Qadiran soldier.
> Aside from the dangers of the mountains, small Qadiran communities dot the mountain valleys, and are ideal grounds for growing grains.
