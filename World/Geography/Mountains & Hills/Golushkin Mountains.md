> The **Golushkin Mountains** form part of [[Brevoy]]'s border with [[Numeria]], and are located in what was the original kingdom of [[Issia]] before Brevoy became united.
> The mountains are filled with a great deal of natural resources, such as [[Iron|iron]], nickel, copper, [[Silver|silver]], and tin. The resources are mined by the [[Golka]] clan of [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who lived in the dwarven city of [[Golushkin]]. [[House Garess]] has a good relationship with the dwarves, working the metal that they mine, and has built several strongholds, including [[Highdelve]] and [[Grayhaven]], in the mountains beside the dwarves.
