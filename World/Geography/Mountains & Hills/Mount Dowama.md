> The great **Mount Dowama** towers above the [[Screaming Jungle]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. Its snowcapped summit is visible through every break in the tree cover and the jungle's natives revere it as a holy place. Foreigners, meanwhile, often see the mountain as a challenge to be climbed and reach the summit. These clashing viewpoints have led to cold diplomatic relations and other interactions between the two groups.
> It is located on the south-eastern side of the jungle and access to it is extremely difficult. Legends speak that the ruins of the [[Shory]] city of [[Ulduvai]] are hidden somewhere within an isolated vale.


## Inhabitants

> A number of different peoples live on or near the mountain that are found nowhere else outside of the Mwangi Expanse. These include zothians, who have the heads and torsos of [iruxi|iruxis]] and four-legged lower halves, and the winged [[Gorilla|gorilla]] [[Derhii|derhiis]]. Rumors persist throughout the Mwangi of more chaotic monsters as well.
