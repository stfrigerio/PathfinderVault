> The World's Edge Mountains are mountains that separate eastern [[Taldor]], and indeed [[Avistan]] from the [[Whistling Plains]] of [[Casmaron]]. It is divided into two long ranges, separated by the [[Porthmos Gap]].
> The Gouged Eye tribe dwells in caverns under the mountains. These savage [[Orc|orcs]] frequently clash with the Taldan military and are considered vicious even by orc standards.



## Northern range

> 
Ranging from the Porthmos Gap almost to [[Yanmass]], the northern half of the mountains are vast, jagged and snow-capped and considered generally impassable; they are the section described as the **World's Edge Mountains**, when describing the two ranges individually.


## Southern Range

> 
The **Southern Range** runs from the Porthmos Gap south and into [[Qadira]], and contains some of the tallest mountains on [[Golarion]], crossed only by the dangerous [[Emperor's Pass|Emperors Pass]] on cloud-shrouded [[Emperor's Peak|Emperors Peak]]. [[Mount Kaltafarr]], the tallest peak in [[Taldor]], can be found in the Southern Range. Until recently, the [[Great White Wyrm]], an ancient [[White dragon|white dragon]], threatened much of the region.
