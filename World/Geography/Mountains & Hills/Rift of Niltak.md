The **Rift of Niltak** is a mist-shrouded canyon found in the [[Red Mountains]] of north-eastern [[Varisia]]. No one knows what the origins of the rift are, but all agree that it is filled with all manner of strange flora and fauna. Gigantic insects and [[Centipede|centipede]] horrors can be seen crawling over [[Plant|plants]] found in no other place on [[Golarion]], and the echoes of shrieking [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Level 1/Bat|bat-like creatures]] reverberate off the glen's walls. 
> An accurate description of the rift has not come to light, as those who enter either never return, go [[Insane|insane]], or commit suicide shortly after emerging from it.
