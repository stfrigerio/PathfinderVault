> The **Fogscar Mountains** are a coastal range in central [[Varisia]], bordered by the [[Varisian Gulf]] to the west and the [[Churlwood]] to the east.  It is a wild region inhabited by countless bands of [[Goblin|goblins]] who constantly fight amongst themselves over control of territory and resources.  Those few travelers who do brave the narrow roads, perhaps as a shortcut from [[Magnimar]] to [[Roderic's Cove|Roderics Cove]], are strongly advised to carry trinkets to pay off the scavenging natives.  In [[4707 AR]], [[Giant|giants]] of the [[Storval Plateau]] used the mountains as a blind to enter central Varisia undetected in a failed invasion attempt.
