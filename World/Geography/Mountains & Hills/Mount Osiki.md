> **Mount Osiki** is the tallest mountain within the range of [[Brazen Peaks]] in northern [[Garund]]. Its foothills and smaller peaks extend almost to the [[Crook River]].
> An ancient stairway begins from a stone landing on the southern bank of the Crook, winding through the foothills and the peaks and ends at the top of the mountain. An ancient shrine to a forgotten god sits at the very peak of the mountain. The few people that climb the ancient stairway each year are rumored to have committed to the pilgrimage after being saved from death or ruin by a dark-cloaked stranger. Nothing is known about what happens at the shrine as the pilgrims returning from the top of Mount Osiki do not talk about it under any inducement.
