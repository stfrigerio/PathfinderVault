> The **Stormspear Mountains** lie on the northern edge of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], dividing it from the eternal ice of the [[Crown of the World]]. The mountains within the boundaries of the kingdom are broken into two sections: the western, which borders the [[Steaming Sea]], and the eastern, where it runs into the massive [[Winterwall Glacier]]. Between them lie the similarly-named [[Stormspear Hills]].
