> **Emperor's Peak**, sometimes called **Emperor Peak**, is the highest mountain in the [[Five Kings Mountains]] region, towering 18,365 feet above sea level. Deep in the heart of the mountain is the great dwarven city of [[Highhelm Militia]]. Note that the Emperor's Peak is not the tallest peak in the [[Five Kings Range]], only the tallest in the area controlled by the dwarves; [[Droskar's Crag|Droskars Crag]] in [[Andoran]] tops it at 28,822 feet.
