**The Lurching Mountain** is a towering [[Volcano|volcano]] on [[Raugsmauda's Reach|Raugsmaudas Reach]] island in the [[Shackles]]. The volcano is the primary source of the yellow-gray clouds that loom over the island. Thick fumes always pour out of its crater at the top of the mountain and roll down its sides. The resulting ash looks rotten and it is unknown what chemical composition could create such a unique and unsettling ash cloud. It is said that the [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] [[Raugsmauda]] practices her foul [[Magic|magic]] on the top of the volcano.
