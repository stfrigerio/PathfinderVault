> The **Ghorcha Pass**, or **Ghorcha Passage**, is a rugged and hilly valley primarily in the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Amaans]], but also spreading into [[Virlych]]. The area is located in the [[Hungry Mountains]], but with higher mountains on the western and eastern side, traveling north or south through the Ghorcha Pass is relatively easier than trekking through the harsh mountains.
> Despite this, few are willing to travel there as it is believed that the valley is haunted by strange whispers and hunting [[Undead|undead]]. Such rumours are passionately spread by the local populace of Amaans, and the supposed dangers are the lingering legacy of the imprisoned [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] in Virlych.
