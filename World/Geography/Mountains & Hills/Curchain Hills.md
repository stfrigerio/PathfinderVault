> The **Curchain Hills** are grassy uplands located in central [[Varisia]] between the [[Stony Mountains]] and the [[Iron Peaks]]. The [[Storval Rise]] forms their northern border, and both the [[Lampblack River|Lampblack]] and [[Chavali River|Chavali Rivers]] flow through it on their way south.  The terrain is generally pleasant, with rolling hills and dells appearing with almost planned symmetry. Great herds of [[Aurochs|aurochs]] graze here, and both the peaceful [[Shoanti]] [[ShoantiTribes of the Shoanti|Clan of the Hawk]] and the more aggressive [[ShoantiTribes of the Shoanti|Wind Clan]] claim this land as their own.
> The Floating Sphere of Mauffrey, a massive sphere of stone, flies over the Curchain Hills. Its path seems random though it never leaves an area some 100 miles in radius over the hills. [[Drake|Drakes]], [[Giant spider|giant spiders]], [[Bugbear|bugbears]], and other [[Goblinoid|goblinoid]] creatures have been known to make the Floating Sphere their homes.
