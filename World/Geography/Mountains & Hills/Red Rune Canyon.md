> **Red Rune Canyon**, located in the eastern [[Tusk Mountains]] of the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], is an interconnected maze of canyons tainted by the relentless expansion of the [[Worldwound]]. Festering black boils and sores weep red bloodlike mud from its walls. The canyons change form under the [[Demon|demonic]] influence, with blasphemous runes etched into Golarion's surface. The [[Evil|evil]] of Red Rune Canyon drives any living creature who enters it mad.
> [[Larisa]], a [[Tiefling|tiefling]] [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]], arrived to Red Rune Canyon in [[4713 AR]]. Using blasphemous sacrifices at each new [[Moon|moon]], she gained control of the glyphs inscribed by the canyon. Each sacrifice calls forth a new symbol and siphons power from the distant Worldwound. When she bends the canyon into her grand final rune, she will get rid of her [[Mortal|mortal]] blood and metamorphose into a full [[Demon|demon]].
> The reshaping of the Red Rune Canyon has weakened the barriers between Golarion and the [[Abyss]]. At each of Larisa's [[Ritual|rituals]], a new gate is forced open for a few seconds, oozing demons out into the Tusk Mountains.


## History

> A century ago saw the end of the canyon as a home for [[Taiga giant|taiga giants]] when Tanaq Mammoth-Eater led his tribe out of Red Rune Canyon due to the growing demonic taint.
