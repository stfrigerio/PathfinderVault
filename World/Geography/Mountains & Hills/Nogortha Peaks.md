> The **Nogortha Peaks** are a tiny, wooded mountain range found in southern [[Andoran]], just to the east of the [[Arthfell Forest]], and is home to rural hillfolk and other outcasts. The infamous barrow mounds called the [[Nogortha Necropolis]] is located in a small valley between it and the [[Arthfell Mountains]] to the south. The minor [[Arthrosh River]] (which flows past the city of [[Oregent]]) is said to begin in the foothills of the Nogortha.
