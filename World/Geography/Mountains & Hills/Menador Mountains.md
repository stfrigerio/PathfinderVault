> The **Menador Mountains** are one of the most prominent mountain ranges in southwestern [[Avistan]]. The range stretches westward from northern [[Isger]], forms the southern border of [[Molthune]] and [[Nidal]], and traverses [[Cheliax]] and [[Ravounel]] until they end at the [[Pillars of Anferita]] and the [[Arcadian Ocean]].



## Geography

> The mountains carry snow at their peaks year‑round but avalanches are a constant risk at lower altitudes due to partially melted snow. Some paths through the mountains do exist but even these are far from safe and often effectively one way due to cold weather hazards.


## Inhabitants

> These mountains are infested with [[Orc|orcs]], most notably the Severed Hand tribe. These orcs have traditionally menaced the region from western Cheliax all the way to the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] cities of the [[Five Kings Mountains]]. Another known tribe is the Shattered Fang, a group known both for their ferocity and their propensity for keeping oaths.
