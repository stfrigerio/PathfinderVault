> The **Mildanesi Mountains** are a huge range of mountains that runs from north to south across nearly the entire length of [[Arcadia]]. The northernmost parts are known as the Crownpeaks, after the Crowned Regents who once lived there. The nation of [[Xopatl]] is located in a valley in the middle of the Mildanesi Mountains, where a [[Meteoroid|meteorite]] that fell alongside the *[[Starstone]]* in [[-5293 AR]]. A great and flourishing forest sprung up around it. This fragment was found by the locals from nearby [[Innazpa]] and, though less powerful than the *Starstone*, it still granted mythic power to these explorers, transforming them into hero-gods, known in the local language as yans and yantis, who went on to free the land from the [[Razatlan|Razatlani Empire]] and found the nation of Xopatl.
