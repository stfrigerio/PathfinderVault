> The **Icerime Peaks** are a mountain range that mark the nation of [[Brevoy|Brevoys]] eastern border with [[Iobaria]]. They run roughly from the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]] in the north, all the way down to the [[Rostland Plains]] in the south. The Peaks are quite picturesque, capped with white snow and ice that melts every spring to produce giant waterfalls, and refills beautiful, clear mountain lakes. Few travel through the mountains to Iobaria, however, as that wasted country can offer little in terms of trade. Scattered throughout the Icerime Peaks are entrances to mountain dungeons from the time of the ancient empire of Iobaria; some dungeons are dated even older and are haunted by ghosts and spirits of long-perished soldiers and miners who once occupied the lands.
