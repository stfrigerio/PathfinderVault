> While the **Sudisan Peaks** are smaller and less volcanic than the [[Chenlun Mountains]], they are actually the more deadly of [[Valashmai Jungle|Valashmais]] two mountain ranges. Plants grow with an incredible fecundity across the Sudisan Peaks and most are unusually dangerous, being either [[Poison|poisonous]] or having acidic sap. The Sudisan Peaks are also home to a wide variety of murderous [[Plant|plant creatures]] including [[Assassin vine|assassin]] and viper vines, [[Flytrap|giant flytraps]], and [[Fungus|fungus]]-encrusted groves of [[Tendriculos|tendriculoses]].
