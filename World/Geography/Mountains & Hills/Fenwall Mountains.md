> The **Fenwall Mountains** separate the [[Mushfens]] from the fertile lands surrounding [[Korvosa]]. The Fenwall Mountains are thought to be monster infested, but the rich veins of metal that run beneath them still draw many prospectors. These prospectors vary from loners and outcasts trying to strike it rich to far larger operations sponsored by major trading houses, especially Korvosa-based operations. While these mountains are dotted with these prospecting operations, they are far from tame and the civilizing effect of these mines is negligible. The ore that is mined there is loaded onto [[Barge|barges]] in the town of [[Baslwief]] and shipped via the [[Sarwin River]] to towns such as [[Palin's Cove|Palins Cove]] where it can be processed further.
> Millennia ago, the Fenwall Mountains were also the location of a subterranean [[Summoning|summoning]] vault used by a cult of [[Thaumaturgist|thaumaturgists]] known as the [[Thrallkeepers]].
