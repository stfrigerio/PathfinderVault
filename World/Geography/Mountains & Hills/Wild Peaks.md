> The **Wild Peaks** is the name given to the individual mountains of the [[Zi Ha Mountains|Zi Ha range]] that are controlled by neither the [[Samsaran|samsarans]] nor the bloodthirsty [[Giant|giants]] and [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]] that dominate so many other peaks. Instead, the Wild Peaks are home either to less-intelligent monsters or just to natural wildlife. While Wild Peaks can be found across the length and breadth of [[Zi Ha]], they are most common in the lowlands regions that border the neighbouring kingdoms of [[Jinin]] and [[Wanshou]].
