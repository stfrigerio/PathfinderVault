> The **Pardaparbat Mountains** stretch across the north-western reaches of [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]], separating the lush interior from the [[Obari Ocean]]. The majority of the Pardaparbat Mountains lie in the region of the [[Western Ghats]] but the range also extends into the [[Narhari Desert]]. Around the valley of [[Viritash's Tail|Viritashs Tail]], a large number of [[Linnorm|linnorms]] and other corrupted [[Dragon|dragons]] battle each other for control of the valley and the unholy [[Artifact|artifact]] that lies at its heart. In the very south of the range, sits the towns of [[Adhaarm]] and [[Vinpinna]], each controlled by a different set of [[Undead|undead]] martial artists. Within the highest reaches of the mountain, settlements and temples of the [[Vudrani-Parbatkay]] ethnicity can be found.
