> The **Arthfell Mountains** (sometimes known as the **Arthfell Peaks**) are a minor mountain range located in southern [[Andoran]], southeast of the [[Arthfell Forest]] and south of the [[Nogortha Peaks]]. Barely 40 miles in length, the Arthfell Mountains are largely covered in purple heather and small stands of fir trees, and possess a rugged beauty seldom seen in more settled lands.
