> The **Urglin Gap**, named for the city of [[Urglin]] on its western edge, is the wide arid plain that connects western [[Hold of Belkzen|Belkzen]] to the [[Storval Plateau]] in [[Varisia]]. Many battles have taken place upon that vast scrubland between the [[Kodar Mountains]] to the north and the [[Mindspin Mountains]] to the south. Urglin Gap is the main way to traverse the mountains between Belkzen and Varisia.
