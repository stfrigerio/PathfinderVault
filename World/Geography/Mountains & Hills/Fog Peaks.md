> The **Fog Peaks** are a large mountain range in eastern [[Avistan]] that form the border between the nations of [[Taldor]] (to the south) and [[Galt]] (to the north). They run from Taldor's northern [[Verduran Forest]] in a generally northeasterly direction, eventually running into foothills just south of Galt's eastern [[Boarwood]]. Their name comes from their perpetually fog- and cloud-shrouded mountain tops, which constantly dump precipitation. Winter comes early in the Fog Peaks, with snow blanketing the higher elevations in early Fall.


## Inhabitants

> The Fog Peaks are known to be a wild, uncivilized land. [[Frost giant|Frost giants]] are common, while [[Roc|rocs]] soar over the northern half of the range near the Boarwood. The largest clan of frost giants is the Fogstompers and claims a huge swath of the peaks north of the headwaters of the [[Verduran Fork]] river. One of the most well-known frost giants is [[Bjarlsfarn|Bjarlsfarn the Bloody]], who wields a powerful magical weapon made from one of Galt's infamous [[Nethys/Artifacts/Final Blade|Final Blades]]. Less numerous, but nevertheless still dangerous, are the populations of [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]], [[Ettin|ettins]], [[Frost worm|frost worms]], [[Thunderbird|thunderbirds]], [[Remorhaz|remorhazes]], and supposedly even [[White dragon|white dragons]] said to make their home there as well. Two aggressive white dragons, Icemourne and Mirrorwing lair north of the Verduran Forest and are a danger for the travelers from [[Wispil]] to [[Woodsedge]]. An ancient [[Cyclops|cyclops]] [[Necromancer|necromancer]], by the name of [[Terokar]], dwells deep beneath the towering Fog Peaks in eastern Galt.
> Small [[Taldor|Taldan]] settlements exist at the nation's northern border and often suffer depredations from the giants in the mountains, especially during the winter months. Members of the [[Ulfen Guard]], known for their survival and giant-hunting skills, sometimes take a leave from their usual duties to hunt down frost giants and other threats from the Fog Peaks.
