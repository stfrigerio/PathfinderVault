> **Frostmire** is the name given to the northwestern-most region of the [[Worldwound]], now known as the [[Sarkoris Scar]]. It borders the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] to the west, and is a largely desolate land filled with with stinking fens and ragged hills.



## History

> Composed mostly of inhospitable marshes and ragged hills, Frostmire was sparsely populated even before the [[Demon|demons]] arrived. When the Worldwound opened in [[4606 AR]], the colorful northern lights that had graced these latitudes for aeons temporarily transformed into the shape of a crying woman. Priests of the [[Empyreal Lord]] [[Pulura]] received additional visions of impending doom, giving the local [[Kellid]] tribes several weeks of advanced warning to escape the coming invasion. When the demons finally arrived after having brought down eastern and southern [[Sarkoris]], they found nothing but empty villages and desolate wasteland.


## Geography

> Frostmire can be broken down into two geographical regions: the ragged hills known as the  [[Wolfcrags]], and the frigid marshlands called [[Frostmire Fen]]. The Wolfcrags occupy Frostmire's north and rise to the west into the [[Tusk Mountains]]. They get their name from their most notorious inhabitants: the large packs of [[Dire wolf|dire wolves]] that inhabit its countless, confusing valleys. The Frostmire Fen are huge, frigid marshlands punctuated by sulfurous hot springs. The [[Forest of Stones]] and [[Northmounds]] funnel the frigid, arctic air from the [[Crown of the World]] down into Frostmire, making it the coldest region of the Worldwound.


### Notable Settlements

> The only city of any size that existed in this part of [[Sarkoris]] was [[Dyinglight]], as Frostmire was never a heavily populated region. No [[Human|humans]] lived in Dyinglight during the century of demonic occupation, as it was populated mostly by [[Fiendish marsh giant|fiendish marsh giants]] led by the [[Glungur|Glungur the Mighty]], high priest of [[Kostchtchie]]. These giants remain there even after the closing of the Worldwound, and are believed to have taken up [[Cannibalism|cannibalism]].

## Inhabitants

> Of little interest to the primary power centers of the Worldwound (including the followers of [[Deskari]] who prefer challenging the [[Mendevian Crusaders]] to the east and south), Frostmire was a haven for those loyal to lesser demonic powers. [[Hezrou|Hezrous]] loyal to the foul [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Gogunta]] populated the Frostmire, eagerly searching for sunken Sarkorian relics, while [[Shadow demon|shadow demons]] loyal to [[Shax]] infiltrated and possessed a band of Kellid [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]] in [[Sabertooth Vale]]. Frostmire was also home to [[Fungus queen|fungus queens]] who lived near the warm, sulfurous springs, eager to expand their depraved cults in honor of [[Cyth-V'sug|Cyth-Vsug]] and her high priestess [[Enivuni]]. As has already been mentioned above, the former city of Dyinglight is populated by fiendish marsh giants loyal to Kostchtchie. Outside of Sabertooth Vale, humanoids are virtually absent from Frostmire.


### Creatures and other hazards

> Despite having been on the periphery of Worldwound demonic politics, Frostmire remains a dangerous region. Bowel worms infest the tainted waters of Frostmire Fen, midnight morels thrive in caverns and other dark places, the fungus known as Shax's beard breeds in its most desolate regions, [[Urannag|urannags]] seek to trap the unwary, [[Derakni|locus demons]] infest the skies, and [[Demonic vermin|demonic vermin]] scuttle in the shadows, avoiding the more powerful denizens.
