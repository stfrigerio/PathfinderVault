> The **Napsune Mountains** are a major mountain range in north-western [[Garund]].  They begin in north-western [[Rahadoum]], between the waters of the [[Jodin River|Jodin]] and Winding Way River, and travel southeast for hundreds of miles before joining the larger [[Barrier Wall]] mountains on the southern border of Rahadoum.
> The mountains continue southwards for some distance beyond the Barrier Wall, forming part of the eastern border between the [[Sodden Lands]] and the [[Mwangi Expanse]].
> [[Shepherd's Rock|Shepherds Rock]], the unconquerable fortress and home of the [[Pure Legion]], sits high in the mountains.
