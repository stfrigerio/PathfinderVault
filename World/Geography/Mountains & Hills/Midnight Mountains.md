> The Vault known as the **Midnight Mountains** is one of the largest in [[Orv]]—the lowest level of the [[Darklands]]—and acts as a crossroads for much of Orvian traffic due to its central location. It has the [[Crystal Womb]] and [[Land of Black Blood]] to the north, [[Ilvarandin]] to the west, and the [[Black Desert]] to the south.
> The Midnight Mountains are at the bottom of the [[Endless Gulf]], which stretches up all the way to [[Nar-Voth]]. Moisture seeps down from [[Lake Nirthran]] above in [[Sekamina]], and can fall to the Vault floor as rain. This water makes its way into [[Ilvarandin]] as what becomes known as the [[Irikusk River]] and then flows into the [[Sightless Sea]].
> The mountains which give the Vault its name are two miles high on average, but the ceiling is a further two miles above the tallest peak.
> The Vault is lit by six glowing "moons", that are actually particularly large [[Mu spore|mu spores]]. The [[Intellect devourer|intellect devourers]] of Ilvarandin use the spores given off by these creatures as one of the ingredients for the [[Drug|drug]] known as [[Midnight milk|midnight milk]].


## Denizens

> The Vault's central location makes it one of Orv's most well-travelled regions. However, travellers must contend with the dangers posed by denizens of the Midnight Mountains—[[Gug|gugs]], [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]], [[Mongrelman|mongrelmen]], [[Morlock|morlocks]], [[Drider|driders]], [[Seugathi|seugathis]], [[Pech|pech]], [[Roper|ropers]], and [[Umbral dragon|umbral dragons]].
