> **Whisperfall Pass** is the largest and most well-known pass through the southern [[Tusk Mountains]], connecting the [[Hold of Belkzen]] to the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Canterwall]]. Because of the Belkzen [[Orc|orcs]]' love of raiding [[Human|human]] lands, it is also one of the most contested areas in the country, with the [[Skull Eater tribe]] controlling its eastern slopes while the [[Blood Trail tribe]] dominates in the west.
