> The **Iceworm Hills** lie in the north-western corner of [[Icemark]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] just south of the high [[Stormspear Mountains]] range. The Iceworm Hills are renowned for the large number of [[Remorhaz|remorhaz]] and [[Frost worm|frost worms]] that dwell there, menacing any who enter their territory. The Iceworm Hills are so dangerous that the [[Varki]] people only visit the hills once per generation when young Varki hunt the ice worms (a catch-all term that covers both frost worms and remorhaz) as part of a dangerous coming of age ritual. These groups prefer hunting the remorhaz due to the lethal explosion that occurs when a frost worm is killed, also the remorhaz spines and teeth are used in Varki [[Scrimshaw|scrimshaw]].
