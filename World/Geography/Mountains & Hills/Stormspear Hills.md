> The **Stormspear Hills** lie on the northern edge of the [[Thanelands]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], dividing it from the eternal ice of the [[Crown of the World]]. The Hills act as a gap in the [[Stormspear Mountains]] which rise up to the west and east of them. The [[Path of Aganhei]] runs through the Stormspear Hills connecting [[Avistan]] with the [[Crown of the World]].
