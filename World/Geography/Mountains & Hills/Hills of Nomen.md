> The Hills of Nomen is a mountain range stretching from the (even more imposing) [[Icerime Peaks]] south to the [[Castrovin Sea]]. It creates a natural border between [[Iobaria]] and the nations of [[Brevoy]] and [[Galt]].
> Named by a fearful [[Taldan]] traveler, the Hills of Nomen are dangerous to wanderers who fail to heed the local inhabitants, for the hills are home to numerous [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaur]] tribes who defend their territory fiercely. Other non-human races dwell here too, making travel across the rugged terrain dangerous at best, even along the ancient [[Koloran road|Koloran roads]]. A number of [[Human|human]] armies have attempted to "stem the inhuman tides" only to be destroyed, their bones littering the hillsides.
