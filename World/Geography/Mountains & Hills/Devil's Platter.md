> **Devil's Platter** is a limestone escarpment less than one mile southeast of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of [[Sandpoint]], and is the largest rocky rise in the area. Many clefts, cracks, and caverns can be found in its desolated expanse, though the most infamous of these is called the [[Pit Sandpoint hinterlands|Pit]]. A small tribe of [[Goblin|goblins]], the [[Birdcruncher goblins|Birdcrunchers]], dwells in caverns along its western side. It is rumored that [[Devil|devil]]-worshiping [[Bugbear|bugbears]] live deeper in the Devil's Platter. [[Ghoul]]-infested warrens run below the area, connecting the old smuggler's tunnels beneath Sandpoint to [[Paupers' Graves|Paupers Graves]].
> A large hole known as the Pit extends downward from the center of the Devil's Platter, connecting to numerous caverns running within the Platter itself and the broader Sandpoint Hinterlands. The caverns beneath the Devil's Platter are home to numerous creatures, including goblin tribes, [[Gremlin|gremlins]], [[Derro|derro]], [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]], and [[Dark folk|dark folk]]. In the deepest part of the pit is the lair of the [[Sandpoint Devil]].
