> The **Shining Mountains** are in eastern [[Osirion]], between the [[Underdunes]] and the [[Salt Hills]]. These towering peaks rise unexpectedly from the [[Scorpion Coast]]'s rolling sands and are home to a variety of mystical creatures. The best-known inhabitant is [[Paishnia]], a proud female [[Griffon|griffon]]. A handful of [[Androsphinx|androsphinxes]] are also said to inhabit the lower reaches of the mountains. What the androsphinxes desire to learn is a mystery scholars have not yet been able to solve.
