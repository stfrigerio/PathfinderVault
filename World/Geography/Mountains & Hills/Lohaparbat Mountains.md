> The **Lohaparbat Mountains** stretch across the south-eastern regions of [[Vudra]] extending down from the [[Falling Mountains]] region into the [[Open Bridge]] area. The Lohaparbat Mountains' rain shadow makes the central steppes of the Falling Mountains region perfect for [[Tea|tea]] growing. In the western reaches of the Lohaparbat Mountains, the peaks reach incredible heights and they are frequently ravaged by extremely powerful storms. At the eastern end of the range, the Lohaparbat Mountains crack open with vast rents in the earth causing frequent rock slides and regular lava flows. This activity is blamed on the mechanical [[Deity|god]] [[Dhuangir]], who is said to lie buried beneath the mountains. His [[Duergar|duergar]] followers endlessly excavate the mountains trying to free him and these excavations have created the vast magma pool known as [[Sholay]]. The Lohaparbat Mountains are home to the highest population of [[Garuda|garuda]] in all Vudra. One of the most famous garuda residents of the mountains is the [[Monk|monk]] [[Mahadev]] who began meditating near the peak of [[Gyanpad]] over a decade ago. He has not moved from the spot since his meditation began and a small cult has formed around him.
