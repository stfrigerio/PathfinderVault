> The **Barrier Wall** is the most extensive mountain range of northern [[Garund]]. They run in a general east-westerly direction, north of the jungles of the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. They stretch from southern [[Rahadoum]] in the west, through southern [[Thuvia]] and [[Osirion]] before turning south to form the western border of [[Katapesh]]. They end in the northernmost corner of magical [[Nex]].
> North of the Barrier Wall the land is arid and dry, exemplified by the deserts of Rahadoum, Thuvia, and Osirion. South of the mountains the air is filled with moisture and rain is common, with the rainforests and jungles of the Mwangi Expanse the dominant geographical feature.


## Inhabitants

> The mountains are home to a group of [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] known as the Stonewardens, who actively protect their home from mineral exploitation. [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll]] tribes are common in the eastern portions near Katapesh and Osirion, with occasional [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dragon|dragon]] sightings. The Barrier Wall's southernmost reaches are home to the monstrous, unnatural creations of the [[Nex|Nexian]] city of [[Ecanus]]' fleshforges.
> The [[Ravener|ravener]] [[Arantaros]] also makes its home here.
