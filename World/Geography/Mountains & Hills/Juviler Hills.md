> The **Juviler Hills** mark the northern edge of the small [[Lambreth|River Kingdom of Lambreth]]. Descending from the hills, numerous moss-banked streams and tumbling waterfalls feed the two rivers that frame Lambreth, the [[West Sellen River]] and its swift-running tributary: the Tolemaida River.
