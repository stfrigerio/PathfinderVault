> The **Skala Foothills**, in the southern part of the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of [[Wintercrux]] lie in the shadow of the [[Kodar Mountains]] and are rich in resources. More than two dozen mining camps provide Irrisen with tin, copper, iron and gold. Moreover rock quarries produce limestone and granite. According to some mining experts, gems may well be found in the future. A large network of shipping trails cross the Skala Foothills connecting the mining camps to [[Hope Lost]] and the town of [[Zlatomesto]].
> Many [[Sasquatch|sasquatch]] families inhabit the wooded areas of the Skala Foothills. Also brutish [[Giant|giants]], known as [[Ved|ved]], launch small raids against the mining camps and quarries.
