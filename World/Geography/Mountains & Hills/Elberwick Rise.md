> The **Elberwick Rise** is a basalt shelf which rises out of the southern edge of the [[Darkmoon Vale]]. It becomes a plateau which stretches to the south, eventually covering  most of [[Andoran]]. Much of the [[Arthfell Forest]] lies on top of the plateau.  Before the cataclysm of [[Rending|The Rending]] the Rise rose much farther north, reaching all the way to the [[Five Kings Mountains]] but much of the northern area is now broken and irregular. Currently the Shire of Elberwick covers much of the Rise. The tower of [[Adamas]] rises out of the cliff shelf proper and a few miles away the town of [[Olfden]] sits on top of a short cliff section.
