> **Rimeskull** is a mountain on the western edge of the [[Kodar Mountains]] in northwestern [[Varisia]]. Located on the banks of [[Lake Stormunder]], it is named for the vaguely skull-shaped carving visible from miles away, the mouth of which is a large cave entrance. 
> The carving is a relic of ancient [[Thassilon]], and the person depicted in the massive carving is the founder of Thassilon itself: [[Xin|Emperor Xin]]. During the time of this ancient empire, [[Runelords|runelords]] commonly carved their faces into the mountainsides that faced their capital cities. The carving of Xin, however, faces the [[Runeforge]], a place of great importance shared by all of the runelords.
> At the mountain's western base, just off the lake, lies a ring of seven ten-foot-tall, open-mouthed stone heads angled toward each other known as the Sihedron Circle.  This Thassilonian ruin was recently discovered to be a [[Magic|magical]] entrance to the Runeforge.
> The territorial [[White dragon|white dragon]] [[Arkrhyst]] makes his home on Rimeskull and endangers any expedition there.
