> The **Enlightened Peaks** is the name given to the mountains of the [[Zi Ha Mountains|Zi Ha range]] that are controlled by the [[Samsaran|samsaran]]. On the whole, the Zi Ha Mountains are wild and untamed, many controlled by bands of savage [[Giant|giants]], outcast [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]] from [[Kaoling]], or even groups of murderous [[Cannibalism|cannibals]]; while other peaks belong to less intelligent monsters and wildlife. The Enlightened Peaks however are bastions of civilisation and spirituality, dotted with monasteries, awe-inspiring vistas and contemplative cities such as [[Babschu-Jong]], [[Byangshar-Jong]], [[Dogul-Jong]], and the capital of [[Zi Ha]], the wondrous [[Sangpo-Jong]].
