> **Dirrinir**, the **Deathly Mountain**, is a towering peak of barren rock in [[Iobaria|Iobarias]] [[Icerime Peaks]]. The mountain itself is carved with craggy steps that predate even the [[Cyclops|cyclopes]] of the [[Koloran Empire]], which lead up to the over 20 entrances to the mountain's labyrinth-like caverns. While some legends argue that the first [[Giant|giants]] or [[Cyclops|cyclopes]] were spawned within the mountain, it is known that numerous powerful [[World/Items & Equipment/Artifacts/Artifact|artifacts]] have been recovered from its depths, including the Diadem of Thyrv, the Crown of Mirim, the Perobov Maul, and Kridor's Shininglaive.
