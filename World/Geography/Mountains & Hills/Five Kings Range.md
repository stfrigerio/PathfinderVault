## Inhabitants

> The Five Kings Mountains is a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] territory. The mountains are mostly rocky with occasional plateaus, and are home to savage [[Giant|giants]] and bloodthirsty wildlife. Outsiders see very few natural resources worth the danger to exploit. The border nations don't establish settlements any closer than the foothills or approaching the dwarven territory, nor do they interfere with the industry carried out by the dwarves in the higher reaches, although they usually conduct a profitable trade with them. At the forested foothills, dwarven lumber mills work to procure timber and firewood to support tunneling operations and provide light and heat below the surface.
