> The **Stony Mountains** of northwestern [[Varisia]] are an extension of the greater [[Kodar Mountains]].  Beginning as foothills just northeast of the city of [[Riddleport]], they straddle the [[Storval Rise]], running alongside the [[Lurkwood]] for a total length of about 120 miles.  They are one of the few non-[[Giant|giant]] infested mountains of Varisia, thanks to the constant patrolling of the [[ShoantiTribes of the Shoanti|Shoanti Tamiir-Quah]] or Wind Clan, who call all land within sight of its peaks their home.  This does not mean that the Stony Mountains are without danger, as creatures such as [[Manticore|manticores]], [[Griffon|griffons]], and tribes of [[Harpy|harpies]] are plentiful.
