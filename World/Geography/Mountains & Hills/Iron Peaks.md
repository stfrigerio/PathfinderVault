> The **Iron Peaks** are an isolated range of mountain peaks in central [[Varisia]] beginning near the northern [[Sanos Forest]], stretching over the [[Storval Rise]] onto the [[Storval Plateau]], and forming the western border of the [[Storval Deep]] before trailing off into foothills east of [[Lake Skotha]].  The mountains are criss-crossed by two major rivers: the [[Muschkal River|Muschkal]], which eventually empties into the Storval Deep; and an unnamed river which flows into [[Lake Coal]], [[Claybottom Lake]] and from there into the [[Skull River]]. In Varisia's lowlands, the Iron Peaks provide the area with a significant rain shadow, making the rolling land around the [[Lampblack River]] quite fertile.  The mountains themselves are wilderness, seldom traveled by [[Humanoid|humanoids]], and are primarily inhabited by [[Hill giant|hill giants]], [[Stone giant|stone giants]], and [[Ogre|ogres]].
