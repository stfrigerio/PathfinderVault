> The **Johar Mountains** stretch for over a thousand miles from the northernmost reaches of [[Vudra]] right into its central heartlands. They serves as the divide between the [[Crying Jungle]] and [[Western Ghats]] in the north, while further south they divide the [[Narhari Desert]] from the regions of the [[Golden Basin]] and [[Wide Water]]. The headwaters of the [[Baghshahi River|Baghshahi]], [[Matra River|Matra]] and [[Kalyan River|Kalyan]] rivers all begin in the Johar Mountains. In the south of the range sits the mountain [[Adarparbat]], a place believed to be holy to the [[Deity|goddess]] [[Sarenrae]]. The Johar Mountains were originally settled by [[Ysoki|ratfolk]] and their tunnels still run under many parts of the Western Ghats. Within the highest reaches of the mountain, settlements and temples of the [[Vudrani-Parbatkay]] ethnicity can be found.
