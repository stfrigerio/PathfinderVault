> **Antler Rock** is a small, barren and wild island within the [[Ironbound Archipelago]] and the most easterly island comprising the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of the [[Ironbound Islands]]. Antler Rock consists almost entirely of jagged tors lancing into the sky out of the ocean's depth with almost no areas of flat land. The island is riddled with caves which are believed to connect all the way down to the [[Darklands]]. Certainly, the caves are inhabited by traditional Darkland denizens including [[Dark folk|dark folk]], [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]], and even enclaves of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Duergar|duergar]]. Above this, amongst the stunted grey-green pines that cling to the peaks, the windy heights of Antler Rock are no less dangerous. Inhabited by fearsome aerial beasts, including [[Pegasus|pegasi]], [[Griffon|griffons]] and draconic [[Wyvern|wyverns]], this violent menagerie only adds to the island's reputation for danger. This fearsome reputation draws a steady stream of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] and young [[Ulfen]] [[Warrior|warriors]] to the island to test their mettle and prove their strength.
