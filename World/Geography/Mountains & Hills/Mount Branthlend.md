> The tallest mountain in the [[Stolen Lands]], **Mount Branthlend** rises from the landscape like a distinctively shaped [[Monk|monks]] head. An incredible 5,400 feet tall, the mountain, also known as the **Peak of Broken Promises**, features a bare, knob-like pinnacle of white stone. The mountain grants its name to the range in which it is found: the Branthlend Mountains.
> The mythos of the mountain is dominated by tales of Noarra, the great love of the [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarian]] lord Targran, who shouted curses from the peak of the mountain after the barbarian warlord took another woman as his queen. In that moment a great storm of fire and stone encompassed the peak of the mountain, and Noarra was said to be transformed into a great [[Black dragon|black dragon]], who then rampaged across eastern [[Numeria]]. This myth attracts many travellers from throughout the land, drawn to the peak to cry out their own curses and oaths of vengeance.
