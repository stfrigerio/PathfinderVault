> The **Cliffs of Fury** are high, rocky cliffs on the southern coast of [[Cheliax]] on the [[Inner Sea]]. They are bordered inland by the [[Halikarnassos Hills]], to the east by the [[Bay of Solva]] and to the southwest by the [[Jewelcoast Cape]]. The area contains no major settlements, but its small fishing villages produce a disproportionately high number of skilled climbers.
