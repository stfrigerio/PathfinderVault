> The granite mountains of **Paego Peaks** on the [[Motaku Isle]] in the [[Shackles]] have no less than three active [[Volcano|volcanoes]] and bisect the isle into a northern and a southern region. They are home to many clans of [[Cave giant|cave giants]], [[Hill giant|hill giants]], and [[Stone giant|stone giants]], as well as [[Troll|trolls]]. The region features rich veins of [[Gold|gold]], [[Platinum|platinum]], and [[Iron|iron]]. The cave complexes of the granite mountains wind deep beneath the island's surface.
