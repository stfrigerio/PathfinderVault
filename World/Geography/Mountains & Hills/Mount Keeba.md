> **Mount Keeba** is the largest active [[Volcano|volcano]] in the [[Shackles]] and is known in the archipelago as "the Smoker". It is located on the volcanic isle of the [[Smoker]]. Slow but steady rivers of lava course down the mountain's northern slope, and steam hisses violently as the molten material strikes the ocean waters. A steady plume of smoke rises from the huge crater at the volcano's summit. The volcano lends its name to a trio of seers called [[Keeba's Eyes|Keebas Eyes]], access to whom can be difficult and long in waiting.
