> The **Rimethirst Mountains** are a chain of peaks that mark the northern boundaries of [[Avistan]] and one of the southern borders of the [[Crown of the World]]. The [[Path of Aganhei]] is one of the few known routes through the mountains. In the west, the Rimethirst Mountains are bordered by the [[Gulf of Svallmundr]], while in the east they connect with the Stained Peaks on the shores of [[Cholpod Gulf]]. The Giant-Downs of [[Urjuk]] lie in the Rimethirst range's shadow to the north.
> The former [[Mendev|Mendevian]] penal colony of Mantarin is located in the Rimethirst Mountains' eastern reaches.
