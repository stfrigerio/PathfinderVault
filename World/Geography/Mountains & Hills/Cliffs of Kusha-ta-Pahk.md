> The **Cliffs of Kusha-ta-Pahk** are on the north coast of [[Osirion]], west of the [[Alamein Peninsula]].
> The 250-foot-tall cliffs are carved to depict several of the [[God Kings]] of ancient Osirion. The huge monument was made in order to encourage the sailors of the vast Osirian fleets that plied the [[Inner Sea]]. [[Kusha-ta-Pahk]] was the name of the monument's main architect. The folds of their raiment form natural ledges, niches and caverns, reachable only by a dangerous climb from the harsh coast below. A number of monstrous inhabitants live in the cliffside caverns, including [[Harpy|harpies]] and [[Siren|sirens]].
