> **Tumbaja Mountain** is a pyramid located in northwestern [[Xopatl]], on the northern edge of [[Jolizpan Forest]], near the [[Mildanesi Mountains]], 30 miles northeast of [[Jolizpan]]. Made from shards of the *[[Starstone]]* with veins of empowered [[Djezet 1|djezet]] and [[Gold|gold]], it was constructed early in the [[Age of Darkness]] by the hero-gods who founded Xopatl with the power they gained from the *Starstone*, as a place where they could share their knowledge and hone their abilities.
> Several decades after the last hero-god [[Ascension|ascended]] and left Tumbaja Mountain, it was discovered by Xopatli explorers, who found that the pyramid still held great power, which infused the [[Plant|plants]] growing within the cracks of the stone. Over the next several years, they cultivated plants for the purpose of tapping into these energies—the prototype of the Veins of Creation. The most powerful of them, the kumaru tree, was grown in Tumbaja Mountain's high central chamber, nourished by [[Magic|magic]].
