> **Mount Shibotai** is a [[Volcano|volcano]] in the [[Minata|Minatan]] region of [[Tian Xia]]. It erupted in -24 [[Imperial Calendar|IC]] ([[-2524 AR]]) covering the continent in ash, darkening the skies for months, and forming a ring of islands at the northern end of the Minatan archipelago. Inhabitants feared it might herald a repeat of the catastrophes that caused the [[Age of Ashes]] almost 3,000 years before, though these fears eventually proved unfounded.
