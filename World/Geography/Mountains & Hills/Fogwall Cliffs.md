> The **Fogwall Cliffs** mark the eastern border of the city of [[Magnimar]]. This boundary is purely geographical, as the crashing waves of the [[Varisian Gulf]] lie beneath them. Atop the cliffs lies one of the wealthiest districts of Magnimar: the [[Alabaster District]]; whose northern border is also provided by the cliffs. The cliffs themselves are about 100 feet tall; they are nearly vertical but are a stable escarpment.
