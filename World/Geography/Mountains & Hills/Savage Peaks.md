> The **Savage Peaks** is the name given to the mountains of the [[Zi Ha Mountains|Zi Ha range]] that are not controlled by the [[Samsaran|samsaran]] of [[Zi Ha]] but instead are controlled by other, more bloodthirsty inhabitants. Those who call the Savage Peaks home range from tribes of brutish [[Giant|giants]], to flesh-hungry [[Cannibalism|cannibals]], to outcast [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]] from the neighbouring kingdom of [[Kaoling]]. Kaoling even has a small outpost within the Savage Peaks known as [[Fort Kragang]]. The Savage Peaks tend to be located in either the northernmost reaches of the Zi Ha Mountains or in their eastern or western foothills near neighbouring Kaoling or [[Chu Ye]].
