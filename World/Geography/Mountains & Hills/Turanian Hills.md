> The **Turanian Hills** around the city of [[Westcrown]] in southern [[Cheliax]] provide rich lands for the cultivation of olives, grapes, and orchard trees. Clay deposits, known as "blood-clay" for its distinctive color, found in the hills along the river are the source of the vibrant red pottery peculiar to the region.
