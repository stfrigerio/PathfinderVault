> The **Chalk Cliffs** consists of a limestone box canyon that has been carved by centuries of wind and water erosion. There is little natural life to be found in the Chalk Cliffs, only small hardy scrubs. The ash pale's main inhabitants are chalky [[Gargoyle|gargoyles]] that hunt through out the rest of the [[Brazen Peaks]] and [[Uwaga Highlands]]. These gargoyles live in the various caves and openings that dot the cliffs. These caves are only accessible by worn, ancient trails that are supposedly [[Dwarf|dwarven]] in origin. Some believe that these trails were used by the dwarves of [[Hammerfalls]], who supposedly used to quarry the stone here and might have had a hand in creating some of the caves that are now used as lairs.
