> More than 14,000 feet above sea level, the distinctively hooked peak of **Mount Emihym** dominates the [[Menador Mountains]] south of the [[North Plains]]. The mountain fortresses, once a central location for [[Cheliax]]'s border defense against [[Nidal]], have been abandoned since the Chelish victory in the [[Everwar]]. These citadels are now home [[Orcs|orcs]], trolls, giants, and yetis. But the [[Bellflower Network]] also makes extensive use of Mount Emihym's tunnels and caves. Some believe that the network has even built long-term refuges for escaped [[Slavery|slaves]] deep within the mountain itself.
