The region around [[Almhult]], where the Hellrung Mountains are located.
> 
The **Hellrung Mountains** are a [[Volcanic|volcanically]] active range of jagged granite and basalt mountains and hills in the [[Crown of the World]] near [[Avistan]], around [[Almhult]] and along the [[Gulf of Svallmundr]], [[Whitefang Bay]], and [[Steaming Sea]]. It is wracked by frequent earthquakes and sooty eruptions, separated by ancient lava flows, ash deposits, ravines, and badlands. The source of the Maganis River carries water, volcanic ash, and eruption debris from the range into the Gulf of Svallmunder.


## Seismic activity

> The mountain range's seismic activity extends into the Steaming Sea, where new volcanoes generate new islands — sometimes suddenly and explosively — and contributes to its churning currents, undersea ridges, geothermal vents, and [[Tsunami|tsunamis]]. Its earthquakes send tidal surges of salt water into the [[Hazalin Marshes]].


## Inhabitants

> A few [[Dwarf|dwarven]] trading posts in the mountains focus their trade underground. Few people attempt to mine or exploit the Hellrung Mountains due to its many natural hazards, though some [[Gold|gold]] prospectors from Almhult are desperate enough to try.
