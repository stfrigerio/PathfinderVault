> The **Menador Gap** is the sole passage through the [[Menador Mountains]] and [[Ravounel Forest]], connecting the northwestern corner of the [[Archduchy of Menador]] to southeastern [[Ravounel]] in [[Cheliax]]. Part of the gap is a treacherous stretch of narrow mountainside roads constructed long ago by [[Dwarf|dwarven]] engineers, with [[Menador Keep]] located at the roads' narrowest point.
