> The **Takalak Hills** on [[Motaku Isle]] in the [[Shackles]] are just below the southern and eastern slopes of the [[Paego Peaks]], the granite mountains that bisect the isle. They are the hunting grounds of [[Thylacine|thylacines]], predatory [[Lion|lions]] and [[Tiger|tigers]], [[Manticore|manticores]], and a few mated pairs of [[Behir|behirs]]. It is said that the central foothills is also home to a young [[Copper dragon|copper dragon]] by the name of [[Rokiere]].
