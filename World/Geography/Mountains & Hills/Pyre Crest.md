> **Pyre Crest** is a mountain in the area of [[Brazen Peaks]] that remains uninhabited by the [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] that otherwise litter the range. Not even scrubs grow on the scorched sides of Pyre Crest though the eruption that covered the sides of the mountain in lava occurred centuries ago. Blackened tracks of hardened magma cover the surface of the mountain like veins.
