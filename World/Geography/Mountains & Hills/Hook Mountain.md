> **Hook Mountain** is the southern-most peak of central [[Varisia|Varisias]] [[Iron Peaks]], located just south of the [[Storval Deep]] and north of the expansive [[Sanos Forest]]. It is synonymous with the Kreegs, the most bloodthirsty clan of [[Ogre|ogres]] on [[Golarion]], who until recently claimed the region around the mountain as their personal domain.
