> The [[Taldor|Taldan]] coastline between  [[Cassomir]] and the mouth of the [[River Porthmos]] is called **Jagged Saw**. This ragged coastline features rocky cliffs and shallow rock formations. The only natural harbor of the area is at [[Ridonport]], though a lot of small boat-safe coves can be found along its length. The winds of the [[Inner Sea]] in this region blow at 30 to 40 miles per hour. To support the ship traffic, Old [[Taldor]] built thousands of towering, [[Magic|magically]] powered lighthouses along the coast, but only a few remain intact. One of these lighthouses, located at Cassomir harbor, is called the [[Treacherous Jack]].
