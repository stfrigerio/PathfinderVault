> Located in the central [[Napsune Mountains]] of [[Rahadoum]], the mountain named **Ghataking** is most famous for the foul inhabitants that dwell upon it. Ghataking serves as the lair of a [[Zahhak|zahhak]] (a powerful type of [[Azi|azi]] dragon) named [[Khanjar-Khanayr]] but more commonly known as "Stone Maw". He lairs on this peak awaiting a divine prophecy delivered by foul [[Ahriman]] himself and is served by a cult of [[Usij]], evil [[Div|div]]-worshippers all but wiped out by the church of [[Sarenrae]].
