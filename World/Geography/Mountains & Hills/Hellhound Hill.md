> **Hellhound Hill** (sometimes spelt **Hell Hound Hill**) is a district in the capital city of [[Egorian]] in [[Cheliax]]. It is located at the south-eastern portion of the city.
> Hellhound Hill is home to many of the richest and most patriotic of Egorian's citizens, the wealthiest of whom live near Thrune Manor, rising above the rest of the district. The very term "Hellhound" has come to mean those who would do anything to win favor from the [[House Thrune|Thrune ruling family]].
> The city's Temple of Iomedae is also located here, though those who attend are fully aware that their actions are carefully monitored by informants.
