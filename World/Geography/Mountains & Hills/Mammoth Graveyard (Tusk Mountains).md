*For other meanings of "**Mammoth graveyard**", please see [[Mammoth graveyard disambiguation]].*
> The **Mammoth Graveyard** is a mountain valley in the eastern foothills of the [[Tusk Mountains]], where [[Mammoth|mammoths]] near the end of their lives travel to die. The valley has grown into an intelligent [[Genius loci|genius loci]], guiding mammoths to itself while confounding travellers, who only find it by accident and never twice. Since the formation of the [[Worldwound]], however, the Mammoth Graveyard has been corrupted, and mammoths no longer come there; it is now home to [[Bone golem|bone golems]] and a massive [[Flesh colossus|flesh colossus]] made from rotting mammoth corpses.
