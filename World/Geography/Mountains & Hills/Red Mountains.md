> The **Red Mountains** of northwestern [[Varisia]] are technically part of the [[Kodar Mountains|Kodar range]], but are different enough in character that they are given a separate name.  Located north of the [[Velashu River]] and west of the [[Lurkwood]], they are some of the shortest of Varisia's highlands.  The soil is often a dark red due to its rich iron deposits.  



## Inhabitants

> The mountains are mined by a few determined miners and used by a handful of herdsmen who often combine forces to fend off attacks by the violent barbarians of the [[Nolands]].  These attacks have become more frequent and organized of late, and the people of the Red Mountains are beginning to get worried. Past pleas for help have been answered as [[PathfinderWiki/Ranger|rangers]] and [[Paladin|paladins]] regularly patrol the northern Varisian border but the recent upsurge has led the inhabitants of the Red Mountains to send delegations south for aid, including to [[Riddleport]] and the [[Order of the Nail]] [[Hellknights]] based in [[Magnimar]].
