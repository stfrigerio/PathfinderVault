> The **Gnashers** are a small, isolated mountain range located on [[Varisia]]'s [[Storval Plateau]], rising to the north and west of [[Lake Skotha]].  They are home to numerous tribes of primitive [[Hill giant|hill giants]] who do not take kindly to trespassers.  The southern edges are also claimed by the [[Shriikirri-Quah]] or Hawk Clan [[Shoanti]], who have great respect for the many birds of prey who hunt there.
