 Ascending the Kodar peaks
> The Kodar Mountains, known to the [[Shoanti]] as the World's Roof, are among the highest mountain ranges in the [[Inner Sea region]].



## Geography

> The Kodar Mountains were formed from the [[Psychic magic|psychic]] convulsions of the [[Great Old One]] [[Mhar]], when it found itself trapped under the crust of [[Golarion]] and uttered a scream which pushed against the surface. Located in the north of [[Avistan]], they form the natural boundary between several nations. The extensive range forms the north and northwestern border of [[Varisia]] separating it from the [[Hold of Belkzen]] to the west and the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], [[Irrisen]] and the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] to the north.


## Inhabitants

> Few creatures call the Kodars their home, as only the toughest creatures can survive there. Known inhabitants include [[Roc|rocs]], [[Dragon|dragons]], [[Yeti|yeti]], [[Crag spider|crag spiders]], and [[Wendigo|wendigos]]. [[Storm giant|Storm]] and [[Stone giant|stone giants]] also inhabit the Kodar range. On the eastern edge of the mountains, [[Orc|orcs]] of the [[Dead Eye tribe]] live in crude villages near the [[Brimstone Haruspex]], while orcs of the [[Gutspear tribe]] live in caves.
