*For another meaning of "Golden Oasis", please see [[Golden Oasis Katapesh]].*
> The great **Golden Oasis** in [[Osirion]] is located in the middle of the northern [[Osirian Desert]]. It is a lotus-blossom-shaped series of lakes fed by submerged springs. The oasis provides enough water to supply the city of [[Shiman-Sekh]] which is situated just west of the oasis. It is also a natural habitat for many migratory birds and a number of farmers work its fertile land. The strangely regular shapes of its lakes cause many scholars to assume they have magical origins.
