> The **Everlight Oasis** (or **Ourzid-Mah** as the natives call it) is a holy site for followers of [[Sarenrae]].
> It is situated in [[Zelshabbar]], a [[Satrap|satrapy]] of the [[Empire of Kelesh]] in [[Casmaron]]. The oasis is said to have healing and rejuvenating qualities, and followers of the sun goddess come from far and wide to bathe in the water and to commune with fellow members of the faith from other lands. Unfortunately, with the pilgrims come those who wish to prey upon them, and some of them end up robbed or beaten, or worse.
