> Close to [[Vargas Swamp]], where the desert gives away to the swamp, underground water channels turn the ground to mud in a patch known as **Suketh'ma**. A large patch of sand conceals countless quicksand pits interspersed with muddy ditches, and travelers frequently disappear forever in the sucking pits. The mire is home to many [[Sand eel|sand eels]].
