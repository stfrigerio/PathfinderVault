 The [[Sunbleached Tower]] is a Meraz Desert landmark.
> The **Meraz Desert** is a sweltering wasteland of rolling sand dunes in southern [[Qadira]]. It is bordered to the north by the [[Zho Mountains]], and to the west and the south by the [[Obari Ocean]]. Only its westernmost section is considered to be part of [[Avistan]]; from there it extends eastward into [[Casmaron]] and beyond the knowledge of [[Inner Sea region|Inner Sea]] mapmakers.
> Although the desert is dry and inhospitable, it has been a place where religious cults have blossomed and thrived, much to the displeasure of the dervishes of [[Sarenrae]]. Most of these religions are swiftly put down, but some persist, hidden among the dunes. Occasionally, the scouring winds uncover ruins hidden beneath the sands.
> More recently, it appears the vast desert is expanding. The farming settlement of [[Dimayen]] is currently being slowly overwhelmed by encroaching dust storms, which have already claimed half of the buildings and farmsteads.
