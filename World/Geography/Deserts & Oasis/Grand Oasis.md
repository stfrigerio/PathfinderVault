> **Grand Oasis** is the north-easternmost of the sixteen city districts of [[Sothis]] in the 'lower' part of that city. It is one of the wealthy, peripheral suburbs of the city and sits between two similar districts: namely [[Marblecourt]] to the west and [[The Palms|the Palms]] to the south. Like the other rich, peripheral suburbs, Grand Oasis contains large oasis circles; wide, tree-lined streets; and excellent facilities for its inhabitants. These residents include wealthy merchants and craftsmen, civil servants and even nobles dwelling in their mansions.
