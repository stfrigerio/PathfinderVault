> The **Boreal Expanse** is the cold desert surrounding [[Golarion|Golarions]] North Pole, the frozen heart of the [[Crown of the World]]. The Expanse is the area within five degrees (about 350 miles) of the pole. This region is inhospitable to life, but supports some of the same species as the surrounding [[High Ice]]. Additionally, naturally occurring [[Portal|portals]] to the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]], especially the [[Plane of Air|Planes of Air]] and [[Plane of Water|Water]], make [[Mephit|mephits]] and [[Elemental|elementals]] common in this area.
> The ruins of the [[Nameless Spires]] stand at the center of the Boreal Expanse, leaking blackfrost into the surrounding ice.
