> The **Trackless Storm** is an endless stretch of sandstorm in southern [[Katapesh]] near the border with [[Nex]]. The trackless storm rages year-round regardless of the surrounding weather conditions, although the severity of the storm varies. Sometimes the Trackless Storm is little more than a mild dust cloud, while other times it blows strong enough to scour flesh from bone. The landscape within the storm constantly changes as the winds alter the sand dunes.
> Numerous rumours and legends are connected with the Trackless Storm. Some claim that a field of hardy, untouched [[Pesh|pesh]] lies at the heart of the storm, while others claim that the Stone Sorcerer's legendary [[Sanctum of Sand]] resides within a valley hidden inside its swirling winds.
