> The **Shaguang** desert is the largest arid region on the continent of [[Tian Xia]]. It sits in the eastern rain shadow of the [[Wall of Heaven]] mountains and is inhabited by tribes of nomadic [[Tian-La|Tian-Las]] known as the [[Mutabi-qi]].



## Geography

> Shaguang stretches across a huge area in the north-west of Tian Xia, its southern reaches are made of rocky badlands, sandy dunes, and salt flats, which slowly transform into frozen steppes and tundra the further north one goes towards the [[Crown of the World]]. While the lands of Shaguang are harsh, there is also a rugged beauty to them as well. There are small oases scattered across the length and breadth of the land and it is between these that the various tribes that live here migrate. To the west, the Wall of Heaven mountains separate the desert from the [[Ivory Sea]] and the [[Embaral Ocean]], while to the north of the mountain chain lies the frozen Crown of the World. The [[Tuunma River]] makes up the southern border of Shaguang, where it meets the northernmost reaches of neighbouring [[Lingshen]]. To the east, another river separates Shaguang from the more heavily inhabited steppes of the Kingdom of [[Hongal]]. Thunderstorms are a common occurrence during late summer in Shaguang.


## Inhabitants


### Mutabi-qi

> The tribes that inhabit Shaguang are known as the Mutabi-qi and, while technically they were considered part of the [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa Empire]], the desert was so remote they were all but unaffected by its fall a century ago. The Mutabi-qi know of survival methods and ways to live in even the harshest reaches of Shaguang and no one truly knows exactly how many tribes make up the Mutabi-qi. The tribes live in fear of what they call "Sky Spirits". The legends surrounding these spirits are numerous and sometimes contradictory and tales about them have spread far among the tribes, including that these Sky Spirits can walk on air, and live in a [[Flying city|flying city]]. This actually turns out to be true, in part.


### Yjae

> While the tribes below live in fear of them, the citizens of the flying city of [[Yjae]] are not cruel by any means, and do their best to limit contact with the tribes below. The last remains of the ancient [[Shory Empire]], the citizens of Yjae are reclusive as, despite having thousand of years, they have still not fully recovered from their flying city's attempt to cross the Wall of Heaven Mountains and the damage it did to their civilisation. The Mutabi-qi simply do not know what to make of their different customs and dark skin of the people of Yjae. Yjae has numerous monstrous inhabitants including many from the sinister [[Leng|Plane of Leng]].


### Kaiju

> Shaguang is also home to two colossal [[Kaiju|kaiju]]: beasts of enormous size and almost unimaginable power. The [[Rhinoceros|rhino]]-like [[Yorak]] has a hide of solid stone and wanders the most desolate reaches of Shaguang, his every step shaking the earth for miles around. He despises tall structures and destroys any he encounters; he is also known to hate other kaiju. [[Bezravnis]], a three-tailed, crimson [[Scorpion|scorpion]] kaiju, also dwells within Shaguang. Unlike Yorak, Bezravnis does not roam the land but instead sleeps for exactly two hundred and seventy three years until the return of the Inferno Star. Between rampages it hibernates somewhere in the shadow of the Wall of Heaven Mountains.


### Other inhabitants

> The region around the river marking Shaguang's eastern border with [[Hongal]] is known to be haunted by [[Namorrodor|namorrodors]], bestial [[Undead|undead]] from the [[Shadow Plane]]. Despite the Mutabi-qi roaming across much of Shaguang, there are still vast stretches of untouched land all across the region and amongst these uninhabited area giant monsters, particularly lean [[Bulette|bulettes]] and [[Death worm|death worms]] are common. The regions nearer to the Wall of Heaven are rife with [[Ash giant|ash giants]], [[Lamia|lamias]], and numerous varieties of [[Undead|undead]]. [[Elemental|Elementals]] and [[Geniekin|elemental kin]] are also rife across Shaguang.


## Religion

> Shaguang is known to be a centre of worship for followers of [[Lady Nanbyo]], [[God|goddess]] of calamities and the so called 'Widow of Suffering'. Desna, Lamashtu, and Pharasma are also commonly worshipped.
