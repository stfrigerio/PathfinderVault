> The **Black Desert** is one of the Vaults of [[Orv]], deepest layer of the [[Darklands]], and is located far below northeastern [[Garund]]. Like the other Vaults, it is a staggeringly large cavern filled with black sand deserts and [[Toxic|toxic]] [[Radiation|radiation]] hostile to all non-native life.



## Geography

> The Black Desert is located below northeastern Garund, roughly beneath the nations of [[Osirion]] and [[Thuvia]]. The Vault known as the [[Midnight Mountains]] is to the north, [[Doga-Delloth]] to the west, and [[Minos-Pashat]] to the south. There is a also a route up to the shallower layers of the Darklands.
> Its landscape is dominated by the countless of miles of black sand that give it its name. The ceiling of the Vault contains lodes of [[Blightburn|blightburn]] ore that illuminate the cavern with a dim green glow. These large concentrations of blightburn give off a poisonous radiation, making the Black Desert fatal to most living, non-native creatures.
> Lost amongst the sands are many ancient, abandoned cities built in the style of [[Ancient Osirion]].


## History

> In the [[Age of Destiny]], the Black Desert was called **Vask**, a primeval jungle with six tiny [[Aeon orb|suns]] that warded away the radiation. The [[Xulgath|xulgaths]] who called Vask home viewed it as a sacred place: a mirror of [[Gluttondark]], the [[Abyssal realm]] of their patron [[Zevgavizeb]]. In [[1 AR]], [[Aroden]] discovered the aeon orbs and, believing that [[Human|humans]] could use them better, took all but one of them to the [[Isle of Kortos]]. However, Aroden was unaware that one *aeon orb* was insufficient to maintain Vask's ecosystem. With five of the six orbs lost, the radiation soon rendered the vault a black, irradiated wasteland, forcing the xulgaths to flee. 
> In [[820 AR]], the [[Drow|drow]] of [[House Shraen]], exiled from their home city for their worship of [[Urgathoa]], entered the Black Desert. Only a small portion of the exiled house survived to the end of its journey, and those that did all did so as [[Undead|undead]] beings. The undead drow settled in the ruins of one of the xulgath cities, which they named [[Shraen]] after themselves. The drow eventually established themselves as a major power in the vault, and despite their enmity with the [[Urdefhan|urdefhan]] that roam the surrounding desert continue to rule Shraen to the present day.


## Denizens

> The Black Desert is a spawning ground for [[Purple worm|purple worms]], which are immune to the effects of the blightburn.
