> **Al-Bashir** is a [[Harpy|harpy]]-infested ruin and oasis in the central [[Pashman]] district of [[Qadira]], located on the edge of the [[Zho Mountains]] near the [[Pashman River]]. It is avoided by the caravans that pass through the mountains. Despite attempts by the Qadiran government, the hundreds of harpies who roost there have never been driven off enough to explore the vast ruins and recover the substantial treasure believed to be within. The songs of the creatures have been known to draw in entire herds of antelopes and [[Camel|camels]] to their doom.
