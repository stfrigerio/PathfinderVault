> The **Osirian Desert** is the largest but also the most sparsely populated region of [[Osirion]]. The desert is largely trackless, as its shifting sands and scouring [[Khamsin|khamsin]] winds soon erase roads, monuments and settlements. The only landmarks for navigation purposes are a few rocky outcroppings that thrust into the sky.  The region is bounded to the east by the fertile lands of [[Sphinx Basin]], to the north by the [[Inner Sea]], to the south by the [[Crook River]], and to the west by the [[Junira]]. Distinct features of the otherwise traditional sand desert are the flats of the [[Glazen Sheet|Glazen Sheets]], the isolated stretch of mountains called the [[Pillars of the Sun]], the [[Sahure Wastes]], and the [[Parched Dunes]]. Historically the Osirian Desert formed an insuperable barrier when the Osirion was weak and was adorned with new tombs and monuments when Osirion was strong. In time, the sand usually reclaims these monuments.
> The only notable settlements of this vast region are the pleasure city of [[Shiman-Sekh]] and the trade hub of [[Eto]]. Outside these two settlements, the desert is home only to nomadic [[Yerbira]] tribesfolk—clans of wanderers with ancient [[Garundi (human ethnicity)|Garundi]] bloodlines. The environment is hostile to [[Human|human]] life and, aside from hidden Yerbira springs and the few widely known oases, almost no water is to be found in the Osirian Desert.
