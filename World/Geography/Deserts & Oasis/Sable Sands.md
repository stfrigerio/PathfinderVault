Nation: Katapesh

> The **Sable Sands** are a desolate location in the southeastern deserts of [[Katapesh]] that is avoided by most travellers; the only people who visit are the occasional lost travellers who mistake it for a distant oasis.
> The Sable Sands are about 100 feet in diameter and filled with a tarry, black substance that covers the ground in strange patterns. From the midst of the tar protrude several weather-worn tombstones, though no one knows who or what may have been buried beneath the sable sands.
> The tar that permeates the ground seems to suck the happiness and positivity out of all who come near it, leeching the warmth from the very air itself. Though no [[Undead|undead]] have ever crawled from the tar-filled graves, the area does seem to attract them, drawing all sorts of living dead toward this desolate site.
