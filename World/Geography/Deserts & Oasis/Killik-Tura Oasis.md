The **Killik-Tura Oasis**, sometimes spelt **Kilik-Tura Oasis**, is located in the western reaches of the [[Footprints of Rovagug]] region of [[Osirion]], east of the [[Junira]]. The water at the small oasis is cool and plentiful. Killik-Tura Oasis is a popular stop for caravans despite the rumors that large worm-like creatures occasionally emerge from the oasis. The oasis is formed as a perfect circle, effectively bottomless, and its subterranean, water-filled tunnels branch out for miles. A fantastical tale says that the tunnels open into dry caverns filled with crawling horrors and feral [[Humanoid|humanoids]]. The truth is that Crawlbrother, a distinguished agent of the nearby [[Darklands]] [[Ghoul|ghoulish]] city of [[Nemret-Noktoria]], lurks beneath the waters.
