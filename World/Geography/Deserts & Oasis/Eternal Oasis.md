> The **Eternal Oasis** is a mysterious site in western [[Rahadoum]]. It lies just south of the [[Winding Way]] river, but no rivers flow into or out of this area of marsh and forest. Instead, thousands of springs flow forth from the ground, feeding the trees.
> The border between the Eternal Oasis and the desert is easy to see. The trees abruptly stop, giving way to a barren and waterless plain. Some feel that this sudden transition may be magical, and others whisper that the Oasis has mysterious residents that protect it from outsiders. There is almost definitely something dangerous within its woods – merchants who enter its territory are seldom seen again.
