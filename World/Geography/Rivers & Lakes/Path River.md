> The **Path River**, which is sometimes just called **The Path**, rises in the east of the [[Hold of Belkzen]], about 20 miles south-east of [[Urgir]]. It travels in a south-easterly direction and very quickly leaves the Hold, then becoming the border between the countries of [[Ustalav]] and [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] until it finally empties, after over 250 miles, into [[Lake Encarthan]].



### Tributaries

> The river has three main tributaries:

the [[Mesmos River]], which joins from out of the [[Hungry Mountains]] in Virlych;
the [[River Esk]], which joins east of [[Vigil]], the capital of Lastwall;
the [[Carabosse River]], which is the border between Virlych and Caliphas, joins at [[Hallein Town]].

### The Virlych/Lastwall border

> For about half of its entire length, the river is more accurately the border between Lastwall and the benighted Ustalavic county of [[Virlych]], wherein lies the prison of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]]: the very thing which Lastwall was created to guard. The [[Ebonwall]] forest comes down to the river's northern banks as it flows through eastern Virlych.


### The Caliphas/Lastwall border

> Downstream of Virlych, just after the Carabosse River flows into the Path, the river becomes the border between Lastwall and the county of [[Caliphas]]. During this period of its run, the river passes through the Caliphas township of [[Grayce]].
