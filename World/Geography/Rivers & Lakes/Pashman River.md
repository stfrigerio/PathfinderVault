> The **Pashman River** runs from [[Casmaron]] through the dry lands of central [[Qadira]]. Heading west, it cuts through a valley in the [[Zho Mountains]], passing the town of [[Khoka]] and the ruins of [[Al-Bashir]] before turning northwest. There it flows by the [[Northern Tapur Forest]] before reaching the capital city of [[Katheer]] and the [[Inner Sea]].
