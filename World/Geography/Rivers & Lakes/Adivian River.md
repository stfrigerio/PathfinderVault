> The **Adivian River**, also known as the **River Adivian**, is a crucial regional resource for trade and transportation in south-central [[Cheliax]], though rapids and significant waterfalls mar the route and make the river impassable to vessels with a deep draft. Despite these hazards, the river remains one of the primary means of transportation between the city of [[Westcrown]] near its mouth on the [[Inner Sea]], and the capital at [[Egorian]] on the banks of [[Lake Sorrow]].


## Geography and locations

> Of the many hazards to navigation on the Adivian, the most notable are the Three Tumble Pools, Chalraka's Tears, and [[Rikkan Falls]]. The latter were named after an [[Andoran|Andoren]] traveller who first drew the falls in [[1896 AR]] and published his journals almost 40 years later as *Travels on the Far Frontier*. Over the centuries, several attempts have been made to ease travel along the Adivian. The impressive [[Stavian Arches]] were constructed between [[3850 AR|3850]] and [[4100 AR]] and allowed even [[Ship|seagoing vessels]] to traverse the falls and gain access to [[Lake Sorrow]] and [[Egorian]]. However, saboteurs destroyed the third and largest of the arches, near the town of [[Westpool]], in [[4660 AR]], leaving only medium-sized [[Ship|ships]] and barges able to ply the river trade.
> The Adivian Bridge crosses the river a mile west-northwest of Westcrown and is a significant garrison point for the [[Hellknights|Hellknight]] [[Order of the Rack]]. Gatehouses placed at either end of the bridge defend this important crossing.
> The [[Halikarnassos Hills]] lie between the Adivian River and [[Cliffs of Fury]] to the east, and the [[Turanian Hills]] roll west of the river. The [[Rikkan Ports]]â€”[[East Rikkan]] and Westpoolâ€”are named for the [[Rikkan Falls]] north of Westcrown, themselves named for the Andoren explorer who first drew them in [[1896 AR]].


## Recent history

> The river was the site of a recent, prominent death: that of [[Infrexus Thrune]], who held the crown of Cheliax before [[Abrogail Thrune II|Abrogail II]]. Infrexus slipped under the ice of the river and drowned in the Adivian.
