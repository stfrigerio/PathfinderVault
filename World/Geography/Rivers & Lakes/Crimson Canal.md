The **Crimson Canal** is large canal connecting the [[Osirion|Osirian]] capital of [[Sothis]] to the [[River Sphinx]] a dozen miles away. Attributed by legend to [[Azghaad]] the First Pharaoh (or perhaps the [[Naga Pharaoh]] a century later), the canal allows shipping directly into central Sothis and the devotion of the River Sphinx to agriculture. Since multiple locks branch away from the main canal and traffic is observed and regulated from the canal's only island, the [[Eye of Sothis]], there is less congestion than is common in other major ports.
