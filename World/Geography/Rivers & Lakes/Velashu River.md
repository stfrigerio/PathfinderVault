> The **Velashu River** is one of the major rivers of northwestern [[Varisia]].  It winds a circuitous route from its source high in the [[Red Mountains]] past the [[Rift of Niltak]], across the wide [[Velashu Uplands]], and finally cuts through the edge of the [[Calphiak Mountains]] to flow into the [[Varisian Gulf]] at the city of [[Riddleport]]. Near the city, the Velashu takes on an unwholesome appearance and smell, thanks to the many citizens who use it as a latrine and garbage dump. A small island sits near the mouth of the Velashu within the boundaries of Riddleport: [[Maskyr's Island|Maskyrs Island]]. The islet holds [[Gaston Cromarcky|Overlord Cromarckys]] estate and the city's various administrative buildings, but is only accessible by ferry. The mouth of the Velashu itself is straddled by the immense [[Cyphergate]], whose true purpose is one of Varisia's most enduring mysteries. Beyond the Cyphergate, the river flows into Riddleport harbor.


## Inhabitants

> Small farming communities can be found near the city of Riddleport that supply the city with foodstuffs. [[Gnome|Gnomish]] traders have been known to occasionally ply this river, but how they make a living on it (considering how unpopulated the area is) is anyone's guess.
