> The **Lake of Dead Dreams** is located in the interior of the [[Nalt's Island|Nalts Island]] in the [[Shackles]]. The island's resident [[Giant|giants]] avoid the brackish waters of the lake and the Ghol-Gan ruins around it. They say the lake is haunted by [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] and those who drink from the lake suffer thereafter from terrible nightmares. [[Pterosaur|Pterosaurs]] roost in the hillsides near the lake, attacking any creatures who pass too close to their nests.
