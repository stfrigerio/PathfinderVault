> The **Dragonfly River** is a short-lived tributary of the mighty [[Sellen River]] in south-central [[Avistan]]. It begins high in the [[Five Kings Mountains]], approximately 60 miles southeast of the capital of [[Highhelm Militia]] and flows from there in a general southeasterly direction south of the [[Andoran|Andoren]] town of [[Caldamin]] where it enters the [[Verduran Forest]]. After approximately 120 miles, it flows into the Sellen south of the town of [[Bellis]].
