> The **Nicklecross River** rises in [[Lake Redleaf]] and flows 50 miles south to meet the [[Detstach River]], forming the border between the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] counties of [[Versex]] and [[Varno]] throughout its length. The river flows through the [[Forest of Veils]] for most of its course. The [[Kansorro River]] is the main tributary of the Nicklecross, and meets the Nicklecross River south of the town of Redleaf.
