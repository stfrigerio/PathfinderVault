 The River Styx.
> The **River Styx** (pronounced STIKS) is an [[Plane|interplanar]] river that originates on the plane of [[Abaddon]], but snakes its way throughout the [[Outer Sphere]] and touches on the planes of [[Axis]], [[Hell]], the [[Abyss]], and the [[Maelstrom]], before finally pooling at the base of [[Pharasma's Spire|Pharasmas Spire]].



## In the Abyss

> The town known as [[Taste of Anguish]] is located on a branch of the Styx in the Abyss.


## In Abaddon

> On the plane of Abaddon, the Styx is the undisputed realm of the [[Four Horsemen|Horseman of Death]], [[Charon]]. It is also home to the vicious [[Hydrodaemon|hydrodaemons]], who lurk beneath its surface, ready to attack anyone who survives the deleterious effects of the river. The surface is patrolled by [[Thanadaemon|thanadaemons]], who pilot their [[Ship|skiffs]] and have even been known to ferry travelers across the Styx.
> The Styx also feeds the [[Plaguemere]], the colossal swamps where [[Apollyon]] the Horseman of Pestilence resides.


## In Hell

> As it winds its way through Hell, the Styx feeds the swamps of [[Stygia]], the plane's fifth layer.
