> **Hopespring** is a rich stream of clear water in the small town of [[Trunau]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. The stream wells up from deep within the stone, forms a waterfall of pure water and fills the town reservoir before goes again underground through cracks in the stone and resurfaces in a creek miles away. Originally known as just "**Hillspring**", Hopespring is the reason the town was founded in this place and the key to its survival. None can say whether the spring is natural or magical but a mute [[Elf|elven]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] known as [[Silvermane]] quietly watches over the spring and its reservoir. He has resided on this hill and slept near the spring since before the town of Trunau was settled. He rarely communicates with anyone but sometimes has been seen conversing with [[Halgra]] via a form of sign language. The few occasions upon which he performs [[Magic|magic]], healing a dying child or calling lighting down on [[Orc|orc]] raiders, earn him respect from the grateful residents. A common rumor says that Silvermane is the only survivor of the [[Council of Thorns]], an ancient druidic circle the members of which faced the unstoppable orc horde in [[4237 AR]] and martyred themselves to protect what is now the [[Ghostlight Marsh]].
