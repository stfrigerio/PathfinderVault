> The source of the **Raiteso River** is [[Lake Raiteso]] nestled in the southern [[Hungry Mountains]] in the north of the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Caliphas]]. The river runs nearly due south out of the mountains and, once clear of the mountains, is bordered on its western shore by the [[Albria Woods]]. After some 50 miles, the Raiteso is joined by the [[Droa River]], where it leaves the Albria Woods and turns east to flow for about 20 miles until it exits into [[Avalon Bay]] at the 'City of the Senses': [[Vauntil]].
> Along its banks may be found many craftsmen in small communities plying their expertise and trading predominantly with the rich of the [[Caliphas city|city of Caliphas]]. The craftsmen include [[Alcoholic beverages|vinters]], perfumers and quarriers of the alabaster found in the region.
