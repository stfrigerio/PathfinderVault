> The **Endowhar River** spends almost all of its length flowing through the [[Fierani Forest]] of the [[Elf|elven]] kingdom of [[Kyonin]]. It begins near the [[Moonpool Causeways]] of eastern Kyonin and flows westward past the capital of [[Iadara]]. Shortly thereafter it is joined by the [[Kyonin River]] and from there turns northward. It passes out of the Fierani onto the plains of northern Kyonin before emptying into the [[West Sellen River]].
