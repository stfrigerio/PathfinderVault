> The **Redwool River** rises around the border of the [[Hold of Belkzen]] and [[Ustalav]] and flows east, through the [[Bleakwall]], into the county of [[Canterwall]] in [[Ustalav]]. It flows south of [[Lake Lias]] and the town of [[Ravengro]], then turns slightly to a more north-easterly direction to enter the [[Vistear River]], as a tributary, some miles south of the [[Ghoul|ghoul]]-blighted [[Clover's Crossing|Clovers Crossing]]. In all, the river is some eighty miles long.
