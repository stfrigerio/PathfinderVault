> The **Usk River** is the central waterway of the nation of [[Nidal]] in western [[Avistan]].  It has its source in [[Varisia]] and [[Nirmathas]] [[Bloodsworn Vale]] in the southern [[Mindspin Mountains]], and travels south past the [[Barrowmoor]] and through the [[Atteran Ranches]]. It is next joined out of the east by the [[Gjurn River]] that flows down from the city of [[Glimmerhold]] before reaching [[Usk Lake]]. The only outflow from Usk Lake is still named the Usk River, and it now travels west through the [[Uskwood]] and past the capital of [[Pangolais]] and the [[House of Lies]] before emptying into [[Nisroch Bay]] at the city of [[Nisroch]]. The Usk River bisects that city both geographically and economically: the rich live in the districts north of the Usk, while the poor huddle south of it.
> The Usk River is one of the few partially navigable rivers that lead into the heart of the Mindspin Mountains. From the Bloodsworn Vale down into the lowlands of Nidal, the river cuts a deep ravine through the mountains.
> A coven of [[Green hag|green hags]] known as the River Maidens impose sinister demands on those who reach the Usk River's headwaters. The hags guard a series of tunnels that connect the river's headwaters to the Bloodsworn Vale. A large number of minions serve the hags.
