> Unusually amongst the vaults of [[Orv]], the [[Midnight Mountains]] sometimes experience rainfall. Water seeps down from the [[Dying Sea]] in [[Sekamina]] and sometimes falls on the mountains as rain. The rainwater drains into a nameless lake, and then flows through the vault and into the neighbouring vault of [[Ilvarandin]], and into the [[Sightless Sea]].
> At some point it becomes a true underground river, and is known in Ilvarandin as the **Irikusk River**. It flows past the [[Intellect devourer|intellect devourer]] enclave of [[High Ilvarandin]], and is a major route for trade between them and the outside world â€“ in particular the black galleys of the [[Denizen of Leng|Denizens of Leng]] can be seen on the river.
> The river eventually reaches the sea at the Ilvarandin district of [[Duskport]]. Here, at the river's widest part, the northern bank is lined with piers and warehouses.
