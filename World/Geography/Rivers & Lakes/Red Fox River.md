> The **Red Fox River** is a tributary of the [[Gullik River]] that flows through southeastern [[Irrisen]]. It originates in the northern [[Kodar Mountains]] and heads northward before turning eastward near the town of [[Nadzieja Lato]]. After flowing eastward for under 100 miles, it turns north and eventually flows into the Gullik. For its entire length, the Red Fox forms the border between Irrisen and the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]].
