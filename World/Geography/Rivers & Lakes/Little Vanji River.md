> The **Vanji River** is one of the larger of the many, many rivers that cut through the verdant rain forests of the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. The Vanji River starts at the ruins of the city of [[Kho]] high in the [[Barrier Wall|Barrier Wall mountains]]. From there it flows westward out of the highlands into the plains north of the [[Mwangi Jungle]] and is joined by the Razorstone River. Once it enters the jungle it turns southward and is joined by the Ounga and the [[Bdonge River|River Bdonge]]. It then turns westward again and flows into [[Lake Ocota]]. The Vanji is the only outflow of Lake Ocata as it heads out of the Mwangi Jungle past [[Nantambu]], and all the way down to [[Rechiend's Plains|Rechiends Plains]] and into the [[Fever Sea]]. By the time it reaches the ocean, its waters have taken on a reddish tint from the iron-rich clay deposits) that gives its name to the infamous free port of [[Bloodcove]].


## Gold

> The [[Aspis Consortium]] discovered significant gold deposits within the mud of the lower river. This has led to speculation that even bigger deposits may exist upstream, and the Consortium has established supply and trade depots on the river at [[Whitebridge Station]] and [[Nightfall Station]], ignoring the objections of the local [[Ekujae]] tribe.
