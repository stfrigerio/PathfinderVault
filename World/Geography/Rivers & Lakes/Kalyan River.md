> The **Kalyan River** runs most of the length of the [[Golden Basin]] region of the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]]. Starting in the [[Johar Mountains]] near the holy peak [[Adarparbat]], believed favoured by the [[Sun|sun]] [[Deity|goddess]] [[Sarenrae]], the Kalyan then flows down into the heartland of the Golden Basin. The river flows past the enormous statue of the [[Psychic|psychic]] [[Vanitapati]] known as the [[Devi]], which sits on an island in the middle of the river. Finally, the Kalyan River drains into [[Sona Lake]] where the [[Gold|gold]] flecks the river's water has collected along its journey sometimes give the lake a wondrous golden tint.
