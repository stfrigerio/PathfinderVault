> The **Profit's Flow** is a river that runs most of its course through the nation of [[Druma]] in central [[Avistan]]. It begins in the western branch of the [[Five Kings Mountains]], just north of the [[Isger|Isgeri]] city of [[Dustpawn]]. From there, it flows east through the [[Palakar Forest]], joining with the [[Great Goldpan River]] at the town of [[Macridi]]. From there, it flows north out of the Palakar over the plain of Druma, finally emptying into the [[Gulf of Accord]] (part of [[Lake Encarthan]]) at the Drumish capital of [[Kerse]]. A group of [[Mephistopheles]] worshipers known as the Aerie Club maintains a retreat along the river's banks, where the normally secretive cult can worship openly.
