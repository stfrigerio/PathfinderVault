> The **Dagger River** is a tributary of the fabled [[Sellen River]] that winds its way through much of north-eastern [[Avistan]]. The Dagger has its origin in central [[Numeria]], near [[Gorum Pots]]. From there it travels south past the town of [[Iadenveigh]] before crossing into the [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] called the [[Protectorate of the Black Marquis]]. There it continues its southern journey through the capital town of [[Deadbridge]] before flowing into the Sellen on the border between [[Daggermark]] and [[Loric Fells]].
