> The **Carabosse River** is a tributary of the [[Path River]]. It has its spring in the [[Hungry Mountains]] south-west of [[Lake Raiteso]] and meanders its course in a south-westerly direction for about 70 miles. For almost its entire length, the Carabosse acts as the border between the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] counties of [[Amaans]] and [[Caliphas]]. Only in its final few miles before flowing into the Path does the river become the border between Caliphas and blighted county of [[Virlych]], at which stage it has the Ebonwood forest on its western bank. It joins the Path River north of the settlement of [[Hallein Town]] in [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]].
