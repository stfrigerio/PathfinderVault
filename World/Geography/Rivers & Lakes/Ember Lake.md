> **Ember Lake** is a freshwater lake located in central [[Varisia]], bordering the [[Malgorian Mountains]] to the east, and the rolling plains of the [[Lost Coast]] to the west. It is fed by both the [[Lampblack River|Lampblack]] and the [[Malgorian River|Malgorian]] rivers, in addition to numerous hot springs, causing the lake to steam in colder months.  The villages of [[Wolf's Ear|Wolfs Ear]], [[Galduria]], and [[Nybor]] sit along its western shore, and these communities do a brisk trade in grain from local farms, and lumber from the nearby [[Churlwood]] and [[Sanos Forest]]. On the opposite side of Ember Lake stands the forbidding castle of [[Viperwall]], a place greatly avoided by the local population. The lake is home to a fascinating [[Salamander|salamander]]-like creature known as the charig, whose bodies glow with an inner phosphorescence. Schools of these creatures can be seen swimming about at night, making strange patterns that some claim have greater meaning.
