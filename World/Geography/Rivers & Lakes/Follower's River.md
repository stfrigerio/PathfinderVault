> The **Follower's River** runs almost the entire length of the northern reaches of [[Xopatl]] just south of the mountains that make up the Xopatl's northern border. The Follower's River passes by three cities that are known together as the Followerâ€™s Rests, these cities are [[Orjotoro]], Tulaupan and Ziplatna. The Valley of the Chosen Children lies along the length of the Follower's River where the Naurepzi River branches off of it.
