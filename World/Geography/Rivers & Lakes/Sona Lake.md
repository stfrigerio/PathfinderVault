> **Sona Lake** sits at the end of the [[Kalyan River]] in the [[Vudra|Vudran]] region of [[Golden Basin]]. Tiny particles of [[Gold|gold]] are carried down the Kalyan River and settle on the bottom of Sona Lake that give the lake an incredible golden glow when the light is just right. The capital city of Vudra, [[Indapatta]], lies on the north-eastern coast of the lake.
