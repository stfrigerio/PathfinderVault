> The **Nosam River** is a relatively short river found entirely within the militaristic nation of [[Molthune]]. It begins in the southwest of that country, south of the [[Backar Forest]], and just east of the [[Trilmsgitt Towers]]. From there it flows in a generally northeasterly direction, following the curve of the [[Menador Mountains]]. It continues south of the Backar, past the city of [[Cettigne]] and the capital of [[Canorate]], where it is joined by the [[Hungry Maw River]] flowing in from the east. At Canorate it also turns north, flowing to the west of the [[Shrikewood]] until it empties into [[Lake Encarthan]] at the port city of [[Korholm]].
