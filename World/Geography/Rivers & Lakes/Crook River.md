> The **Crook River** is one of the two main tributaries to the [[River Sphinx]] in [[Osirion]].  It begins in the foothills of the [[Barrier Wall]] mountains in southwestern Osirion and drains the entire [[Brazen Frontier]] region, flowing at a steady but sluggish pace in a generally easterly direction for approximately 200 miles before joining the [[Asp River|Asp]] to form the Sphinx. The lands at either side of the Crook are flat floodplains, heavily farmed near the city of [[Ipeq]]. Elsewhere, the plains are mostly marches and dangerous because of the [[Crocodile|crocodiles]] and [[Hippopotamus|hippopotamuses]].
> The easy crossings are only two: the [[Shallows of Ipeq]] and the [[Khopesh Span]] bridge to the east. At [[Oxjaw Falls]], to the west, travelers on foot may also try a treacherous pass across the river. The only other way to cross the river is to find fisher folk willing to ferry the travelers at some of the infrequent river settlements. Upriver the traders use [[Ship|skiffs]] capable to travel through the stretches of rapids which are used as ideal ambush points  for [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]] and other raiders.
