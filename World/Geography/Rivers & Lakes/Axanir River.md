> The **Axanir River** rises in the southern [[Shattered Range]] of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] (where in some cases it forms a natural boundary with [[Geb's Rest]]). From there it flows past the [[Vangeline Pass]] in first a southeasterly, and then an easterly direction. The various major tributaries meet up and flow south of the [[Axan Wood]] into the [[Obari Ocean]] at [[Mechitar]]. Along its route it merges with the [[Copper River]], Tulger River, and the [[Jaadja River]] before it flows into the [[Obari Ocean]] at the capital of [[Mechitar]].
