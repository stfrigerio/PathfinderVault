> The **Great Pool** is the largest mineral spring in [[Djeneg]]. It is private and is a favorite of nobles who visit the springs due to its beauty and seclusion. Privacy and luxury are ensured as nobles are provided with deaf attendants. There are, however, limits to privacy and some portions of the spring's privacy walls do not provide as much defense against eavesdropping as might otherwise be expected.
