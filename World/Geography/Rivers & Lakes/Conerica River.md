> The **Conerica River** begins high in the northernmost [[Five Kings Mountains]] near the settlement of [[Dustpawn]], close to the [[Isger]]â€“[[Druma]] border. From here it flows westward into the Isgeri plains, past the towns of [[Saringallow]] and [[Logas]] before entering [[Cheliax]] at its confluence with the [[Keld River]] near the town of [[Misarias]]. Past this settlement, the Conerica takes on a new name: the [[Iseld River]].
> The Conerica is navigable by river boats along much of its length, and is part of a major Chelishâ€“Druman trade route known as the [[Conerica Straits]], which provides much of the region's prosperity.
> Two of its tributaries, the [[Grackle River|Grackle]] and [[Skunk River Isger|Skunk Rivers]], flow through the [[Dustpawn]] hinterlands, along with the smaller Dustpawn Creek.
