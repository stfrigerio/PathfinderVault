> The **Shrike River** is a tributary to the mighty [[Sellen River]] that flows through the [[River Kingdoms]]. The river is named for the numerous flocks of birds that nest along its length.
> The river begins high in the [[Icerime Peaks]], the mountains that separate [[Brevoy]] on the continent of [[Avistan]] from the wild land of [[Iobaria]] in [[Casmaron]]. From its many smaller tributaries it pools in a large lake in the [[Hills of Nomen]] and then flows generally westward past the city of [[Restov]]. From there it turns southwestward through the [[Stolen Lands]], past the [[Narlmarches]], and into the [[East Sellen River]] at the city of [[Mivon city|Mivon]].
> Although it connects Brevoy with the Stolen Lands, it makes for a poor trade route as the waterway is interrupted by two waterfalls, thus making safe travel between the two regions impossible.
