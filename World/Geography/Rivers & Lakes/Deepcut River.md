> The **Deepcut River** runs west to east in [[Nirmathas]] for about 50 miles. It rises in the foothills of the [[Mindspin Mountains]] near Hurlandrun and flows to the [[Marideth River]], joining it  at [[Phaendar]]. The river is lined with the remains of [[Cheliax|Chelish]] watchtowers marking every fifth mile.
