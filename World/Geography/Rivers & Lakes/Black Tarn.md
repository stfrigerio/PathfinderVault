> **Black Tarn** is an infamous mountain lake on the [[Ironbound Islands|Ironbound Island]] of [[Dragon's Rib|Dragons Rib]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]].


## Inhabitants

> The people of the region have long wondered who lives in the Black Tarn's depths, and have speculated that it could be a [[Troll|troll]] king, a [[Fey|fey]] [[Sorcerer|sorceress]] or an ancient [[Linnorm|linnorm]]. All have agreed, however, that a mighty trove of treasure lies at the bottom of the lake. The rumors of the lake were strengthened when the [[Ulfen]] hero [[Arnlaugr|Arnlaugr the Fearless]] donned his famed linnorm-scale armor and his [[Magic|magical]] [[Sword|sword]] *[[Rixbrand]]* to seek his fortune at the bottom of the Tarn and was never heard from again.
> The truth is that the Black Tarn is home to the ancient [[Water orm|water orm]] named Blackfin, along with [[Valdis]], a [[Rusalka|rusalka]] [[Witch|witch]] who is the fey ruler of the island of Dragon's Rib. Arnlaugr the Fearless was killed when he confronted Valdis, and transformed into a watery [[Undead|undead]] creature known as a [[Draugr|draugr]].
