> The **Old Bridge** is an ancient crossing of the [[Andoshen River]] located in [[Riverford]], a small town located about 200 miles north of the [[Andoren]] capital of [[Almas]]. As the only place wide enough for an entire army to cross the Andoshen in the region, the bridge is a vital strategic location to Andoran, which has stationed a small contingent of [[Eagle Knights]] at the nearby [[Old Bridge Tower]].
