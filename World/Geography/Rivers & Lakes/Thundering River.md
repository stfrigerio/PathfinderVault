> The **Thundering River** rises in a northern branch of the [[Kodar Mountains]] just west of the [[Hope Lost|Mines of Hope Lost]] in [[Irrisen]]. From there it meanders some 220 miles west gradually turning north-west and then north. It acts as the border between Irrisen and the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] for the first half of its course. Twenty miles after the river leaves the border and enters the Linnorm Kingdom of [[Southmoor]] it meets its tributary, the [[Summermelt River]] within the [[Grungir Forest]] at [[Delmon's Glen|Delmons Glen]]. After travelling through the forest, the river becomes the border between the Linnorm Kingdoms of Grungir Forest and [[Hagreach]] for about twenty-five miles. Finally, for its last thirty-five miles, the river is the border between Hagreach and the [[Thanelands]] before it flows into the mighty [[Rimeflow River]] as a tributary. On its journey the river passes the settlements of [[Whiterook]], Delmon's Glen, [[Losthome]] and [[Eldentre]].
