> The **Lampblack River** flows out of [[Lake Skotha]] in [[Varisia]]'s [[Storval Plateau]] in a southwesterly direction, pours in a mighty waterfall over the edge of the [[Storval Rise]], winds its way through the green pasture land of the southern [[Curchain Hills]] and the town of [[Ravenmoor]], on past the [[Churlwood]], before emptying into [[Ember Lake]] at the village of [[Wolf's Ear|Wolfs Ear]].
> The [[Shriikirri-Quah]] or [[Shoanti]] Hawk Clan consider the Lampblack below the Storval Rise to be the southern border of their territory.  Although they are certainly not fond of the descendants of the [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelaxian]] immigrants which make up the majority of Varisia's population, they are not in open, armed conflict with them.
