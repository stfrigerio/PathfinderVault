> The **Asp River** is one of the two main tributaries to the [[River Sphinx]] in [[Osirion]]. It begins at the [[Brazen Peaks]] in the south, flows towards the north and joins the [[Crook River]] to form the Sphinx. As well as being a tributary for Osirion's most important river, the Asp also provides water and river access to the twin cities of [[Tephu]] and [[Wati]].
