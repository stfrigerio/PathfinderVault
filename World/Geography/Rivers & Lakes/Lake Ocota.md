**Lake Ocota** is the largest freshwater body of water in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] and lies at the heart of the [[Mwangi Jungle]]. Numerous rivers flow into it, and the [[Vanji River]] flows out of the lake, reaching the [[Fever Sea]] at [[Bloodcove]]. The lake is a hundred miles across.


## Fauna

> The lake is home to creatures unknown elsewhere. These include the [[Zinza|zinza]], swift, flightless birds with reptile-like teeth. There are also more dangerous creatures, long-necked aquatic predators that seem to be a throwback to ancient times. These beasts are happy to snatch unwary prey from boats, docks or shores; they can also sometimes be found wandering the region's rivers. These creatures are in fact members of two separate species of aquatic predators: a reclusive population of [[Mokele-mbembe|mokele-mbembes]] that rarely leave the deeper parts of the lake and numerous [[Crocodile|crocodile]]-headed [[Water orm|water orms]]. The orms are the offspring of a larger, ancient specimen known as the Fetid God, which lives in the center of the lake and rarely surfaces.
> The **blanchess urchin** is found in the lake and its ink is known to be used by Mwangi mystics to bring forth the seventh flavour.


## Places of interest

> The dreaded city of [[Usaro]] stands on the lake's southern shore. There are also numerous other ruined cities. At the heart of the lake is a tall rock known as the [[Spire of Destiny]].
