> **Glacier Lake** is located at the geographic center of [[Irrisen]]. It is a huge expanse of ice over 100 miles wide. The [[Frozen Road River]] flows in from the north and the [[Marbleflow River]] flows in from the south, while the [[Rimeflow River]] flows west out of the lake.
> Rich wildlife inhabits the frigid lake. Glacier Lake is a substantial food source in Irrisen. The average citizen's diet is formed from trout, sturgeon, pike, and whitefish occasionally supplemented with cold-water molluscs and [[Squid|squid]]. Every village and town on the shores of the lake maintains a fleet of fishing vessels. Colonies of freshwater seals and [[Walrus|walruses]] are common on the unsettled shores. Hunters bring meat blubber, skins and tusks harvested from these creatures.
> The capital city of [[Whitethrone]] sits on the cliffs of Glacier Lake's northeastern shore and [[Elvanna|Queen Elvannas]] Royal Palace is located atop a 200-foot-tall ice spire rising up from the lake.
> Most fisherfolk work as close to the shore as possible as the remote center of the Glacier Lake is notorious for unexpected storms and hidden terrors. Many underwater cave complexes are home to amphibious boreal breeds, including isolated tribes of hostile [[Locathah|locathahs]] , vicious freshwater [[Merrow|merrows]], and brutal [[Scrag|scrags]].


## Notable Inhabitants

> - [[Yalah|Yalah the Pale]] is a [[Rusalka|rusalka]] [[Witch|witch]] inhabiting the center of the lake. A 40 years' old treaty between Elvanna and the Yalah, requires that a raft with three unfortunate male [[Jadwiga]] children be set adrift at the center of the lake on the eve of [[Pjallarane Day]] (1 [[Abadius]]) every year.
> - [[Tirchagac current|Tirchagac]], the warlord of the [[Scrag Deep tribe]].
