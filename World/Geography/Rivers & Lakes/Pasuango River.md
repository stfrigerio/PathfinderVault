The Pasuango River, at center.
> 
The **Pasuango River** flows along the southern edge of the [[Screaming Jungle]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. Just before its confluence with the [[Korir River|Upper Korir River]], it passes the settlement of [[Mzali]] and provides that settlement with a fertile flood plain. West of the confluence, the waters flow into the [[Lake of Vanished Armies]].
