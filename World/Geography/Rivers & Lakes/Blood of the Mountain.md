> **The Blood of the Mountain** is a lava lake under the volcano [[Droskar's Crag|Droskars Crag]] that lies between two ancient subterranean [[Dwarf|dwarven]] transportation routes, now cut off from their original destinations. Both are connected by tunnels to the [[Darklands]]. The lava lake lies within an impressive natural cavern nearly 200 feet x 200 feet and 100 feet high. It is lit by the glow of roiling magma, while thick curls of smoke and ash waft toward the ceiling. It is the lair of the [[Magma dragon|magma dragon]] [[Moschabbatt]].
