> **Lake Fors** is the lower of the two lakes that make up the [[Northern Cascade]] of the [[Brazen Peaks]]. Lake Fors is not only the lower of the lakes but it is also the smaller of the two, and is separated from the larger [[Lake Vorn]] by the spectacular waterfall of [[Viper's Tongue|Vipers Tongue]]. Though smaller, Lake Fors is less dangerous than Lake Vorn, as there are no rumours of lake monsters lurking within Fors's depths. Despite its safety it is still remote, and boats floating upon Lake Fors's surface are a very rare sight.
