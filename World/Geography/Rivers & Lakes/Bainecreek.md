> The **Bainecreek** was a small tributary of the [[Millrun River]] both of which flowed in the [[Furcina]] area of the county of [[Ardeal]], [[Ustalav]]; they met at [[Crossbough Bridge]]. After the [[War Without Rivals]], the whole area became a wasteland known as [[The Furrows|the Furrows]], and since then the dried-up Bainecreek contains only dust and a [[Poison|poisonous]], [[Disease|diseased]] sludge with a predatory character.
