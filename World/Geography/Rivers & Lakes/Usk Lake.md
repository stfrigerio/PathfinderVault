> **Usk Lake** is the largest freshwater lake in the shadowy land of [[Nidal]]. Located in the northeast of the country between the [[Uskwood]] and the [[Mindspin Mountains]], it is fed by the [[Usk River|Usk]] and [[Sulfur River|Sulfur Rivers]]. It is drained by the Usk as it continues southwestward under the shaded boughs of the Uskwood toward the capital of [[Pangolais]].


## Resources

> The lake provides a unique white [[Fish|fish]], presumably changed by the shadowy nature of the country, as a major source of food for the Nidalese population.
