> The **West Sellen River** is part of the vast [[Sellen River]] system but is, in itself, a long and important river forming the boundaries between nations for its entire 1,200-mile length.



## The Worldwound and Mendev border

> The West Sellen rises in the far north of [[Avistan]] and forms the border between the demon-infested [[Worldwound]] and the country set against the [[Demon|demon]] incursion: [[Mendev]]. Through this phase it flows in a south-westerly direction. While in Mendev it passes the city of [[Kenabres]].


## Ustalav and Numeria border

> The West Sellen provides the eastern national boundary of [[Ustalav]]: in the north with Numeria and, in the south, with the [[River Kingdoms]].
> The river enters Ustalav at [[Lake Prophyria]], in county [[Sinaria]], where its waters are increased by the entry of the [[Moutray River]]; there it turns to a more southerly flow. With the [[Babelwood]] on its western shore, it enters the county of [[Barstoi]] and is joined by its tributary, the [[Delgavia River]], north of the settlement of [[Vische]]. North of [[Sturnidae]] the river changes course again to a more easterly flow and is joined by the [[Kingfisher River]] at the border of Barstoi with the county of [[Varno]]. Shortly after entering Varno, the river once more resumes a southerly flow and meets its tributary, the [[Seaugustae River]]. Just east of [[Lake Laruba]] the border of Numeria veers eastwards and the river now becomes the border between Ustalav and the [[River Kingdoms]].


## Ustalav and the River Kingdoms border

> South of Lake Laruba, the River Kingdoms form the eastern bank of the West Sellen River. In this phase the river is joined by its tributary, the [[Twinetongue River]]. Eventually, the border of Ustalav turns westward and the river now becomes the border between [[Razmiran]] and the River Kingdoms, as the river continues southwards.
