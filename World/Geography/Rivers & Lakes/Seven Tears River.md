> The **Seven Tears River** is a relatively short tributary of the [[Sellen River]] in the barbarian kingdom of [[Numeria]]. It begins near the town of [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Torch]] and flows in a generally southward direction, eventually forming part of the border between Numeria and the [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Loric Fells]] to the south. From there it flows eastward and joins the Sellen.
