> The **Kantele River** is a tributary of the [[East Sellen River]] that begins in the foothills of the [[Galt|Galtan]] [[Fog Peaks]], west of [[Stavintower]]. From there it flows in a general westerly direction, skirting the southern edge of the [[Boarwood]] before joining the [[Stormflood River]] southeast of the capital of [[Isarn]].
