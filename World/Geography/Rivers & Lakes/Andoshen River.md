> The **Andoshen River** (sometimes referred to as the **Andossan**) is the wide central waterway of the nation of [[Andoran]].



## Geography

> The source of the Andoshen lies in the foothills of the [[Five Kings Range]] in the far northeast of the country. From there it flows southwest along the border of the highlands, joining the [[Foam River]] just southeast of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]]. There it turns south through the [[Carpenden Plains]] and eventually passes the town of [[Riverford]]. From there it passes through the capital of [[Almas]] (where it is joined by the much smaller [[Moulton River|Moulton]], [[Kernite River|Kernite]], and [[Tamuth River|Tamuth Rivers]]) and into the [[Inner Sea]].


### Settlements

> - [[Almas]]
> - [[Riverford]]

## Economy

> As the nation's central waterway, it is heavily used to transport goods (such as lumber and [[Wine|wine]]) from the heartland to the coast for export. Flat-bottomed transport [[Ship|ships]] and barges carry the passengers and goods. They occasionally come under bandit attack, but given the large numbers of burly lumberjacks that accompany these vessels, they are generally quite capable of defending themselves.
