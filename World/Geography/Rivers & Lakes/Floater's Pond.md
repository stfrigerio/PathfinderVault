> Located near the vast [[Salt|salt]] flats of the [[Sabkha]] in central [[Katapesh]], **Floater's Pond** is an oasis unlike any other, as it is a salt water oasis. The water seeps through the ground into the salt-laden sand, but thanks to the constant seeping water it never dries out. The water instead becomes inundated with salt.
> Floater's Pond is so salty that it is almost impossible to sink in it, but that also means the pond is completely uninhabitable to aquatic [[Plant|plants]] or [[Animal|animals]]. Sometimes desperate [[Pesh|pesh]] farmers come to Floater's Pond to harvest valuable nagri salt, but the process is time consuming because the farmer has to soak a sheet in the salty water and wait until it dries and leaves behind the valuable salt.
