> The **River of Knives** is the largest river on the [[Shark Island]] in the [[Shackles]]. It is a fast flowing river fed by many smaller waterways. Its banks host giant [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Frog|frogs]] and leeches, [[Jaguar|jaguars]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spiders]]. A large family of [[Harpy|harpies]] with copper skin and green feathers, known as the [[Whetted Brood]] also resides in the hills around the river and its tributaries. It is said that treasures are buried along the river's banks.
