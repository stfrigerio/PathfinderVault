> Residing among the swamps of [[Hooktongue Slough]], the murky gray lake known as **Lake Hooktongue** snakes through the already water-drenched landscape. Arguably the lake and the swamp are the same, with the lake simply forming the deeper reaches of the swamp. The lake emerges only along its western region, with the rest of the lake covered with hemlock and willow.
> Lake Hooktongue has a deadly reputation because of its most famous resident: the Hooktongue Orm, a legendary giant black snake of enormous size that haunts the lake's waters. Dismissed by many as myth and rumor, locals to the region know it to be anything but, and frequently offer sacrifices to it when trapping near the lake's pebbled shore.
