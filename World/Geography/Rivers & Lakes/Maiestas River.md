> The **Maiestas River** flows from north to south in western Cheliax and serves as a informal natural border between the rebellious west province and the heartland of Cheliax. From its source near [[Mount Rinia]] it flows past the ruins at [[Collapsed Halls]] and the regional capitol of [[Belde]] before reaching the [[Arcadian Ocean]] at the [[Pillars of Anferita]].
