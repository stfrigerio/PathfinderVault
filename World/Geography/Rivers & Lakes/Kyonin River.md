> The **Kyonin River** begins in the [[Five Kings Range]] of southwestern [[Kyonin]]. It flows northwards past the town of [[Riverspire]] before passing into the [[Fierani Forest]], where it spends the rest of its run. It turns eastward north of the [[Century Root]] and finally empties into the [[Endowhar River]] west of the capital city of [[Iadara]].
