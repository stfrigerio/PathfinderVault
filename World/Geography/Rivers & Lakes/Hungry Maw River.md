> The relatively minor **Hungry Maw River** flows between the dangerous [[Shrikewood]] (to the north) and the [[Menador Mountains]] (to the south) in eastern [[Molthune]]. Less than 100 miles in length, it begins in the foothills of the Menadors, flowing almost due west, until it joins the larger [[Nosam River]] at the capital city of [[Canorate]]. Near the Shrikewood, large tribes of [[Mite|mites]] and [[Kobold|kobolds]] are said to live along its banks.
