> The **Noyrus River**, or the **Runningflow**, provides one of the few routes into the heart of [[Norinor]]. Barges ply the river between the city of [[Kridorn]], which lies at the river's mouth on the [[Castrovin Sea]], and the many small settlements in the forest, such as [[Volod]], allowing those who live in the forest's depths to trade with the outside world. A [[Koloran road]] crosses the river at the ancient [[Cyclops|cylopean]] bridge known as [[Kridorthrost]].
