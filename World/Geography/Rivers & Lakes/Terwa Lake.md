The region around Terwa Lake.
> 
**Terwa Lake** is on the northern edge of [[Rechiend's Plains|Rechiends Plains]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]], close to the region's borders with the [[Shackles]] and the [[Sodden Lands]]. The [[Terwa River]] flows into and out of the lake.


## Description

> The lake actually fills the caldera of a dormant [[Volcano|volcano]]. Volcanic gas leaks into the lake, where it is absorbed into the cold waters at the bottom of the lake. On occasionâ€”for example as the result of an earthquakeâ€”this gas is released, forming a deadly cloud which kills all living things within miles of the lake. Numerous settlements have been built near the lake, only to be wiped out by the sudden catastrophe. There are no current settlements, but the largest of the ruins is [[Bloodsalt]].
