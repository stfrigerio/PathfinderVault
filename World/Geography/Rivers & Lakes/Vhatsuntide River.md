> The **Vhatsuntide River**  is one of the largest rivers in [[Ustalav]].



## Source

> The river begins its long course in lonely [[Ulcazar]] amongst the forlorn peaks of the [[Hungry Mountains]] in [[Lake Kavapesta]], flowing out north-west from that lake into [[Amaans]] county.


## Amaans / Ardeal border

> From there it winds its way down into the heartland of [[Ustalav]] entering next the county of [[Ardeal]], where it forms the border between that county and the county of Amaans after its confluence with the [[Senir River]]. While flowing through Ardeal, the banks of the Vhatsuntide are littered with the huge, glamorous estates of the social elite of Ustalav, now fallen into ruin as they were abandoned when the capital was moved to distant [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]]. The river soon reaches the former capital of [[Ardis]] once the home of art and culture in Ustalav, though this is now just a distant memory.


## Ardeal / Canterwall border

> Past Ardis, the river joins the [[Orphield River]] where the Vhatsuntide becomes the border between Ardeal and [[Canterwall]] county. Through most of this period of its flow, the river has the [[Sclerain Swamp]] on its western shore.


## Ardeal / Lozeri border

> The river is joined by the [[Vistear River]] at [[Chastel]] and, from that point downstream, the river now becomes the border between Ardeal and the county of [[Lozeri]].


## Lozeri / Odranto border

> At the point where the Vhatsuntide is joined by the [[River of Scales]], it finally leaves Ardeal and becomes the border between the counties of Lozeri and [[Odranto]]. By this point the river is flowing due north and has the Foxwall forest on its eastern shore. The Foxwall forest peters out north of the confluence with the [[Brookwall]] river. Finally, at [[Ardagh]], the Vhatsuntide River flows into the mighty [[Moutray River]].
