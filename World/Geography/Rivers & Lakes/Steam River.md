> The **Steam River** flows from [[Varisia]]'s [[Kodar Mountains]] in a general westerly direction. It empties into [[Lake Stormunder]] before continuing west, forming the southern border of the [[Nolands]]. It also passes the abandoned [[Cheliax|Chelaxian]] fortress of [[Brinewall]] before emptying into [[Bunyip Bay]] and the [[Steaming Sea]]. Bunyip Bay is named after the fearsome seal-like predator known as [[Bunyip|bunyips]] that are known to enter the Steam River hunting for prey.
