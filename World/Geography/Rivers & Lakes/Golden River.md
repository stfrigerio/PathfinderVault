> The **Golden River** is one of the longest in [[Tian Xia]] and forms the border between [[Quain]] and [[Lingshen]] for most of its run. It begins high in the [[Wall of Heaven]] mountains of western Quain and flows in a northeasterly direction, eventually turning eastward near the [[House of 1000 Silks]]. It then turns southeastward and flows past the cities of [[Khitai]] and [[Nanzhu]] before emptying into a lake whose name is unknown.


## Myths

> The river is said to be the perspiration of the [[Celestial Dragon]] who turns to [[Gold|gold]] at dawn and sunset.


## Trade

> The Golden River is the primary trade route of the nation of Quain.
