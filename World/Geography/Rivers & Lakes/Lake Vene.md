> **Lake Vene** is located on the [[Shark Island]] in the [[Shackles]]. It is said that a [[Froghemoth|froghemoth]] adapted to the tropics lives in the swampy western hills framing the lake. Lake Vene is supposed to be the location of several undiscovered treasures, including the hoard of [[Redburnt Hurdaz]], captain of the legendary pirate [[Ship|galleon]] *[[Thief of Paradise]]*. It is known that shortly before Hurdaz's mysterious disappearance, she had captured a fat [[Aspis Consortium]]'s convoy transporting a full year's tribute from a rich [[Garund|Garundi]] port.
