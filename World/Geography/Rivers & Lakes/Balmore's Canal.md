> **Balmore's Canal** is an artificial waterway that bisects the [[Tamuth District]] in the southwest corner of the [[Andoran|Andoren]] capital of [[Almas]]. Originally built to transport merchant barges, the canal has become a repulsive dumping ground for industrial waste from [[Smithtown]], and more organic waste from Muggett. The canal's appearance and stench have become an embarrassment for the city, but no one has come up with a satisfying solution for the problem.
