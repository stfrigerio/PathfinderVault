> The **River Sphinx** is the largest river in [[Osirion]], flowing north from its twin sources, the [[Crook River|Crook]] and the [[Asp River]], to the [[Inner Sea]]. The majority of the nation's population lives along its banks, relying on the river for drinking water, transit, and silt from seasonal flooding for agriculture. Papyrus reeds and white lotus blossoms grow from its waters, and [[Crocodile|hetkoshu]], a type of Osirian [[Crocodile|crocodile]], lurk in its depths. [[Hippopotamus|Hippopotami]] are occasionally found, but they have been hunted to near-extinction. [[Hydra|Hydras]] live in the river's delta, where they have long been a menace to local people.
> The goddess [[Wadjet]], the Green Empress, is the patron and embodiment of the River Sphinx and may live in the river's delta. Many temples to Wadjet may be found on the banks of the river.
