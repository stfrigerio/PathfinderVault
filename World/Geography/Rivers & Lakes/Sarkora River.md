> The **Sarkora River** was once the mercantile lifeline of the [[Kellid]] nation of [[Sarkoris]] in northeastern [[Avistan]]. When the [[Worldwound]] opened in [[4606 AR]], it quickly became a prime battleground in the ongoing war against the [[Demon|demons]] of the [[Abyss]]. The Sarkora today is still heavily traveled, but only by demons and their mortal servants.

## Geography

> The Sarkora has its origins in the countless springs of [[Frostmire Fen]], close to the border with the [[Wolfcrags]]. From there it flows in a generally southern direction through the region of [[Frostmire]] and past the city of [[Undarin]]. South of Undarin it is joined by the [[West Sarkora River]] near the [[Needleglens]], after which it turns southeasterly, passing the [[Forest of Embers]], Ghalcor's Tower, the city of [[Raliscrad]], and finally joins the [[West Sellen River]] at the ruins of [[Storasta]] near the borders of [[Mendev]].
