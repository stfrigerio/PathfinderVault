> **Zura's Mouth** is a series of springs and pools in the [[Kaava Lands]] and the source of the slow and broad [[Oubinga River]] which meanders through the jungles of the southwestern [[Mwangi Expanse]] before emptying into [[Desperation Bay]]. A number of tribes worship the place and use the pools for [[Ritual|ritual]] sacrifice by drowning. The bodies don't last long, as the Oubinga's upper reaches are home to crimson maka-yika, a schooling, carnivorous [[Fish|fish]] similar to piranhas.
