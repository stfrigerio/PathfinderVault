> **Misty Lake** is a small body of the water next to the [[Hellknights|Hellknight-dominated]] town of [[Fort Inevitable]] in the northwestern [[River Kingdoms]]. It is fed by a nearby spring and an unnamed stream that trickles down out of the [[Echo Wood]] from the northeast. Misty Lake is 50 feet deep in the middle, and some believe that a local lord sunk a treasure chest there over a century ago. Numerous attempt have been made to find the treasure, but so far none has been successful. The lake is bordered to the north and west by the fields of the Holworth Dairy and by [[Kettlefoot Mill]], to the east by the walls of the town, and to the south by Naldred's Farm.
