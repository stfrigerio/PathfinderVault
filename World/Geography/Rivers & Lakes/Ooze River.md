> The **Ooze River**, sometimes simply known as the **Ooze**, is a fetid river that runs through the middle of the [[Orc|orc]] city of [[Urglin]] in [[Varisia|Varisias]] [[Cinderlands]]. As Urglin lacks a sewer system, all of the city's waste and sewage is tossed directly into the Ooze, resulting in its apt, if unpleasant, moniker and pudding-like consistency. Most of Urglin's inhabitants gather their drinking water from the city's western wall, before it has a chance to become polluted. As the river flows east through Urglin, it becomes more sluggish and vile, eventually miring in [[Pusbubble Lake]] outside the city's eastern walls.
> Two bridges cross the Ooze within Urglin, one close to the eastern wall and Pusbubble Lake and the other near the district of [[Bonerattle]]. [[Oozefront]], Urglin's primary market district, stretches along the entire flow of the Ooze through the city.
