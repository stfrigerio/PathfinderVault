> ***The River Bird Catcher*** is a short story told among the people of the nation of [[Andoran]]. Taking place before the nation seceded from [[Taldor]], the story describes an encounter between an [[Avoral|avoral]] and [[Duke Lapist]], leader of a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] encampment.
> Lapist treats the avoral, disguised as a harmless [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird]] catcher, with cruelty. As a result, he is killed by [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/celestial|celestial]] [[Falcon|falcons]] when the [[Outsider|outsider]] reveals its true form. The story is seen as the origin of the freedoms held by the people of Andoran to this day.
