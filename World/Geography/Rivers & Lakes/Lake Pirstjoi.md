> **Lake Pirstjoi** is a massive, circular body of water in [[Iobaria|Iobarias]] [[Deeprun Crevasse]], formed by the [[Myrfrus River]] after it enters a broad plain in the Crevasse's southern reaches. The island known as [[Zvartjan]] by the local [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] rises above the otherwise placid lake, and spreads a thick fog over the lake during the day, while at night the lake echoes with frightening screams and howls.
