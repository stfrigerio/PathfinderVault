> The **Inkwater River** is a short river that flows through the nations of [[Molthune]] and [[Nirmathas]]. From its headwaters in the southern [[Mindspin Mountains]], it flows along the borders of the two lands, where it marks the western edge of the [[Plains of Molthune]]. From there, it turns north into Nirmathas where it joins with the greater [[Marideth River]] south of [[Fangwood]]. The water is heavily polluted from centuries of mining in the Mindspin Mountains.
