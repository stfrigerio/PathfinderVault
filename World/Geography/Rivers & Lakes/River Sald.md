> The **River Sald** is the only major river on the island nation of [[Jalmeray]]. It flows through the central part of the island from from the small hills in the east to the [[Obari Ocean]] in the west. The source of the river is a spring that is capped by a beautiful white and gold temple called the [[Pure Temple of the Maharajah]].
> The small fishing village of Mudaliar lies on the southern shore of the river within the [[Segang Jungle]]. Ferrymen here charge a [[Currency|silver piece]] each to carry people across the river on their barge, and charge 5 silver pieces to carry [[Elephant|elephants]].
