> The **Shuidao River** runs from its source in [[Po Li]] northeast through the Chang Liao Jungle and empties into [[Naikang Bay]]. It forms the highly-contested border between the nations of [[Bachuan]] and [[Hwanggot]], and Bachuan's capital of [[Peijia]] is built at its delta. Numerous stone fortresses have been erected on the Hwanggot side of the river in anticipation of conflict.
