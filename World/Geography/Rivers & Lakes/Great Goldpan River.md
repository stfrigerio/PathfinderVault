> The **Great Goldpan River** begins just south of the capital city of [[Highhelm Militia]] in the [[Five Kings Mountains]]. From there it flows westward onto the plains of [[Druma]] and enters the [[Palakar Forest]], where it meets the [[Profit's Flow|Profits Flow]] at the town of [[Macridi]]. Downstream of this confluence, the river carries the name of the Profit's Flow as it flows northward toward [[Lake Encarthan]]. The Great Goldpan gets its name from the large amounts of [[Gold|gold]] dust that can be found in it. It also carries a fair amount of trade to and from the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] city of Highhelm.
