> Running along much of [[Mendev|Mendevs]] southern border with [[Numeria]], the **Egelsee River** is an important geographical feature for Mendev.


## Bounty of the river

> The river provides the capital city of [[Nerosyan]] with all of its fresh water, and the abundant fisheries found along the Egelsee's length help keep Nerosyan's population fed. Despite this, the most important feature of the river is a unique mineral that collects in its silt called Nexavar. This mineral counteracts the corrupting influence of the [[Worldwound]], meaning that the southern length of the [[Sellen River]] is not corrupted by [[Demon|demonic]] influence and that no aquatic [[Demon|demons]] can swim down its length to the lands it touches, or even worse, the [[Inner Sea]]. If it was not for the Egelsee River, who knows how far the demonic taint could have spread. Nexavar is so effective at stopping corruption that it was used in the creation of the [[Wardstone|Wardstones]] that help keep the expanding Worldwound in check.


## History

> Numerian raids across the Egelsee used to be quite common, but the increasing presence of [[Mendevian Crusades|crusaders]] in Mendev has deterred these attacks in the past few decades.
