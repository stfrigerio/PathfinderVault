> **Cougar Creek** is a small creek south of [[Sandpoint]] that runs from the [[Ashen Rise]], near [[Habe's Sanatorium|Habes Sanatorium]], to the [[Varisian Gulf]]. In [[4707 AR]] three known con men ([[Tarch Mortwell]], [[Lener Hask]], and [[Gedwin Tabe]]) were murdered in an abandoned barn along the creek.  The murder was witnessed by [[Grayst Sevilla]], who was driven insane by the experience. The creek is named for the [[Mountain lion|mountain lions]] that are spotted annually cooling off in the water of the stream.


## Dangers

> - An abnormal number of mountain lions are reported being seen around the creek each year compared to the surrounding area.
> - Some [[Haniver|haniver]] have made the mouth of the creek their home, bothering and stealing from any townsfolk who try to fish there.
