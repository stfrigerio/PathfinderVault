> The source of the **Kansorro River** is in the north-western part of the county of [[Varno]] in [[Ustalav]]. From there, the river runs, initially, in a south-easterly manner before it veers to a southerly flow. The river meets a tributary, [[Crosscreek]], some 65 miles from its source, just over ten miles east of the town of [[Redleaf]]. From there, the combined river enters the north-eastern corner of the [[Forest of Veils]], now running in a south-westerly direction. After another twenty miles, the Kansorro River flows into the [[Nicklecross River]]; this occurs south of Redleaf at the border of Varno with [[Versex]] county, within the Forest of Veils.
