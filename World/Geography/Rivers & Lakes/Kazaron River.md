> The **Kazaron River** flows from its numerous sources high in the [[Kodar Mountains]] of northeastern [[Varisia]] in a southwesterly direction into the [[Storval Plateau]], forming the northern boundary of the [[Cinderlands]]. It provides this harsh land with much-needed moisture and nutrients, leading to much richer plant life. From there it turns south, passing through rugged hills and grassland before it empties into the [[Storval Deep]]. In addition to forming the northern border of the Cinderlands, the Kazaron also marks the edges of the territory traveled by both the [[ShoantiTribes of the Shoanti|Lyrune-Quah]] and [[ShoantiTribes of the Shoanti|Sklar-Quah]] tribes of the [[Shoanti]]. The river is also the first way marker on the way to the fabled city of [[Xin-Shalast]].
