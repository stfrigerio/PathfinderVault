> The **Ravensfoot River** is located in the [[Chenogg Rainforest]], a vast untamed and deadly rainforest that dominates the northern part of the [[Motaku Isle]] in the [[Shackles]]. At least seven mysterious vine-choked obelisks line the river. Some scholars believe that these monuments may be the reason why not a single [[Ghol-Gan]] ruin has been found on Motaku Isle.
