> **Lake Stormunder** is a freshwater lake located in north-western [[Varisia]], close to the border with the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. It is fed by numerous rivers and streams from the [[Kodar Mountains]], as well as plentiful underwater geysers which cause its surface to roil and churn, giving the lake its name. [[Roc|Rocs]] are a danger to anyone idling by the shore of the lake as they regularly hunt for prey over the waters of the lake. The [[Steam River]] flows out of the lake, eventually emptying into the [[Steaming Sea]].  On the lake's eastern shore lies the [[Rimeskull|Rimeskull mountain]], so named because of a roughly skull-shaped outcropping near its peak.  At the foot of the mountain is an almost perfectly preserved [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] ruin called the Sihedron Circle, which has only been recently revealed to be a magical portal to a location known as the [[Runeforge]].
