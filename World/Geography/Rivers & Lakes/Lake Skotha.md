> Located on [[Varisia]]'s [[Storval Plateau]], **Lake Skotha** is a freshwater lake fed from numerous springs in the [[Gnashers]]. It is considered holy by the [[Hill giant|hill giants]] of the Plateau, who come to bury their dead there. They place the bodies on rafts which they light on fire and send out onto the waters, believing that this guarantees that the [[Soul|souls]] of their brethren will join their ancestors.  On an island in the middle of the lake is [[Chorak's Tomb|Choraks Tomb]] a community considered semi-mythical to the [[Giant|giants]], and one that is generally avoided by everyone.
