> The **Rimeflow River** flows west out of the [[Glacier Lake]] at the centre of the witch realm of [[Irrisen]]. It passes the city of [[Algidheart]] on its way to the border with the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. At the border it is fed by its tributary called the [[Iceflow]].



## Geography

> Within the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the river continues its generally western flow passing first watchful [[Blackraven Hall]], then the city of [[Trollheim]]. After Trollheim, it is joined by its second main tributary, the [[Thundering River]]. The Rimeflow then meanders through the country until, at its estuary, the river passes on its southern banks the *de facto* capital of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings: [[Kalsgard]], with its vast [[Kalsgard Shipyards|shipyards]]. Here the tributary [[Rannveig's Run|Rannveigs Run]] joins the flow of the Rimeflow from within the city. While Kalsgard passes on the southern bank, the [[Gnome|gnome]] settlement of [[Iceferry]] passes on its northern banks. Beyond Kalsgard, the Rimeflow flows out into the [[Steaming Sea]].


## Source of food

> In the Thanelands, the Rimeflow is the source of great fertility in the lands immediately neighbouring it and to the south. The river also provides great quantities of fish, though fishing can be hard due to the fearsome fish in the river, such as giant gars and carnivorous trout.


## History

> The Rimeflow was the historic southern border of the first [[Linnorm King|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Saebjorn Arm-Fang]]. He attempted to expand his domain to the south of the river, but never succeeded, and eventually disappeared while traveling to confront the great [[Linnorm|linnorm]] [[Fafnheir]].
