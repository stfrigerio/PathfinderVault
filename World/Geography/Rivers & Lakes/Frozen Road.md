> The **Frozen Road** is a frigid, slow-moving river that arises from the [[Tusk Mountains]] in the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], continues west through [[Irrisen]] for 200 miles and then turns south and pours into [[Glacier Lake]]. It acts as a 200 miles long border between the Irriseni provinces of [[Feyfrost]] in the north and [[Thronehold]] in the south. Its last 50 miles long segment forms the border between the provinces of [[Bleakmarch]] in the west and the Thronehold in the east. Floes of ice move westward downstream all year, often blocking river traffic for miles. A large number of ice cleaving teams out of the town of [[Trezira]] patrol the river in 3-month tours along all its length breaking up the ice blocks. Frozen Road is populated by numerous fish, though more dangerous creatures live in or along the waterway, including many wild [[Fey|feys]] unwilling to live in [[Chillblight]].
