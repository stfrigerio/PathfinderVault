> The **Bluehook River** on the [[Tempest Cay]] island in the [[Shackles]], is a lazy river that bisects the thick nigh-impenetrable rainforest of the island. The soil in the region is fertile but the constant rains make it difficult to grow any food crops, and the jungle is home to various predatory [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]], carnivorous [[Ape|apes]], venomous reptiles, and small [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaurs]] like [[Compsognathus|compsognathus]]. A [[Catoblepas|catoblepas]] that goes by the name of [[Gruzugr]] has recently made its home in the river, and its noxious breath has [[Poison|poisoned]] much of Bluehook. The poisoned waters cause a significant problem to settlements like [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Downpour]] that live from the [[Fish|fish]] of the river.
