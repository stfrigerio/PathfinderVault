> **Libera River** is the major river of the [[Bag Island]] in the [[Shackles]]. The river is lazy and shaded in most of its journey, feeding several hot marshy areas which are home to venomous [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]], oversized insects, and giant amphibians. It is said that [[Manticore|manticores]] and even a [[Black dragon|black dragon]] have their lairs in the marshes.
