> The **Bearleg Lakes** are an area of moorland dotted with lakes and rivers southwest of the Gaarjuk Hills, in the [[Crown of the World]].


## Inhabitants

> A number of [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] settlements exist throughout the area of the Bearleg Lakes, although they are not as common as in the more densely populated areas to the west, and consist chiefly of scattered villages and lodges. Bands of [[Bugbear|bugbears]] also live in the area.
> The Bearleg Lakes receive a yearly influx of spawning salmon and of thousands of migrating [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]] that nest in the cliffs of the Gaarjuk Hills. These in turn attract a great diversity of predators that come to take advantage of the high concentrations of prey available during this period.
> The Bearleg Lakes region is home primarily to common [[Animal|animals]] such as [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Eagle|eagles]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fox|foxes]], martens, and the [[Bear|bears]] that give the area its name. Rarer and more dangerous creatures are also found here, including [[Dire bear|dire bears]], [[Frost drake|frost drakes]], and [[Forest drake|forest drakes]]. A great variety of [[Fish|fish]] also lives here, including giant pikes.
