> The **Deluge River** is a narrow river which flows on the [[Isle of Kortos]] from its source in the foothills of the [[Kortos Mounts]], through the [[Immenwood]] in an easterly direction before turning east-south-east at the settlement of [[Meravon]]. It meets the [[Inner Sea]] at the north end of the town of [[Diobel]] which is on the south-western coast of the island. In Diobel, the Deluge is crossed by the Red Bridge which is home of a popular, high-class, pearl market called the [[Red Bridge Pearl Market]].
