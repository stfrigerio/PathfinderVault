> The **Arthfell River** is a large stream that flows through the [[Andoran|Andoren]] coastal city of [[Augustana]], roughly dividing it into a northern and southern half. Its delta is divided into an outer harbor (also known as the "salt harbor") and an inner harbor further upstream (known as the "fresh harbor"). The salt harbor is bordered by numerous industrial neighborhoods, including both military and civilian shipyards and dry docks, while the fresh harbor is accessible only by small fishing vessels and river traffic.
