> The **Skull River** is a small river which connects the lake known as the [[Storval Deep]] to the [[Yondabakari River]] in central [[Varisia]]. It must first pass through [[Skull's Crossing|Skulls Crossing]], an ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] dam, and then flows down through the eastern edge of the [[Wyvern Mountains]] before it reaches [[Claybottom Lake]] at the town of [[Turtleback Ferry]]. On the far side of the lake it continues to flow southward past the [[Ashwood]] until it empties into [[Lake Syrantula]] near the town of [[Ilsurian]]. Its entire length is approximately 80 miles.
> Ferry service exists along the Skull between the towns of Ilsurian and Turtleback Ferry.
