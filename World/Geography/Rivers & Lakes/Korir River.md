> The **Korir River** is formed by the confluence of the Upper Korir River, the Tpishi River and the Lakusa River west of the [[Shattered Range]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. The ruins of [[Rastel city|Rastel]] and [[Liclac]] stand on its banks.
> The river flows through the [[Screaming Jungle]], joins the [[Pasuango River]], and empties into the [[Lake of Vanished Armies]]. The [[River of Lost Tears]] also flows into the lake. From there the Lower Korir River forms the Korir River Delta and flows into the sea at [[Desperation Bay]].
> The river has a number of waterfalls and rapids, which has the benefit of reducing the numbers of [[Crocodile|crocodiles]] and [[Hippopotamus|hippopotamuses]]. However, the river is home to dangerous [[Giant gar|giant gar]], and there is the added threat of large [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]] which drop on prey from branches hanging over the river.
> The river serves as a trade route between [[Port Freedom]] and [[Kalabuto]] in [[Sargava]]. It also links them to [[Mzali]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]], but foreign traders are unwelcome there.
> Port Freedom stands on the northern bank of the delta. The pilots of the [[Rivermen's Guild|Rivermens Guild]] of Port Freedom know the route through the treacherous sand bars of the delta. It is rare to find a captain brave or foolish enough to attempt the delta without a Guild pilot.
