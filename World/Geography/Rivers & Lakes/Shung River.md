> The **Shung River** runs through the Dragon Empire of [[Xa Hoi]] and is one of two rivers, along with the [[Ban Chuy River]], that meets at the nation's capital of [[Ngon Hoa]]. The river's source lies near the [[Kullan Dei|Kullan Dei Mountains]], it then flows through the western reaches of Xa Hoi before flowing north and meeting with the Ban Chuy River at Ngon Hoa. Eventually, after meandering north, its waters empty in [[Naikang Bay]] and the [[Okaiyo Ocean]] beyond.
