> The **River Bdonge** is a major tributary of the [[Vanji River]] and flows through much of the northeastern [[Mwangi Jungle]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. It begins in the hills of the [[Ndele Gap]] and flows westward into the Mwangi Jungle, soon passing the abandoned city of [[Nagisa]]. It continues its course and joins the Vanji at an unnamed lake after passing south of the [[Fountain of Tabis]].


## Inhabitants

> Countless creatures make their home along the Bdonge, the best known being the [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] who construct whole villages out vines.
