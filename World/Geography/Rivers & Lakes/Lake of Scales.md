> The **Lake of Scales** is located on the [[Shark Island]] in the [[Shackles]]. The Shark island interior is known for its wide variety of dangerous wildlife. The lake hosts herds of [[Ankylosaurus|ankylosaurus]], [[Iguanodon|iguanodons]], and [[Stegosaurus|stegosaurus]]. The wide and deep [[Greenscale River]] is fed by the Lake of Scales. Small [[Ship|sloops]] navigate the river from lake to sea. The islet in the center of the lake is littered with ivy-smothered [[Ghol-Gan]] ruins, burial sites of Ghol-Gan priests of dreadful long forgotten gods. Several parties have been lost trying to explore these hidden tombs.
