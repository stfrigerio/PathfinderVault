> The **Sphinx Delta** stretches from a few miles north of [[Sothis]] all the way to the [[Inner Sea]]. The [[River Sphinx]] breaks into many sluggish, shallow weed-choked channels and surrounds marshy islands and sandbars. The channels shift with the seasons, but there is almost always one main channel that is used by deep-draft [[Ship|ships]]; otherwise, a channel has to be dredged. 
> The main channels are well patrolled and charted, but the backwaters are not worth the effort. The swamps are home to ferocious beasts like [[Hydra|hydras]] and [[Basilisk|basilisks]]. Tribes of isolationist [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] live in the delta as well. The uncharted waterways of the delta are used by cults of [[Erastil]], [[Gogunta]], and [[Hanspur]].
