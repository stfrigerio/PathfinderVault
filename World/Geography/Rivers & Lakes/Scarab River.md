> The **Scarab River** in western [[Osirion]], marking the border between the [[Footprints of Rovagug]] and the [[Glazen Sheet|Glazen Sheets]] of the [[Osirian Desert]], flows westwards until it merges with the [[Junira]]. The [[Ruins of El-Amara]] lie close to where the two rivers meet.
> The river's source is a group of springs located high among hills close to the [[Parched Dunes]]. It provides sustenance to [[Beetle|beetles]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]] with razor-sharp feathers, the [[Stymphalides|stymphalides]]; the latter are watched over at their headwaters by an elderly [[Witch|witch]], [[Haptaba the Ibis-Headed]].
> The river, unlike others in Osirion, does not have seasonal floods.
