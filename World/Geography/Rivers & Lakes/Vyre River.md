> The **Vyre River** runs across [[Vyre Island]] before bisecting the city of [[Vyre]] and finally emptying into [[Keelwrack Harbor]]. The Vyre River runs roughly west to east dividing Vyre in two, splitting it between north and south. The river, going west to east, separates [[Westwatch]] and [[Duskwalk]] before cutting through the middle of the [[River District Vyre|River District]] and, finally, dividing [[Nightcrown]] from [[Southmarket]].
