> **Biston's Pond** is located southeast of [[Sandpoint]] where [[Weasel Creek]] and the [[Turandarok River]] meet. Named after a [[Varisian]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] whose run-down shack still sits on the western shore, rumors abound that the druid's ghost haunts the area. [[Goblin|Goblins]] from the [[Mosswood]] forest routinely fish along the eastern shore. The Biston Pond Mill is one of several flour mills in the Sandpoint area that burned down mysteriously.
