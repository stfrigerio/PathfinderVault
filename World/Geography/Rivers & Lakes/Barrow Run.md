> The **Barrow Run** river rises in the [[Hungry Mountains]] in the heart of [[Virlych]] county in south-eastern [[Ustalav]]. It runs in an easterly direction for over twenty miles before turning northwards to become the border between the counties of Virlych and [[Amaans]]. After some fifteen miles the Barrow Run, along with the county border, turns to a north-easterly direction, eventually joining the [[Orphield River]] as a tributary. For its last fifteen miles, the Barrow Run becomes the county border between Amaans and [[Canterwall]]. In total, the river is about sixty miles long.
> The Barrow Run, along with the [[Mesmos River]], form a boundary between different weather patterns in the Hungry Mountains and Virlych: to the west of these two rivers, angry, purple clouds adorn the mountain peaks in some way controlled by the malevolent spirit of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]]; to the east, violent storms wrack the mountains.
