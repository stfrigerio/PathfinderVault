> The **Brookwall** is the only major river that rises and flows fully within the county of [[Odranto]] in [[Ustalav]]. It has its source in the plains in the east of Odranto near the border with county [[Barstoi]]. The Brookwall flows for about forty miles in a west-north-westerly direction and is swelled by the waters from the lake called the [[Baileywell]] just past its half way point. It is a tributary of the important [[Vhatsuntide River]], which it meets at the northern edges of the [[Foxfall]] woods and on the western border of Odranto with its neighbouring [[Lozeri]] county.
