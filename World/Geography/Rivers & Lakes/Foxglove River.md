> The **Foxglove River** is south of [[Sandpoint]], running through the [[Whisperwood]] to the [[Varisian Gulf]]. The [[Lost Coast Road]] crosses the river via a covered bridge. A path runs alongside the river to the west of the bridge, leading to [[Foxglove Manor]]. In [[4707 AR]] some sages noted increased [[Ghoul|ghoul]] activity along its banks.
