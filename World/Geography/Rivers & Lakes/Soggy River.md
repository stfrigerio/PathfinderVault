> The **Soggy River** is a small stream which flows through the hinterlands south of the village of [[Sandpoint]] along [[Varisia]]'s [[Lost Coast]]. It passes the [[Whisperwood Varisia|Whisperwood]], twists its way through fertile farmlands, and crosses the [[Lost Coast Road]] before emptying into [[Sog's Bay|Sogs Bay]]. Its delta forms the wetlands known as [[Brinestump Marsh]]. A grain mill was once located along its banks, serving the local wheat and corn farmers. Sadly, it was destroyed by a fire around [[4706 AR]], an event blamed on the Scarnetti family of Sandpoint. Many of the farmers south of the Soggy River were murdered that same year by [[Ghoul|ghouls]] sent by the undead [[Aldern Foxglove]]. The area is also the occasional hunting ground of a [[Sea hag|sea hag]] named [[Peg o' Ness|Peg o Ness]] who lives in a sea cave off of the nearby peninsula known as [[Hag's Plummet|Hags Plummet]].
