> The **Black Flow**, or **Black Flow River**, is the northernmost of the four major rivers that flow through the [[Sodden Lands]]. It rises in the north, flows southwards, and then winds westwards into the [[Arcadian Ocean]] close to the edge of the [[Eye of Abendego]].
> The flooded ruins of [[Oagon]], one of the cities of the destroyed nation of [[Lirgen]], stand at the river's mouth.
