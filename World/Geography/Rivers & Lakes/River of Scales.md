> The **River of Scales** runs for a distance of sixty miles in a generally western flow across north-eastern [[Ustalav]]. Its progresses as follows:

> - it rises in pretty much the middle of county [[Barstoi]];
> - after a few miles the river is significant enough to act as the boundary between the counties of Barstoi and [[Ardeal]];
> - it then passes the point where the three counties of Ardeal, Barstoi and [[Odranto]] meet: their [[httpenwikipediaorgtripoint|tripoint]]
> - and then marks the border between Ardeal and Barstoi;
> - the River of Scales then flows past the bountiful, Ardealian settlement of [[Berus]] on its southern bank;
> - flow then turns southwards to meet its tributary, the [[Carew River]];
> - the river then arcs around in a 'U' shape ending up flowing north-westwards when it meets the major [[Vhatsuntide River]], where the River of Scales becomes one of that vast river's many tributaries.
