> The **Gullik River** springs from a northern branch of the [[Kodar Mountains]] and meanders northwest through the [[Algid Wastes]] for 100 miles before it is fed by its [[Red Fox River]] tributary. Less than 50 miles beyond that it is joined by the Wayward River, which flows from the [[Tusk Mountains]] to the east. Then it continues north for the last 150 miles of its course, acting as the border between [[Irrisen]] and the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], before it flows into the [[Frozen Road River]]. [[Kellid]] tribes often clash with Irriseni raiders in this bloody, lonely area, while packs of [[Troll|trolls]] and [[Ice troll|ice trolls]] pick off members of both groups, and their long-dead [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]]  haunt the battlefields. Some of the trolls are in the employ of Irrisen's [[White Witches]], and act as a regenerating first defense of the realm.
