> The **Coldforge** is a tiny stream that flows off the northern slope of [[Droskar's Crag|Droskars Crag]] in the [[Darkmoon Vale]] region of [[Andoran]]. It springs specifically from the Coldforge glacier, one of the many glaciers that cover the Crag, and runs for fewer than 10 miles before dispersing into the Kingtower Woods.
