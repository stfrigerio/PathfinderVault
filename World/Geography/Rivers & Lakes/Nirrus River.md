> The **Nirrus River**, or the **Cliff-flow**, rises from numerous springs and small lakes in the [[Icerime Peaks]] and their foothills. Flowing over cliffs, these streams eventually merge into the five major tributaries to the Nirrus, merging shortly before the river empties into the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]]. The river is rich in fish and precious metals, and more [[Human|human]] settlements can be found clustered along its length than anywhere else in [[Okor's Basin|Okors Basin]] south of Sorith Wood.
