> The **Dhavala River** is viewed by many [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]] as the cradle where the early nation of [[Vudra]] grew, sheltered by the river goddess [[Dhavala]]. The Dhavala is still revered as a holy river and the region of [[The Cradle]] is named after its nurturing role to this day. The Dhavala River was once surrounded by a vast forest but millennia of civilisation has seen the forest mostly cut down and dwindle to a few scattered pockets of greenery. The [[Vudrani-Dhavala]] people who make up much of Vudra's population take their name from the river.
