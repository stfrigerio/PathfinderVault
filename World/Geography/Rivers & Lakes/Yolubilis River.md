> The **Yolubilis River** is a major waterway of northern [[Cheliax]] and is [[Ravounel]]'s largest river. Most of the region's smaller settlements sit upon its shores.
> From its headwaters near [[Mount Spire]] in the [[Menador Mountains]], it flows around [[Ravounel Forest]] and across the [[North Plains]] before reaching [[Nisroch Bay]] at the city of [[Kintargo]].
> The banks of the river are known to be the home of gigantic heron-like creatures known as the [[Yolubilis heron]].
