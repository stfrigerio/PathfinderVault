> The **Ardshrod River**, also known as the **Icy Way**, flows across the northern tundra of [[Iobaria]], dividing the sparsely settled southern territories from the savage and barren north. Running west to east, the Ardshrod empties the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]] and flows through [[Nyvyrd|the Nyvyrd]] before meeting the [[Myrfrus River]] in the [[Deeprun Crevasse]] near the [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaur]] settlement of [[Vurnirn]].
> Choked with ice for much of the year, few dare travel on the Ardshrod despite the river serving as an artery between the [[Castrovin Sea]] and [[Avistan|Northern Avistan]].
