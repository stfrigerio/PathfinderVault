> **Silver Tarn** is a lake located high up in the [[Brazen Peaks]] of [[Katapesh]], named both for its highly reflective, still mountain waters and for the abandoned [[Silver|silver]] mines that surround it.
> These old mines look [[Dwarf|dwarven]] in origin, and some suspect it may have been mined by the dwarves of [[Halls of Hammerfall|Hammerfall]]. Others surmise that the caverns may not have been mined dry, but rather that the dwarves hit upon a tunnel leading to the [[Darklands]] and abandoned their pursuits as a result. Some claim that they have seen short shadowy figures emerging from the tunnels around the lake's edge and few prospectors venture to this dangerous location.
