> The **Orphield River** rises in the north-western peaks of the [[Hungry Mountains]] in the county of [[Virlych]], in south-eastern [[Ustalav]], very close to the terror-inducing [[Gallowspire]] in the ruins of [[Adorak]]. It runs in an easterly direction for over fifty miles to the border of Virlych with its neighbouring county of [[Canterwall]]. The river then runs through Canterwall for over ten miles to its confluence with its tributary, the [[Barrow Run]], which has also descended from the Hungry Mountains of Virlych. During its progression through Canterwall, the river passes the settlement of [[Marian Leigh]]. Where it meets the Barrow Run, the Orphield veers to a north-easterly flow and begins to act as the border between the two counties of Canterwall and [[Amaans]]. It maintains its border role for some forty miles, often with the [[Eshirwood]] on its north-western bank, before it reaches its confluence with the [[Vhatsuntide River]] to the west of the city of [[Ardis]]. In total, the river is over 110 miles long.
