> The **East Sellen River** flows south out of the [[Icerime Peaks]] of [[Brevoy]] through the [[Gronzi Forest]], and empties into [[Lake Reykal]]. The river continues south past [[New Stetven]] into the [[River Kingdoms]], passing through the lands of [[House Medvyed]], [[House Lebeda]], and [[House Rogarvia]]. In the River Kingdoms it flows through [[Lake Hooktongue]], passing the city of [[Mivon]] before being joined by the Chalkstone River west of [[Liberthane]]. From there it flows south into [[Galt]] and turns west near the city of [[Isarn]], flowing through the [[Southern Hymbrian Forest]], where it is joined by the Hymbrian River. It finally flows into [[Kallas Lake]] where it joins the [[Sellen River]].
