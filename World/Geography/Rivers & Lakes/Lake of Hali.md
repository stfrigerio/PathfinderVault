> The **Lake of Hali** (or **Lake Hali**, or simply **Hali**) is a monstrous body of water that laps at the shore of [[Carcosa]], the monstrous, alien city on a distant [[Planet|planet]] where the [[Great Old One]] [[Hastur]] dwells. The water in the lake tastes and smells mildly foul, and no [[Fish|fish]] swims in it. At sunset, Carcosa's twin [[Star|suns]] seem to sink into Lake Hali, and a dense, horrific mist starts rolling above the surface until dawn.
