> The **Marching Springs** are a 30 square mile region of [[Nirmathas]] between the [[Fangwood]] and the [[Mindspin Mountains]]. Geysers erupt in a procession through the region.


## Inhabitants

> Scholars believe there is a hidden portal to the [[Plane of Water]] underneath the region due to the high number of [[Water elemental|water elementals]] found in the area. Indeed, further evidence is provided in that sometimes families living near the springs give birth to [[Undine|undine]] and a small population of these [[Geniekin|geniekin]] now prosper in the region.
> [[Ooze|Oozes]] are also common in the area.
