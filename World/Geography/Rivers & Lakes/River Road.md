> The **River Road** is the name given to the water route on the [[Sellen River]] between the [[Inner Sea]] and the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]] in northern [[Avistan]]. It is generally associated with the [[Mendevian Crusades]], as it is the route that crusaders and pilgrims take on their way to the nation of [[Mendev]] and from there to battle the [[Demon|demons]] of the [[Worldwound]].


## Geography

> As most travel it only south to north (since many fail to return), the River Road is generally thought to begin at the city of [[Cassomir]] in [[Taldor]]. From there one travels up the Sellen River and into the [[Verduran Forest]] past the [[Isle of Arenway]] and the town of [[Bellis]]. The River Road crosses into strife-plagued [[Galt]] near the city of [[Woodsedge]], and continues north on the eastern border of the [[Elf|elven]] nation of [[Kyonin]] to [[Kallas Lake]]. Once past the lake, the Sellen continues north into the [[River Kingdoms]], passing the towns of [[Novoboro]], the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druidic]] enclave of [[Sevenarches]], and the cities of [[Artume city|Artume]] and strange [[Outsea]]. North of the River Kingdoms, the River Road passes into the [[Kellid]] nation of [[Numeria]]. Most travelers stop at the trade town of [[Hajoth Hakados]] (which is actually located on the [[Seven Tears River]]) as it is the first major settlement after many miles of travelling through the wilderness. Returning to the Sellen, the River Road continues past the town of [[Mormouth]] (located in the River Kingdom of [[Pitax]]) and then north through the eastern plains of Numeria before finally emptying into the Lake of Mists and Veils at the city of [[Chesed]]. From there most crusaders cross the Lake to the Mendevian town of [[Egede]] and from there overland past the [[Estrovian Forest]] to the capital city of [[Nerosyan]].


## The Crusader Road

> The **Crusader Road** is an offshoot of the River Road, and is an alternate way for crusaders and pilgrims to travel to Mendev. It follows the Sellen River from Cassomir to Kallas Lake, but splits there from the River Road, travelling up the [[West Sellen River]] north of Kyonin and continuing on that waterway past the nation of [[Razmiran]] and the River Kingdoms settlements of [[Tymon]], [[Maashinelle]], [[Thornkeep]], and [[Lockridge]]. The Crusader Road in the River Kingdoms is heavily patrolled by bandits, confidence men, and others who wish to separate the naive or unprepared from their wealth. West of the [[Echo Wood]] it serves as the border between Numeria and [[Ustalav]], passing the towns of [[Vische]], [[Dravod Knock]], and [[Aaramor]] and ends at Nerosyan. The Crusader Road was the primary route for reaching Mendev during the [[First Mendevian Crusade|First]] and [[Second Mendevian Crusade|Second Mendevian Crusades]]. After the [[Sarkoris|Sarkorian]] town of [[Storasta]] (that sits on the West Sellen) fell during the Second Crusade, the route became too dangerous, and the crusaders instead chose the longer path up the Sellen proper through the Numerian city of Chesed.
