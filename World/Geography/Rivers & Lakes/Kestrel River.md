> The **Kestrel River** is a tributary of the [[Path River]] that begins in the eastern [[Mindspin Mountains]] of the [[Hold of Belkzen]], north of the town of [[Trunau]]. It flows in an east-northeasterly direction along the former border of the [[Hordeline]] before passing over the border into [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]]. In that nation, the river turns northeast near [[Castle Everstand]] before joining the [[River Esk]] and forming the Path River near [[Castle Firrine]]. Eventually, the waters of the Path empty into [[Lake Encarthan]].
