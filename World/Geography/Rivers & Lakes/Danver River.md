> The **Danver River** rises in the [[Hungry Mountains]] and flows almost due south to its estuary where it enters [[Avalon Bay]] at [[Thrushmoor]], the county seat of [[Versex]] in the country of [[Ustalav]]. In its course it runs past the mining community of [[Hyannis]], in the west of [[Versex]], then runs to the west of [[Rozenport]]. The river forms the border between the counties of Versex and [[Caliphas]] for its entire length.
