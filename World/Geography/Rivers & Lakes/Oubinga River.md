The Oubinga River, at center.
> 
The **Oubinga River** has its source at [[Zura's Mouth|Zuras Mouth]], a series of pools and springs deep within the jungles of the [[Kaava Lands]]. It is fed by numerous sketchily-mapped tributaries, and enters the sea at the north-west edge of [[Desperation Bay]]. Zura's Mouth is a holy site where local tribes carry out ritual sacrifice by drowning. The bodies, and anything else rash enough to enter the river here, are eaten by schools of carnivorous fish. The regular food supply and downstream cataracts keep most of the deadly fish in the Zura's Mouth areaâ€”but not all of them.
