> **Lake Nirthran** (also known as the **Dying Sea**) is the largest known body of water in the [[Darklands]] level of [[Sekamina]]. Much of it is situated beneath the [[Inner Sea]] and is fed by the [[Braid]]. In the same way that the Inner Sea divides [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]], Lake Nirthran divides the [[Drow|drow]] empire to the north from the [[Ghoul|ghoul]] lands to the south.



## Geography

> The lake bed drops sharply from the shore, quickly reaching several hundred feet in depth within a few miles. The centre of the lake is much shallower due to a gravitational anomaly in [[Golarion|Golarions]] orbit and the erratic orbits of the [[Planet|planets]] [[Akiton]] and [[Castrovel]]. The floor of the lake bulges up here and the water averages only fifty feet in depth. There are also several islands in the central section.
> The eastern region of the lake forms an immense crescent around where the [[Isle of Kortos]] is found on the surface. Water rains down here from the Inner Sea, where a current takes it westward. At its western edge, the water churns violently as it flows through numerous weaknesses in the rock into the [[Sightless Sea]] in [[Orv]] below.
> The lake is fed by Darklands trickles, streams, and rivers from all over this region of [[Sekamina]] and [[Nar-Voth]]. The most well-known of these streams is the [[Tenebros River]], which has its origins in the countless caverns below the [[Candlestone Caves]] in northern [[Andoran]].


### Settlements

> The drow maintain two ports on the northern shores of Lake Nirthran: [[Telderist]] and [[Delvingulf]]. On the lake floor between them (and slightly farther south), lies the [[Skum|skum]] settlement of [[Cold Momugado]], while hundreds of miles to the southeast is the mysterious skum enclave of [[Ulat-Kini]]. Although the ghoul city of [[Nemret Noktoria]] is not located directly on the Dying Sea, it is close enough to its southern border to have a major influence.


## Denizens

> The depths of the lake are home to numerous species of giant [[Fish|fish]], including luminous, primordial [[Shark|sharks]], the eyeless leviathans known as the [[Faceless whale|faceless whales]], and a colossal, [[Evil|evil]] [[Sea serpent|sea serpent]] known as the [[Mourning One]]. The central islands are inhabited by skum, and the strongest of their tribes live in the settlement of [[Cold Momugado]] where they worship a massive tentacled horror named [[Shumbauth]] who is said to live in the depths of the lake's western reaches.
> The caverns above the western edge are home to [[Drider|driders]], [[Roper|ropers]], and [[Morlock|morlocks]].
