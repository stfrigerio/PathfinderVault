> The frigid **Vyalldehun River** is about 160 miles long and rises in the Linnorm Kingdom of the [[Thanelands]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. It flows west for over fifty miles, at which point the river turns to the south-west and meanders the rest of its course as the border between the Thanelands and [[Icemark]]. Finally, it becomes a tributary of the [[Whitegold River]] south of the [[Moundlands]].
> The river is named after an ancient [[Linnorm|linnorm]] called [[Vyalldehun]] whose lair was at [[Ice Spire]] just south of the river in the Thanelands.
