 The Jeggare River as it passes Korvosa and flows into Conqueror's Bay.
> Named for [[Montlarion Jeggare]], the **Jeggare River** plays a vital role in southern [[Varisia]].  The river flows from the [[Mindspin Mountains]] into [[Conqueror's Bay|Conquerors Bay]], and at its mouth it is split by [[Endrin Isle]] and the city of [[Korvosa]]. Before the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] invasion of the land, the native [[Shoanti]] called the river *Mashkapikki*.  The headwaters of the river are known for their plentiful supply of salmon, with which the Korvosans fill both their stomachs and their pockets as one of the city's major exports. The river is also known to empty into the most prosperous clam field in Varisia: the [[Narrows of St Alika]].
