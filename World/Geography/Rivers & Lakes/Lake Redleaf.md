> **Lake Redleaf** is a small expanse of water in western [[Varno]], [[Ustalav]], around which the small settlement of [[Redleaf]] is located. The lake lies on the border with [[Versex]] county and in the northern stretches of the [[Forest of Veils]]; the proximity of the forest provides the famous fire-coloured waters of the lake each autumn. The [[Nicklecross River]] flows out from the western end of the lake.
