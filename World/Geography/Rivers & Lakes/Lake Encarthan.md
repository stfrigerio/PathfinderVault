> **Lake Encarthan** is one of the largest bodies of water in [[Avistan]] and was once one of its most highly traveled as well. This changed somewhat when [[Tar-Baphon]] escaped from his prison of [[Gallowspire]] in [[4719 AR]] and relocated to the [[Isle of Terror]] in the middle of Lake Encarthan.  The nations of [[Druma]], the [[Gravelands]], [[Kyonin]], [[Molthune]], [[Nirmathas]], [[Razmiran]], and [[Ustalav]] all share the lake's coastline, and the port cities of [[Caliphas]], [[Kerse]], [[Tamran]], and [[Thronestep]] each serve as their nation's capital, no doubt bolstered both economically and militarily by their strategic locations on Encarthan's banks.



## Trade

> Trade was once of paramount importance on Lake Encarthan, but has been significantly scaled back since Tar-Baphon relocated to the Isle of Terror. Since then, much of the trade has relocated to the [[Sellen River]], which handles most of the trade between northern and southern Avistan.


## Inhabitants

> The lake contains numerous creatures, including [[Merrow|merrows]], [[Scrag|scrags]], and [[Skum|skum]]. The latter are known to make items out of [[Fishgold|fishgold]], the unique red gold found in its depths.


## Military presence

> The strongest military force on the lake is probably the navy of Molthune, based in [[Eranmas]] and primarily concerned with blockading Tamran, the capital of its rival, Nirmathas. However, other Encarthan powers view the navy with suspicion and the Molthuni leaders are keen to deploy their naval force solely against Nirmathas to help allay these fears.


## Places of interest

> At the lake's center stands the mysterious Isle of Terror where [[Aroden]] mortally wounded the wizard-king [[Tar-Baphon]] in [[896 AR]], and where he retreated to after destroying the nation of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] and losing his attack on [[Absalom]] in [[4719 AR]].
