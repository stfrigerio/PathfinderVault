> The **Whitegold River** rises in the [[Iceworm Hills]] in the far north-west of [[Icemark]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. It meanders in a south-easterly direction until it reaches the confluence with its tributary, the [[Vyalldehun River]], on the Icemark-[[Thanelands]] border south of the [[Moundlands]]. Here the river turns sharply to the south-south-west for its last thirty miles, before flowing out into the [[Steaming Sea]]. Its full length is some 150 miles.
