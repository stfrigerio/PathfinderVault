> **Brookman's Well** is a small spring just north of the small town of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] in [[Andoran]], which supplies most of the town's fresh water, as the waters of the [[Foam River]] are full of sawdust. The well was dug by a resident, named [[Dreklas Brookman]], in [[4673 AR]]. Brookman had big plans for the town and was gaining support of the residents when he crossed old [[Thalsin Kreed]]. Brookman ended up having an "accident" and the [[Kreed family]] immediately took control of the well. Their thugs always guard it, and charge a hefty fee for its use.
