> The **Jaadja River** rises in the eastern slopes of the southern part of the [[Shattered Range]]. It is joined shortly afterwards by the [[Scar River]]. It flows through the [[Mwangi Expanse]] and forms the border between the [[Field of Maidens]] and the [[Fields of Jaadja]]. It empties into the [[Axanir River]] on the border to [[Geb's Rest]].
