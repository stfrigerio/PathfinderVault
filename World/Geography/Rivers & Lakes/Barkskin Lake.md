> The legendary **Barkskin Lake** is believed to exist somewhere within the [[Bandu Hills]]. At the correct time of year, the lake's minerals are reputed to combine to give magical properties to the water. It is said that drinking the water toughens the skin, for a few minutes, giving it a barklike appearance. Thus, it is much sought after by adventurers wishing to benefit from these protective properties.
> It may be possible to find the lake by following wood-skinned animals and birds â€“ but there are also more dangerous creatures wishing to drink from the magical water.
> Explorers first claimed to have found the lake in [[4259 AR]], but subsequent expeditions were unable to locate it.
