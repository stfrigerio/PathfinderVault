> The **River Scorpius** winds through the centre of the city of [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]] as it sole waterway. The river does not cut a direct line east to the [[Obari Ocean]], but instead winds its way through the city.
> It enters beneath the White Bridge via the Serpent Gate, then runs into the serene [[Golden Oasis Katapesh|Golden Oasis]]. From there the River Scorpius heads south, skirting the [[Inner City District of Katapesh|Inner City]] before cutting through the Twilight Gate district and exiting the city through the actual [[Twilight Gate]]. Finally, the river heads through The Sprawl district squatting outside the city walls before cutting east into the expanse of the Obari Ocean.
