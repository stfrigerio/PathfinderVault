> **Sabkha** is a shallow basin filled with gritty [[Salt|salt]]-laden sand. It is the primary source for the nagri salt farmers use to make [[Pesh|pesh]]. Farmers travel to Sabkha once a season to sift salt out of the dirt and carry sacks of it home. Merchants flock to Sabkha to collect nagri salt, which they then sell in the markets of [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]]. Once a month or so, heavy rains fill Sabkha's shallow basin with trapped rainwater. After several days, the water drains out through the rock, leaving new salt deposits on the surface.
