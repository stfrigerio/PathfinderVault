> The **Tuunma River** forms the border between the [[Successor States|Successor State]] of [[Lingshen]] and the northern desert region of [[Shaguang]]. It also serves as a border between Lingshen and the war-hungry [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]] nation of [[Kaoling]]. The easternmost reaches of the Tuunma, towards its headwaters, are bordered by stretches of endless sand dunes. It takes the average [[Junk|junk]] around 12 days to navigate from the river's headwaters to the Kaoling section of the river. On route, it goes through a region known as the Kogendu Basin; this area is treacherous as it is frequently used as an ambush spot by hostile [[Mutabi-qi]] raiders but is also a frequent camp spot for the more friendly Jhemulit. From the Kaoling border, it normally takes another nine days for a [[Ship|ship]] to reach the [[Sea of Eels]]; this section of the Tuunma River is noticeably rougher and more dangerous to navigate. This danger is only made worse by the tribes of [[Kijimuna|kijimuna]] that often dwell along its shores.
