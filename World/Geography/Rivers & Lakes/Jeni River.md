> The **Jeni River** is a small tributary of the [[Tomarsulk River]] in central [[Cheliax]]. It begins in the foothills of the southern [[Menador Mountains]] and flows west through the [[Fields of Chelam]] to soon join the [[Travek River]] to form the Tomarsulk. Near the headwaters of the Jeni, the honeycombed hills have become a haven for runaway [[Slavery|slaves]] who have resisted the Chelish government's strongest efforts to dislodge them. Even the famed archers of [[House Napaciza]] could not successfully track them down. The ex-slaves are said to be led by a Chelish noblewoman whose entire family was believed to have been eradicated by [[House Thrune]] during the country's  [[Chelish Civil War|civil war]].
