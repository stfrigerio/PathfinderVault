> **Lauchlein Lake** is one of the more remote lakes of [[Meratt|Meratt county]]. Lauchlein Lake is shallow and filled with aquatic [[Plant|plants]], small [[Fish|fish]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Frog|frogs]]; it is often covered in mist, and its more swamp-like nature means the locals avoid it. Lauchlein Lake used to play host to a [[Fey|fey]] court, but this was in the distant past, millennia ago when the [[Verduran Forest]] still covered the lands of modern-day Meratt county. Today, a small circle of standing stones still sits beside Lauchlein Lake, attesting to its ancient fey inhabitants.
> Lauchlein Lake has long been the subject of a variety of rumours; the stone circle, in particular, goes through decades-long cycles of being used for local weddings and events before then being shunned as a supposed site of foul [[Ritual|rituals]]. A persistent rumour is that a now long-dead duke drowned his young wife after marrying her at the stone circle, and that the woman returned as a vengeful spirit who can take on the form of a swan. This old rumour has now become conflated with newer rumours about the very real [[Vigilante|vigilante]] known as the [[Lucretzia Marthane|Night Swan]]. Rumours also alternately claim that Lauchlein Lake is the home of either a serial killer or a murderous trio of kelpies.


## Inhabitants

> In truth, Lauchlein Lake does have a mysterious inhabitant but none of the rumours about her nature is quite correct. Atratus is the lake's sole guardian and has kept the lake a wild and beautiful place since the time of the fey courts. Atratus is a [[Swan maiden|swan maiden]], a fey protector of the wilds, who finds the presence of the nearby Oppara Highway disgraceful.
