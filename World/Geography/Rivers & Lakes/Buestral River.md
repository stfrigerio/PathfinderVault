> The **Buestral River** rises in the south-western corner of the vast [[Shudderwood]], in the county of [[Lozeri]] in [[Ustalav]]. It flows for about fifty-five miles in a north-easterly direction until it meets the [[Calscroix River]]. The confluence of these two rivers then runs practically due north for a further ten miles or so before it joins the major [[Moutray River]] at the northern border of Lozeri. The Buestral's run is completely within the Shudderwood.
