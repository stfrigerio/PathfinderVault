> The **Junira** is a major river in northern [[Garund]]. It flows north from the [[Barrier Wall]] into the [[Inner Sea]]. In addition to providing a source of water for the city of [[Lamasara]] on its western banks, it also serves as the border between the nations of [[Thuvia]] and [[Osirion]]. There are two sets of ruins near where the river meets the [[Scarab River]]. On opposite banks, they are the [[Ruins of Akhenaten]] in Thuvia and the [[Ruins of El-Amara]] in Osirion.
> Unlike the [[River Sphinx]], Junira has no flood cycle and the land surrounding it is mostly infertile desert. Aside from a few stretches of canyon, the river flows between gentle, sandy banks. Its few reedy stretches hide [[Crocodile|crocodiles]] and some areas holding forested swamps are home to [[Nuckelavee|nuckelavees]]â€”evil [[Fey|fey]] that attack anybody that despoils the land's natural state.
