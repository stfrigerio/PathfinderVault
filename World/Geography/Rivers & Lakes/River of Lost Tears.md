> The **River of Lost Tears** rises in the [[Bandu Hills]], and flows via [[Fort Bandu]], [[Stark Point]] and [[Kalabuto]] into the [[Lake of Vanished Armies]].
> It forms the border in that region between [[Sargava]] and the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. The garrison of Fort Bandu are attempting to build a bridge across the river, but so far this has been thwarted by attacks from the local [[Bandu]] tribe.
