*For another meaning of "Skunk River", please see [[Skunk River Isger]].*
> The **Skunk River** rises and flows through the [[Narlmarches]] in the [[River Kingdoms]] until it enters the [[Tuskwater]] lake. Its name is derived from the unpleasant stench that fills the air, which is continuously fed from the source of the river's water upstream. The Skunk River averages 100 feet wide and 30 feet deep, the depth of the river makes attempts at crossing it dangerous.
