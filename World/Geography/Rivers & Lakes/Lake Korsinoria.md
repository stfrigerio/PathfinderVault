> **Lake Korsinoria** is the largest and most southerly of a sequence of three lakes in southern [[Varno]], a county of [[Ustalav]] known to have particularly rough waters. The lake lies to the north of the settlement of [[Corvischior]] and [[Castle Corvischior]], which is sometime designated Korsinoria Palace. There are caverns underneath the lake known to and used by the current lord of Castle Corvischior, [[Ristomaur Tiriac|Count Ristomaur Tiriac]]. All three lakes in the sequence lie to the east of the [[Forest of Veils]]. Its two companion lakes, [[Drakeye]] and [[Lake Eirio]], are located to its north. No significant rivers flow out of any of these lakes.
