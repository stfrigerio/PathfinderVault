**Lake Sorrow** is the largest body of fresh water in [[Cheliax]]. Located on the eastern border of the [[Egobarius Plain]], and just south of the [[Barrowood]], the lake is fed by the three major waterways of western Cheliax: the [[Sedna River|Sedna]], [[Tomarsulk River|Tomarsulk]], and [[Adivian River|Adivian]] rivers.
> Cheliax's capital of [[Egorian]] lies on the lake's edge.
