> The **River Esk** (sometimes referred to as the **Esk River**) is a tributary, with the [[Kestrel River]], of the [[Path River]]. It begins in the north-easternmost [[Mindspin Mountains]] of the [[Hold of Belkzen]] and flows generally eastward past the seasonal [[Flood Road]], through the [[Ghostlight Marsh]], and from there into the nation of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] where it joins with the Kestrel.
> The [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisian]] caravan route known as the Sklarkari follows the Esk from the Mindspin Mountains to the city of [[Vigil]] to the east.


## History

> The banks of the Esk were used as part of the defensive line created by the Lastwall General Harchist against the [[Orc|orc]] forces of the north; it eventually fell in [[4237 AR]].
