> The **Brokenbridge River** is a tributary of the [[Verduran Fork]] that begins in the southern foothills of the [[Fog Peaks]] in [[Taldor]]. It flows eastward from its source into the [[Tandak Plains]], where it is joined by the smaller [[Fog Creek]], and turns southwards. It flows southwards for hundreds of miles, passing the town of [[Yanmass]] before it joins the [[Falling River]] to become the Verduran Fork.
