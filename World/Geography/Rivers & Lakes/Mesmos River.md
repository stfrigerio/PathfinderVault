> The **Mesmos River** rises in the [[Hungry Mountains]] in the heart of [[Virlych]] county in south-eastern [[Ustalav]]. It travels in a south-westerly direction to join the [[Path River]], as one of the Path's major tributaries, at the border of Ustalav with [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]]. In total, the river is about fifty miles long. The Mesmos, along with the [[Barrow Run]], form a boundary between different weather patterns in the Hungry Mountains and Virlych: to the west of these two rivers, angry, purple clouds adorn the mountain peaks in some way controlled by the malevolent spirit of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]]; to the east, violent storms wrack the mountains.
