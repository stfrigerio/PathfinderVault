> The **Braid** is a massive "reverse waterspout" in the [[Darklands]] level of [[Orv]]. It links the [[Sightless Sea]] with the [[Inverted Sea]]. It forms at the centre of the Sunless Sea, below what was once the [[Azlant]] Empire.
> It is several miles wide, and a mile high, spiralling up to the roof of the vault containing the Sightless Sea. 
> It establishes a current which flows from the Sightless Sea flows up the Braid, through the Inverted Sea, into the [[Arcadian Ocean]] and then into the [[Inner Sea]]. From there it seeps down into [[Lake Nirthran]] and eventually finds its way back into the Sightless Sea.
