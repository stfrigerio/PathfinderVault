> The **Foam River** (often referred to as the **River Foam**) is a tributary of the [[Andoshen River]] of northwestern [[Andoran]]. It skirts the southern foothills of [[Droskar's Crag|Droskars Crag]] before cutting across the [[Darkmoon Plain]] between the [[Five Kings Mountains|Five Kings]] and [[Aspodell Mountains]] and flows in an easterly direction through [[Darkmoon Vale]]. It runs past the small town of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] and punches through the Wolfrun Hills via a narrow gorge filled with rapids and shallows before joining the Andoshen. The river is less than 150 miles in length in its entirety.
> The River Foam cannot serve as a highway. Not even riverboats can pass through the [[Wolfrun Rapids]]. The few ferries and boats on the river were carried overland or built on the river. No bridge spans the river, but two fords and one ferry provide ways across the Foam. One of the river's fords lies a few miles upriver from the remains of a bridge that was destroyed in the [[Rending]] of [[3980 AR]] and the other lies just upriver from where the Foam joins the Andoshen. The only ferry crosses the river at Falcon's Hollow.
> In the spring and autumn, the river is filled with large, silver-flanked salmon, spawning at the base of [[Gold Falls]]. Crawdads, otters, fisks, marles, herons, and [[Alligator|alligators]] live all along the river. Occasionally [[Reefclaw|reefclaws]] and [[Water naga|water nagas]] make their way to the river.
