> The **Brimstone Falls** is a 60-foot-tall waterfall on the [[Kurka River]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] that flows into a wide lagoon at the edge of the Kurka Swamp. The many small channels that form the cataract throw up enough spray that a permanent rainbow hangs above it. The slope of the waterfall's cliff is not steep, and numerous switchback trails climb up its face.
