> The **Terwa River** rises in the [[Terwa Uplands]] in the [[Shackles]]. It flows north and east, past the trading post of [[Neruma]], into [[Terwa Lake|Lake Terwa]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].
> From there it flows north, becoming the southernmost of the four major rivers that flow through the [[Sodden Lands]]. For much of its course it forms the border between the Shackles, and then the Sodden Lands, and the Mwangi Expanse. It flows into the [[Arcadian Ocean]] close to the edge of the [[Eye of Abendego]].
