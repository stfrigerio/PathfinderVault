> The **Yhalt River** is a tributary of the mighty [[Sellen River]] that spends its entire length passing through a number of [[River Kingdoms]]. It begins high in the eastern Branthlend Mountains in the border region between [[Brevoy]] and the River Kingdoms, and flows south past the [[Thousand Voices]] forest to the east before being joined by the Pitax River at the town of [[Voluse]]. It continues south from there near the town of Avondale and is joined by the Red Reed River soon thereafter. After this, it turns west and flows past the city of [[Gralton]], after which it turns to the southwest and finally flows into the Sellen River north of the Cordelon Forest.
