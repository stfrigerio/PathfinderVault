> The **Malvesa River** (or **River Malvesa**) is a major tributary of the [[Iseld River]] in central [[Cheliax]], and flows from the southern [[Menador Mountains]] in a generally southwesterly direction into the plains north of the [[Whisperwood]] where it is joined by the [[Doracium River]]. From there, it turns south and cuts through the Whisperwood east of the [[Scar Thicket]], finally joining the Iseld at the town of [[Senara]].
