> The Alken Falls are a seven-hundred-foot fall cascade where the [[Ustradi River]] plunges over the [[Hellfallen Cliffs]].  [[Alkenstar City]], with its steaming factories and turning gears, stands proudly atop the Falls.  Meanwhile, the town of [[Martel]] rests at the foot of the waterfall, its two landmark towers climbing the full height of the cliff to connect with the main city above.
