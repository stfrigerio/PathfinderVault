> The Iceflow originates in [[Winterwall Glacier]] and flows south to join the [[Rimeflow River]].
> The **Iceflow** river flows out of the vast [[Winterwall Glacier]] and then forms, for its entire length outside the glacier, the border between the nations of [[Irrisen]] and the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. As the border is contested, the western banks are heavily patrolled by [[Freyr Darkwine]]'s [[Blackravens]] as they are in his kingdom of [[Hagreach]]. After about 170 miles of meandering, the river becomes a tributary of the mighty [[Rimeflow River]].
