> The **Caltherium** is a lake of [[Black blood|black blood]] in the vault of [[Orv]] known as the [[Land of Black Blood]]. Physical exploration of the lake's depths is difficult because of the freezing cold nature of black blood. However, the lake also somehow prevents magical attempts to chart its depths.
> As a result, no one has ever been able to establish the actual depth of the lake, but it is at least two hundred feet deep. It covers an area of roughly a square mile, and strange waves and fogs sometimes rise from its waters. There is life in the lake â€“ blind cave fish, frogs, and much more dangerous creatures such as [[Charda|chardas]] and (sometimes) the fearsome [[Moldering Emperor]]. It is also believed to have connections to the realms of the [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]].
