> The **Ustradi River** begins in the [[Shattered Range]] within the magic-blasted [[Mana Wastes]], flowing gradually northward into [[Nex]] before meeting the [[Elemion River]] and emptying into the [[Obari Ocean]] at [[Quantium]]. At the [[Hellfallen Cliffs]], where the industrial city of [[Alkenstar City]] stands, the river plummets over seven hundred feet over the edifice in the impressive [[Alken Falls]].
> The river has been prone to exude [[Poison|poisonous]] vapours and shimmer in strange colours from time to time, due to the mutating effects of the Mana Wastes. Perhaps more disturbingly, it is not uncommon for bizarre creatures and curious shaped things to be sighted floating downriver.
