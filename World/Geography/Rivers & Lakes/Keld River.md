> The **Keld River** (also known as the **River Keld**) is located in central [[Avistan]], flowing from its source in the [[Aspodell Mountains]] in [[Cheliax]] in a southwesterly direction before meeting up with the [[Iseld River]] and flowing into the [[Inner Sea]]. Its source is located near the point where [[Isger]], Cheliax, and [[Andoran]] meet, and for much of its early journey the river forms the border between the first two countries. It flows past the blackened remains of the [[Chitterwood]] as it follows the foothills of the Aspodells. Once it joins the Iseld past the Chelaxian town of [[Misarias]], it is wholly within the latter country, bisecting the [[Whisperwood]].
