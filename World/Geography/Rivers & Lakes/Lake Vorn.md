> The largest of the features that make up the [[Northern Cascade]], **Lake Vorn** is a freshwater lake nestled high up in the mountains of the [[Brazen Peaks]]. The lake is fed by snow melt from the surrounding peaks, and excess water flows down the [[Viper's Tongue|Vipers Tongue]] waterfall into [[Lake Fors]] below. Due to the Viper's Tongue, its high altitude, and remote location, very few boats ever navigate Lake Vorn's surface.
> This is not helped by rumors of the feared [[Vorndra]], a legendary lake monster that supposedly haunts Lake Vorn's depths. Descriptions of the Vorndra range from serpentine and draconic (possibly describing aquatic menaces like the [[Sea serpent|sea serpent]] or the [[Gandareva|gandareva]]) to tentacled and beaked (more resembling sea monsters like the [[Kraken|kraken]] or [[Devilfish|devilfish]]). Skeptics claim there is no way a large creature could dwell in Lake Vorn because it is too small and there is no way for it to leave the lake. Some who have ventured to the remote lake have found crude altars and horrid offerings around the lake's edge, and real or not, the Vorndra definitely has something that worships it.
