> The **Tuskwater** is a brown, rocky lake in the [[Stolen Lands]], surrounded by cliffs and steep hills. Nearly every river in the [[Kamelands]] and [[Narlmarches]] lead, inevitably, to Tuskwater.   The lake experience seasonal floods, brought on by the spring thaw, spilling out into ravines along its length to the west. These floods create gullies of pits of standing water that explode the local populations of mosquitoes, [[Stirge|stirges]], snakes, and [[Assassin vine|assassin vines]].  
> At its depths, the Tuskwater is bountiful, roiling with pike, longnose gar, bluegill, and fanged eels. The eels in particular are heavily valued, considered a rare delicacy on the tables of [[New Stetven]] and greater [[Brevoy]], and the fisherman who plumb the depths of the lake are slow to give up the secrets of avoiding their vicious bites, and grasping their slippery skins.
