The Olongo River's source, with Gorilla Falls at top right.
> 
The **Olongo River** rises from the [[Barrier Wall]] north of the [[Mwangi Jungle]], tumbles down Gorilla Falls, then flows southwesterly along the jungle's edge to the ruins of [[Sele]], where the [[Mbernbe River]] joins it. From there, it winds south and west into the jungle, passing [[Jaha]] and being joined by the [[Defaka River]] before it empties into [[Lake Ocota]].
