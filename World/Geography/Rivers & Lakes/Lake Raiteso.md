> **Lake Raiteso** is a large lake in the north of [[Caliphas]], a county of [[Ustalav]]. At its widest points the lake measures some 20 miles by 15 miles. The lake nestles into the southern peaks of the [[Hungry Mountains]] and, for over half its circumference, from its south-west to its north-east, its northernmost shores mark the border between Caliphas and the neighbouring county of [[Amaans]]. From its southern reaches the [[Raiteso River]] flows south out of the lake while the [[Carabosse River]] heads south-west. On the lake's eastern shores is found [[Chateau Douleurs]], owned by the [[House Caliphvaso|Caliphvaso]] family.
