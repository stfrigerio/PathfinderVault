> The **Detstach River**, sometimes spelt **Destach River**, rises in [[Lantern Lake]] in the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Versex]] and runs south-east into the [[Forest of Veils]] where, about 40 miles later, it meets the [[Nicklecross River]] in the middle of that forest. Shortly after this confluence, the river turns through a long bend within the Forest of Veils to flow west, eventually flowing through the marsh known as [[Soddentimbers]]. Finally, the Detstach enters the north-east of [[Avalon Bay]] just south of the small town of [[Illmarsh]]. From its source, the Detstach River is some 120 miles long.
> For about a quarter of its length, the Detstach River forms the border between Versex and [[Varno]].
> The river is quite treacherous and known to run fast and deep.
