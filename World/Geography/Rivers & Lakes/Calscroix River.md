> The **Calscroix River** rises in the southern [[Shudderwood]], in the county of [[Lozeri]] in [[Ustalav]]. Initially making a large 'U'-shaped turn to run in a north-easterly direction, the river flows for about thirty-five miles until it is met by its tributary, the [[Mothburn]]. The river's 'U'-turn passes [[Ascanor Lodge]] on its northern banks. The Calscroix then turns north to join the [[Buestral River]] at their confluence twenty-five miles further downstream. The combined river then runs practically due north for a further ten miles or so before it joins the major [[Moutray River]] at the northern border of Lozeri. The Calscroix's seventy miles' total length is completely within the Shudderwood.
