> The **Pale River** begins in the [[Brazen Peaks]] of northwestern [[Katapesh]] and flows from there through the [[Uwaga Highlands]] into the plains below. The river begins near [[Pale Mountain]] and is fed by the snow melt from the surrounding peaks; from there, it flows in a southeasterly direction until it meets with the water coming from the [[Hammerfalls]], after which it flows out of the mountains.
> The Pale River is not a particularly large river, but it is both deep and quick-moving, particularly after the spring melt. This speed means the river's waters often form foamy whitecaps, leading to the nickname of **Ale River**. Outside of the mountains, the river is often used as a trade route allowing trade between [[Bronze Hook]], [[Thricehill]], and communities even further downriver.
