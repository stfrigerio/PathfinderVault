Nation: Mwangi Expanse

> Countless adventurers have set off into the [[Mwangi Expanse]] in search of the fabled Fountain of Youth. It remains undiscovered (unless legendary [[Pathfinder]] [[Durvin Gest]] actually managed to find it).
> However, the **Fountain of Tabis** in the north eastern [[Mwangi Jungle]] does grant youth â€“ at a price. Whoever drinks from it dies, and is then reincarnated as a young child (and not necessarily of the same race or gender) with very little memory of their previous life.
> The locals do their utmost to prevent outsiders from drinking from the fountain, but adopt any who succeed and raise them as part of the tribe. Especially honoured tribal members may be allowed to drink from the fountain when they become old or infirm.
