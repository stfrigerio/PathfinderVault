> **Broken Hope River** is the main waterway of [[Raptor Island]], one of the westernmost islands of the [[Shackles]]. Its mouth is near [[Dead Slave Cove]], the barren beach that is used by the [[Free Captains]] to deposit the poor souls destined to spend the rest of their life on Raptor Island. The farther one travels from the river, the grassy hills that roll along the island's interior become drier. [[Fort Holiday]] is located atop a rocky hill of the island, at the fork of the Broken Hope River and its main tributary.
