> **Gozreh's Pool** is located in the [[Mwangi Jungle]], north of the [[Ocota River]]. It is 15 feet across and is nearly a perfect circle. The unusually cool and clear pool is home to a pair of [[Water elemental|water elementals]], which require that the pool is shown the proper respect—typically evidenced by some form of prayer or sacrifice—before it is approached.
> A dip in the pool is refreshing, and also reputed to cure any [[Disease|disease]] or parasitic infection contracted in the jungle.
