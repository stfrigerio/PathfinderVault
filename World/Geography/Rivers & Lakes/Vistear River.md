> The **Vistear River** flows east from its source: [[Lake Lias]], in the county of [[Canterwall]] in [[Ustalav]]. After some twenty miles, the Vistear is joined from the south by its first main tributary, the [[Redwool River]], and a further ten miles on, it is joined from the north by the [[Lamand River]]. From this confluence with the Lamand on, the Vistear forms the border between Canterwall and its neighbouring county of [[Lozeri]]. The river then passes the settlement of [[Bladswell]] on its southern bank and, subsequently, dives into a forested stretch with the mighty [[Shudderwood]] on its northern banks and the [[Eshirwood]] to the south. Leaving the forests, the river veers into a north-easterly flow, skirting the [[Sclerain Swamp]] to its south, and then joins the long [[Vhatsuntide River]] at the Lozeri 'city' of [[Chastel]]. From Lake Lias to Chastel the river is some ninety miles long. The people of Canterwall consider their county to be blessed by the fertile waters of the Vistear.
