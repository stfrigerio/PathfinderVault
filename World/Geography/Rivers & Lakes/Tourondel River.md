> The **Tourondel River** runs west to east forming the border between the nations of [[Nirmathas]] and [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], and splitting the [[Fangwood Forest]] into its [[Northern Fangwood|northern]] and [[Southern Fangwood|southern]] portions. It begins high in the central [[Mindspin Mountains]] of [[Varisia]] east of [[Janderhoff]] and flows east into Nirmathas where it is joined by the [[Shining River]] north of [[Marching Springs]]. After passing the Lastwall settlement of [[Roslar's Coffer|Roslars Coffer]], it flows into the Fangwood, passing the Nirmathi town of [[Kassen]] and [[Three Pines Ford]] in Lastwall. It eventually spills into [[Lake Encarthan]] between the towns of [[Tamran]] and [[Vellumis]], with [[Crowstump]] near its mouth.
