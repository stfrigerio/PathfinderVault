> The **Southern Usk River** begins in the northern [[Menador Mountains]] of [[Cheliax]] and flows north (and spends most of its course) in the darkened realm of [[Nidal]]. It forms the western border of the [[Uskwood]], and keeps the [[North Plains]] to its east. It joins the [[Usk River]] southeast of the port city of [[Nisroch]].
