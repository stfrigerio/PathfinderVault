> **Old Frog Swamp** covers the southern riverbank near the [[Grackle River]]'s source in [[Isger]], near the town of [[Dustpawn]]. The loamy wetlands are pocked with small caves and infested with a wide range of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Frog|frogs]], including several dangerous giant bullfrogs. 
> Edible herbs and roots are readily found in the swamp, and a cave once used as a landmark for fishers sits atop a 30-foot ridge across a narrow stretch of river from the swamp. [[Leeara Mulvayne]] often uses the cave to stash valuables and as a camp when foraging for ingredients.
