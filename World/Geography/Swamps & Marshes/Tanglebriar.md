 The [[Witchbole]] is the heart of the Tanglebriar

> The **Tanglebriar** is a vast swamp in southern [[Kyonin]], wedged between the [[Fierani Forest]] to the north and the [[Five Kings Mountains]] to the south. Although technically within the borders of [[Kyonin]], it has become the largely uncontested domain of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Treerazer]] since he was driven there by the returning [[Sovyrian]] [[Elf|elves]] in [[2632 AR]]. The realm grows ever more in appearance like Treerazer's lost [[Abyss|Abyssal]] home.



## History

> The elves of Kyonin have worked for two millennia to contain the spreading taint of the Tanglebriar. For now, they have succeeded in containing the threat. Recently, since the closure of the [[Worldwound]] in [[4718 AR]], holy warriors have left [[Mendev]] for Kyonin to offer their [[Demon|demon-fighting]] expertise to the elves.


## Flora & Fauna

> The Tanglebriar is a dark and twisted swamp, haunted by [[Demon|demons]] and creatures corrupted by centuries of the demon lord's foul influences. Trees block out the [[Sun|sun]] and [[Plant|plants]] have taken on a decidedly hostile appearance and nature. True to its name, thick patches of nettles and prickly briers cover the land, interspersed with [[Poison|poisonous]] [[Fungus|fungi]] and mold.
> In addition to the ubiquitous demons (primarily [[Hezrou|hezrou]], [[Glabrezu|glabrezu]], [[Babau|babaus]], and [[Nalfeshnee|nalfeshnee]]) that roam the Tanglebriar individually or in small gangs looking for their next victim, the region is also home to other sinister creatures. These include [[Dark fey|dark fey]], [[Fiendish|fiendish]] [[Vermin|vermin]] grown to alarming size, evil cultists from all over who bring supplies and news of the outside world to Treerazer, and carnivorous fungi ([[Ascomoid|ascomoids]], [[Basidirond|basidironds]], [[Violet fungus|violet fungi]], and [[Phycomid|phycomids]]).
> The Tanglebriar is also home to several small tribes of [[Orc|orcs]] who devoutly worship Treerazer. These orcs compensate for their comparative lack of numbers and the lesser status of their chosen god by being exceptionally violent and vicious, even by orc standards.


### Demons of note

> The glabrezu demon [[Mokravud]] is one of Treerazer's lieutenants, and unusually for his type, practices great patience and subtlety when targeting his victims. He has served the Lord of the Blasted Tarn for centuries, and prefers going after select elven officers, rather than decimating entire platoons.
