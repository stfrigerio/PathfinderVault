> Growing in [[Brinestump Marsh]], the brinestump clover is cultivated by [[Boggard|boggards]] for its [[Medicine|medical]] qualities. The flower of this plant is only found in the marsh. If the flowers are steeped in boiling water and added to a poultice, they also delay [[Poisons of Golarion|poison]] for five minutes when eaten. [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|Alchemists]] can even mix the flowers of brinestump clover with [[Potion|healing potions]] to make them slightly stronger.
