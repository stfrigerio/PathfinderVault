> **Vargas Swamp** is the largest swamp in the predominantly dry country of [[Katapesh]], spanning almost 30 miles in length and half that in width. Located in north-central Katapesh, myriad trees, herbs, and grasses grow there, attracting herbivores and their predators. A small tribe of [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] makes its home here as well.
> Vargas Swamp also contains numerous ruins and the skeletons of old villages (such as [[Slither Cove]]), that were swallowed by the rising water levels, which can fluctuate unpredictably. Some blame this strange occurrence on a [[Green dragon|green dragon]] said to live in the swamp, although this has never been proven.
