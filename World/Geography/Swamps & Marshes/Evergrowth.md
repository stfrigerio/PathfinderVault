> The **evergrowth** is a verdant swampland filled with a huge variety of plants not found anywhere else in [[Katapesh]], a natural wonder and a naturalist's dream. 
> Evergrowth is covered in a canopy of verdant green growth shot through with beams of sunlight. It teems with life, and is filled with a wide variety of insects, reptiles, birds, and small mammals. Unfortunately, this abundance has led to fierce creatures that prey on this life, like [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] and the only [[Kobold|kobolds]] in all of Katapesh, making the evergrowth their home. Despite these dangers, there are no end to the people willing to venture into the swamp to find rare herbs and plants.
