> The **Karsule Swampland** of [[Motaku Isle]] in the [[Shackles]] covers the south and east parts of the isle. A large number of [[Fuath|fuath]] gremlins and their cohorts populate the northeastern marshes around the [[Pit of Raugsmauda]], and many vodyanoi tribes live along the lazy rivers that wind their way south. In the center of Karsule Swampland lies the [[Lukwata|lukwata]]-infested [[Glittering Lake]]. It is said that pirate captains submerged entire chests of gold into the lake's murky waters.
