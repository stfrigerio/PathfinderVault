> The **Frostmire Fen** is a cold, stinking marshland located in the northwestern region of the [[Worldwound]] known as [[Frostmire]]. It is best known as the realm of the [[Fungus queen|fungus queens]] who worship the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Cyth-V'sug|Cyth-Vsug]].



## Geography

> Frostmire Fen is a frigid marshland over 150 miles long from north to south, and anywhere from 50 to 100 miles in width. It borders the hills known as the [[Wolfcrags]] to the north and northwest and the former forest called the [[Shroud of Unicorns]] to the northeast. To the east it borders the twisted canyons of the ever expanding [[Worldwound]] of the [[Wounded Lands]], while to the south lies the [[Riftshadow]], and to the west, the [[Sarkorian Steppe]]. Most of the rivulets and streams of the Fen eventually feed into the  [[Sarkora River]] that flows through it in a generally southern direction. The constant cold winds that blow through the region keep much of the Fen frozen for most of the year, with the exception of the areas around the many sulfurous hot springs that dot the wetlands. These hot springs become the major source of life-sustaining heat, making them natural centers of both plant and animal life.


## History

> Even before the opening of the Worldwound in [[4606 AR]], the Frostmire Fen (except for the city of [[Dyinglight]]) was largely uninhabited by the [[Kellid]] [[Human|human]] tribes that lived in [[Sarkoris]]. Small clans of [[Marsh giant|marsh giants]] dwelled here, always in competition with the humans and the [[Fungus queen|fungus queens]] that lived around the sulfurous hot springs. Thanks to a divine warning from their patron (the [[Empyreal Lord]] [[Pulura]]), the Kellid tribes evacuated Dyinglight before the [[Demon|demonic]] onslaught. The marsh giants left the Fen for the abandoned Dyinglight soon thereafter, leaving the swamps to the fungus queens and their minions.


## Inhabitants

> The Frostmire Fen today is the uncontested domain of the fungoid followers of the demon lord Cyth-V'sug. All life in the marshes tends to center around the hot springs, as the northern climate keeps most of the remaining water frozen for most of the year. Most of the animals who dwell in Frostmire Fen that have not succumbed to the fungus queen's corruption have taken on [[Fiendish|fiendish]] characteristics in the past few generations. This includes the [[Fiendish marsh giant|fiendish marsh giants]] that live in the area of the fens that surround [[Dyinglight]].


### Fungus Queens

> The fungus queens loyal to Cyth-V'sug are the only remaining power center of Frostmire Fen, as the desolate region is of little interest to the demonic hordes fighting the [[Mendevian Crusaders]] far to the east and south. They once had competition from the local bands of marsh giants who made their home here as well, but they migrated to the abandoned city of Dyinglight soon after the opening of the Worldwound. Each of the fungus queens lays claim to a small patch of marshland centered around one of the many sulfurous hot springs that dot the area. The fungus queens in turn are led by their high priestess, [[Enivuni]]. The fungus queens act as a center of corruption, slowly transforming the flora and fauna around them.
