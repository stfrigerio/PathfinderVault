> **Brinestump Marsh** is a small wetlands region in southwestern [[Varisia]] just south of the town of [[Sandpoint]].


## Inhabitants

> Brinestump Marsh is home to a well-known [[Goblin|goblin]] tribe known as the [[Licktoad goblins|Licktoads]], and also to a notorious goblin [[Cannibal|cannibal]] named [[Vorka]]. [[Old Megus|Old Megus the Swamp Witch]], also lived within the swamp, and her presence kept locals truly at bay. However, Megus has since died, leaving her [[Ratling|ratling]] [[Familiar|familiar]] Skitterfoot behind. The marsh is also home to a creature known as the "Soggy River Monster", in truth a [[Sinspawn|sinspawn]] escaped from the catacombs beneath Sandpoint. A tribe of [[Faceless stalker|faceless stalkers]] also inhabit the marsh, but largely died out due to inbreeding and malnutrition, leaving only a few undersized survivors behind. Brinestump Marsh has recently also become home to the [[Halfling|halfling]] Walthus Proudstump, an escaped [[Slave|slave]] from [[Cheliax]] seeking isolation and anonymity.
> Other creatures that make the marsh their home include [[Giant gecko|giant geckos]], [[Goblin snake|goblin snakes]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|constrictor snakes]], and giant leeches.


## Geography

> Brinestump Marsh is located in the [[Soggy River]] delta, just west of the [[Lost Coast Road]], and is just over two miles in length and less than a mile wide. It is covered in thick, tangled vegetation, consisting chiefly of cypress, eucalyptus, oak, and willow over an undergrowth of reeds, nettles, and other swamp [[Plant|plants]]. The trees grow high and thickly together, and obscure most structures within the marsh. A high cliff surrounds the swamp, which curls around [[Sog's Bay|Sogs Bay]] in the [[Varisian Gulf]]. A cave system known as the Brinestump Caverns extends beneath the wetland.
> Two pathways cut through the marsh, the New Fish Trail and the Old Fish Trail, established to give Sandpoint [[World/Items & Equipment/Trade Goods/Fish|fishermen]] access to the swamp's fishing holes. The Old Fish Trail has since fallen into disuse due to the Licktoad goblins establishing their villages at its end. The wrecks of the *Kaijitsu's Blossom* and the *Kaijitsu Star* also lie within the marsh.
