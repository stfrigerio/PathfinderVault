> The **Dunmire** is a vast bog north of the [[Kortos Mounts]] on the [[Isle of Kortos]]. It is plagued by thick fogs, but its waters are rarely more than knee-deep. A haven of filth and [[Disease|disease]], the Dunmire is home to [[Kobold|kobolds]], [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], [[Hag|hags]], and criminals looking to flee the law of [[Absalom]]. A strange environmental disturbance known as the Welt grows from the Dunmire's western border, and expands westwardly year by year. The [[First Guard|First Guards]] [[Eagle Garrison]] gave up patrolling the bog long ago, making the entire area outside the direct control of Absalom. The only permanent settlement there is [[Pier's End|Piers End]], which sits on a deep harbor and offers inexpensive ferries to the nearby island of [[Escadar]] to those who can survive crossing the bog.
