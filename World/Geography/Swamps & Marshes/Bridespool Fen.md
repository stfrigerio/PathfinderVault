> Unlike the other lakes of the [[Sarkorian Steppe]], some moisture remains in the lake of **Bridespool**, which has turned it into a rancid bog called **Bridespool Fen**. The swamp is infested by dangerous fungi, filth-encrusted [[Gibrileth|gibrileths]], and [[Hezrou|hezrous]].
> The [[Demon|demons]] dwelling here are known as the [[Plaguemasters of the Bride]]. They reside in numerous filth-hovels and rancid fortresses, and they search for new [[Disease|contagions]] to unleash upon the world. The high concentrations of the [[Demonplague|demonplague]] in Bridespool Fen lend credence to theories that the infamous malady began here.
