> **Eridanos** is an ocean-sized marsh in [[Avernus]] formed by a cascade of countless foul arteries of strange fluids which wash a portion of the [[Maelstrom]]'s refuse into [[Hell]]. The [[Great Beyond|multiverses]] refuse is mixed with the souls of the damned and the eroded sediments of Hell; then the noxious mixture forms the headwaters of the infamous [[River Styx]] which flows through the planes.
