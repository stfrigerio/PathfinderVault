> The **Dhaenfens** are wetlands composed of small waterways, lakes, and bogs that begin where the upper [[River Adivian|Adivian River]] ends, 25 miles northwest of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Westcrown]]. The marsh is haunted by a variety of monsters, and holds the crumbling castle ruin called the [[Dhaenhold]].
