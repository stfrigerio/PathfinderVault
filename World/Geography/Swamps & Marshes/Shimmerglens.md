> The **Shimmerglens** are a small wetland area found between the [[Sanos Forest]] and the [[Skull River]] in central [[Varisia]].  The swamps are well-known to be the home of [[Fey|fey]] and fey-like creatures, especially where they border on the Sanos Forest.  Hunters and trappers from the nearby village of [[Bitter Hollow]] know to stay within sight of [[Claybottom Lake]], considering all territory beyond to be the domain of the denizens of the Shimmerglens.
