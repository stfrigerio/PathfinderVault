> The **Dippelmere Swamp** is found in the north-eastern corner of the county of [[Vieland]], in [[Ustalav]]. This extension of the vast [[Shudderwood]] is a boggy area within the quasi-island formed by the [[Moutray River|Lesser Moutray River]] and the [[Troll's Tail|Trolls Tail]] river. On the opposite bank of the Lesser Moutray stands the county seat of [[Lepidstadt]] and, sharing the quasi-island, is [[Schloss Caromarc]]. It is thought that the presence of the Dipplemere protected the founders of Lepidstadt from [[Orc|orcs]] and [[Kellid]]-folk and allowed that city to grow. The Dipplemere, itself, is infamous for its burgeoning population of [[Troll|trolls]] and [[Marsh giant|marsh giants]], as well as swamp lords who reputedly command sentient plant creatures.
