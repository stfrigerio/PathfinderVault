 The Mushfens hide [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] ruins.
> The **Mushfens** are a vast swamp on the southern coast of [[Varisia]], and the largest marsh in all of [[Avistan]]. Despite being located in close proximity to both the cities of [[Magnimar]] and [[Korvosa]], the Mushfens remain a trackless wilderness filled with many unpleasant creatures.



## Geography

> The Mushfens encompasses the land south of the [[Yondabakari River]], from the south-westernmost tip of Varisia (known as the [[Lady's Cape|Ladys Cape]]) all the way to the aptly named [[Fenwall Mountains]] in the east. The Mushfens did not exist as a swamp until the earth-shattering cataclysm brought on by [[Earthfall]] over 10,000 years ago. Before this time the area was a land-locked part of the ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] realm of [[Eurythnia]]. The earthquakes and tidal waves caused by the impacts of the [[Starstone]] caused the majority of that kingdom to sink below the waters of the [[Varisian Gulf]].  Over the course of millennia, the drastic lowering of the countryside, combined with its new proximity to the sea turned the land into the swamp it is today.


## Flora and fauna

> Unusual plants grow wild in the swamps of the Mushfens, many of them used by cooks to season local dishes. These include [[Whiplily|whiplily]], [[Frog's eye|frogs eye]], [[Miresh|miresh]], and [[Fen pepper|fen pepper]]. Enterprising restaurateurs occasionally hire [[Adventurer|adventurers]] to brave the dangers of the Mushfens to harvest them.
> The Mushfens are known to be home to a variety of unpleasant denizens, including the shape-changing [[Faceless stalker|faceless stalkers]], [[Goblin|goblins]], [[Black dragon|black dragons]], [[Marsh giant|marsh giants]], [[Boggard|boggards]], and their monstrous supposed ancestors, the [[Mobogo|mobogo]]. [[Bunyip|Bunyips]] are also common in the Mushfens, attracted by the extensive shallow waters, lack of widespread civilization and abundant prey. Undead in the form of incorporeal [[Spectre|spectres]] have also been spotted among its fens and marshes. More mundane dangers include [[Fang fly|fang flies]], [[Dragonwasp|dragonwasps]], [[Moss pig|moss pigs]], and [[Swamp barracuda|swamp barracudas]]. Hunters in the Mushfens also trap and skin [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Level 1/Raccoon|raccoons]] for their pelts.


### Black dragons

> Being one of the largest swamp in all of [[Avistan]], marsh-dwelling [[Black dragon|black dragons]] should be abundant in the Mushfens; strangely, the opposite is the case. These wyrms have avoided this part of Varisia for thousands of years, remembering a time when the [[Runelords|runelords]] of Thassilon used powerful magic to enslave their ancestors, forcing them toil as guardians, or even worse, common laborers.  When that ancient empire collapsed after [[Earthfall]], the surviving black dragons fled, vowing never to return. The fact that the Mushfens didn't exist as a swamp in those ancient days does not change their minds; in fact, reminding them of this fact will elicit a distinctly negative response from any black dragon.


### Goblins

> Numerous powerful goblin tribes make their homes in Mushfens, often carving out ancient ruins to build their lairs. Three in particular stand out: the Breakbag, Houndgutter, and Wind Whisper tribes.


## Places of interest

> - [[Green Reef]]: Also known as the Greenrust Reef, this large rock outcropping is a common nautical reference point along the southern coast of the Mushfens.
> - [[Lady's Light|The Ladys Light]]: An ancient Thassilonian statue found on the Lady's Cape.
> - [[Sunken Queen|The Sunken Queen]]: The Mushfens conceal one of the most unique Thassilonian ruins in all of Varisia: the [[Sunken Queen]]. This pyramid is a remnant of ancient Eurythnia and was built by the runelord [[Sorshen]] to house the Everdawn Pool. Like much of the realm of Eurythnia, with the fall of Thassilon, the Sunken Queen slipped into the Mushfens and now rests at a canted angle among the mire.
