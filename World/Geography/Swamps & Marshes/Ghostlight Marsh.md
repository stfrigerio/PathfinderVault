> **Ghostlight Marsh**, sometimes called the **Ghostlake Marsh**, is a swamp surrounding the joining of the [[River Esk|Esk]] and [[Kestrel River|Kestrel]] rivers that is named for the [[Will-o'-wisp|will-o-wisps]] dwelling within its murky depths.



## Geography

> The marsh is comprised of swampland stretching along the River Esk's banks and is known for its unsettling floating lights. It spans the border between the [[Hold of Belkzen]] and [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], and [[Orc|orcs]] and [[Human|humans]] alike avoid it.


## History

> The will-o'-wisps have not always been a part of the marsh. In fact, they are the results of a single great sacrifice made within the marsh in [[4237 AR]], when the [[Orc|orcs]] of the [[Hold of Belkzen]] pushed their southern borders further into [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]]. While most fled in the face of the orc horde, a few stood fast in defense of their homeland. One of these groups was the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druidic]] [[Council of Thorns]], who opposed the devastation the orcs were wreaking on the land.
> They were gradually forced back to the swamp between the [[Flood Road]] and the [[River Esk]], and their final act was to sacrifice themselves in a bloody ritual. As their blood mingled with the swamp water, dozens of lights rose from the murky swamp. Those lights were the Council of Thorns reincarnated as will-o'-wisps who have guarded the Ghostlight Marsh ever since, although rumor has it they do not attack those well attuned to nature. The will-o'-wisps retained memories from their former lives as druids.


## Locations

> An entrance to the Vault of Thorns, a [[Demiplane|demiplane]] of the Council of Thorns, lies within the marsh. A *ghostlight lantern* can guide travelers to the entrance if imbued with the light from a dead will-o'-wisp's husk.
