> **Kuruban Swamp** is a line of heavily wooded islands in [[Vudra|Vudras]] [[Open Bridge]] region that was not fully connected to the mainland when the [[Obari Ocean]] receded in [[4606 AR]]. Instead, the upheaval created a semi-sunken, vast mangrove swamp. Unlike the rest of Open Bridge, which is infested with hordes of horrific [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aberration|aberrations]], Kuruban Swamp is controlled by the [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] who ruthlessly protect its borders. The sahuagin seem to be searching amongst the ancient ruins that dot the swamp but no one knows for what.
