> **Nantambu**, also called the **Song-Wind City**, is a colourful, cheerful city-state in the western [[Mwangi Expanse]]. A haven of peace, learning, and culture within the Expanse, it is home to the [[Magaambya]], one of the oldest [[Arcane magic|arcane]] schools on [[Golarion]].



## Geography

> Nantambu is situated on a canal of the [[Vanji River]], between the [[Aspis Consortium]] outposts of [[Whitebridge Station]] and [[Nightfall Station]]. Districts of Nantambu are demarcated by curving canals and connected by arching bridges. At its heart is the Magaambya's ring of ten terraced towers, which looms over the rest of the city.


## Government

> Nantambu is governed by a council of elected magistrate-mayors, who preside over it and the nearby territory. The city does not threaten its neighbours, and extends its protection to them as well. Despite the lack of formal treaties, neighbouring villages willingly pay tribute to Nantambu, and serve as the city's eyes and ears in the jungle. The tall Nantambiyan Tower houses the *Watcher's Stone* of [[Jatembe]], an ancient [[Magic|magical]] [[Divination|scrying]] globe, which is employed to watch over [[Usaro]] and other threats in the region. The presence of the Magaambya deters aggression against Nantambu, which needs no defensive wall or standing army.


## History

> The city was founded towards the end of the [[Age of Anguish]] by [[Old-Mage Jatembe]] and his [[Ten Magic Warriors]], heroes who sought to bring back learning to the world in the dark times of that Age. Old-Mage Jatembe also established here the [[Magaambya]], the oldest arcane academy in the [[Inner Sea region]].
> The city contributed the illusory Pool of Desire as a Radiant Festival exhibit in [[3820 AR]]. Although the pool was scorned by much of [[Absalom]]'s aristocracy and subsequently drained at the end of the festival it was reinstalled in Nantambu the following year after thousands of Nantambuâ€™s citizens signed a strongly worded petition.


## People

> Nantambu's strength is derived from the Magaambya's emphasis on service: the Tempest-Sun mages of Magaambya ensure that no invader can come within 20 miles of the city, and followers of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Angazhan]] think twice before entering Nantambu lands. The raiders of the Aspis Consortium do not dock in Nantambu for the same reason, and are careful to keep their [[Weapon|weapons]] sheathed when in sight of the town's mosaic-decorated towers.
> Chimes of coloured glass hang from many buildings. They are considered to be signs of good luck, and replicas are sold to visitors, who seek to carry a representation of Nantambu's enlightenment back to their own villages.
> Nantambu is home to [[Sharrowsmith's Exports|Sharrowsmiths Exports]], a small but successful independent exporting company which trades in local produce such as fruit, grain, hardwood, and sugarcane. In fact, the company's premises are the site of a [[Pathfinder lodge]], the largest one in the Mwangi Expanse.
> In addition to the Magaambya, Nantambu's reputation for learning has led to the establishment of many other schools that teach all kinds of disciplines. Everyone with peaceful intentions is welcomed in Nantambu regardless of origin, and its population is remarkably diverse, from [[Ekujae]] [[Elf|elves]], [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]], [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], [[Catfolk|catfolk]], to even the most reclusive species of [[Garund]] like the [[Anadi|anadi]], [[Goloma|goloma]], [[Bestiary/Shisk|shisks]], or [[Bestiary/Conrasu|conrasu]]. The hospitality has only grown since the [[Lake Ocota]] land rushes that followed the fall of the [[Gorilla King]].
