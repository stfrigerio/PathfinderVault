> **Artume** is a small kingdom amid hills and fertile plains within the [[River Kingdoms]]. Artume lies on a western branch of the [[Sellen River]], not far from the cities of [[Daggermark 1]], [[Gralton 1]], and [[Sevenarches]]. The region boasts high-quality livestock, especially [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horses]], as well as leather goods and stone. The kingdom welcomes [[Adventurer|adventurers]], who are frequently requested to deal with bandits and [[Naga|nagas]]. The nation has recently experienced a rebellion, resulting in the overthrow of [[Bransen Waike|Regent Waike]] in favour of Edryd Artume and the restoration of the monarchy.



## Government

> King Edryd Artume rules the nation and is generally regarded as a fair and reasonable leader. His closest advisors are Brother Karyn, a member of the [[Everbloom]] monastery and his mentor since childhood, and [[Sovella Artume|Queen Sovella]]. Some rebels from the time of Waike still rankle at the king's rule, however, and talk of a more democratic system replacing the monarchy.


## History

> After [[Drellis Artume|Lord Drellis Artume]] fell victim to Daggermark [[Poison|poisoners]], Queen Sovella left the kingdom in the hands of [[Bransen Waike|Regent Bransen Waike]], a veteran of the [[Mendev 1|Mendevian]] Crusades and former advisor to the late king, until she bore a son. Waike forsook his Crusader's Oath and attempted to assassinate the queen, usurping the throne for himself. Queen Sovella and her son, Edryd, managed to escape, although Waike claims the queen perished. In fact, the queen went to hiding in the [[Everbloom]] monastery to raise her son as future ruler and to subtly stoke discontent among the citizenry.
> During his rule, Regent Waike struggled to maintain control, as [[Gralton 1]] lured away his mercenary soldiers and nagas made increasingly bold attacks along the river. Waike's thugs collected tribute from the locals rather than dealing with these problems, causing the growing resentment that ultimately led to Waike's overthrow.


## Resources

> Artume is known for some of the finest livestock and leather work in the region, a fact well known to local bandits and [[Cattle|cattle]] rustlers. The local ranchers also breed intelligent and well-trained horses and [[Pony|ponies]].  Because wood is relatively scarce in Artume, local stone is often used in construction, supplied by [[Gnome|gnomish]] rock quarries. [[Ship|Shipwrights]] along the Sellen often import their lumber from nearby Sevenarches or the [[Embeth Forest]].
