> The subregion of **Al-Zabrit** lies deep in the [[Meraz Desert]] of [[Qadira]], and is home to the eponymous, nomadic, [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]]-breeding [[Al-Zabriti]] tribes. It is dotted with oases, many of which are claimed by Al-Zabriti tribes as their private holds demarcated by 50-foot-tall pillars bearing their flags, past which points outsiders are not allowed to enter.
