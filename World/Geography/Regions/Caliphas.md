> The large county of **Caliphas** is the most southerly of the thirteen modern counties of [[Ustalav]] and is one of the counties in the [[Soivoda]] region. The vast majority of its borders are natural: [[Avalon Bay]] provides the south-eastern edge; the [[Path River]] marks the international border between Caliphas and [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]]; the [[Carabosse River]] and [[Lake Raiteso]] provide most of the border with the county of [[Amaans]] to the north-west; this border is completed by an agreed demarcation line through the [[Hungry Mountains]] to the north; and, finally, the [[Danver River]] marks the eastern border of Caliphas with its neighbouring county of [[Versex]].



## The city of Caliphas

> The heart of county Caliphas has always been the city that bears its name, the [[Caliphas city|city of Caliphas]]; some even say the city of Caliphas is the very soul of Ustalav. Recently, in [[4674 AR]], Caliphas ascended to become the nation's capital city demoting [[Ardis]] to being a provincial backwater.


## Economy


### Caliphas city

> Resting on the shores of [[Lake Encarthan]] allows Caliphas to take full advantage of that massive trade route and, as a consequence, Caliphas is a rich city, some might even say decadent. The city is also very cosmopolitan—a relative rarity in suspicious Ustalav—with many travellers visiting from foreign parts; some of these visitors never leave, their disappearances rarely noticed by the population.


### Caliphas county

> The county of Caliphas still maintains much of its rustic heritage being home to agriculture and numerous peat farms. The county is home to many small communities most of which nestle near the [[Droa River|Droa]] or [[Raiteso River|Raiteso]] rivers. As well as traditional rural industries, Caliphas is also the home of many [[Alcoholic beverages|vineyards]], perfumeries and alabaster quarries which specialise in providing luxury goods to the rich of the capital city.


## Military


### Navy

> Ustalav hosts a large naval force within [[Castle Golbanze]] to stage patrols across Lake Encarthan. Led by Admiral [[Marris Riddian]], the navy protects Ustalav's coast from lake pirates, aquatic monsters, and seafaring [[Razmiran]] zealots. Several of the most famed and infamous ships and captains include Captain [[Almira Perine|Almira Cardinal Perine]]'s *Devilfish*, Captain [[Liald Gaspair]]'s *Princess Maraet*, and Captain [[Leos Tailor]]'s *Indomitable*.
