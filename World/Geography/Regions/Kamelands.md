Nation: River Kigndoms

> The **Kamelands** lie along the eastern edge of the [[Stolen Lands]] in the [[River Kingdoms]]. Characterized by rolling hills of brown and yellow, the landscape is notable for its many rocky mounds known as **kames**. It is located in the region known as the [[Greenbelt]].
> Grasses in the Kamelands grow quite tall—sometimes up to 4 feet—and present a difficult barrier to both travel and settlement in the region.
> Among the high grass and rocky hills rise the mysterious kames, mounds of ancient stone and debris. The kames together form great, strange patterns, suggesting waymarkers, barrows, and long-destroyed walls and foundations.
> Very few [[Animal|animals]] live in the Kamelands; its rare occupants include rodents, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fox|foxes]], hares, and [[Wolves|wolves]]. [[Wyvern|Wyverns]] are known to fly over the region, and [[Boar|boars]], [[Bear|bears]], and even [[Owlbear|owlbears]] sometimes travel in from the forests to the east. [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Horse|Horses]] of the region are much valued (and highly expensive) for their strength, speed, and sure-footedness.
