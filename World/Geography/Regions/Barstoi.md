> **Barstoi** is one of the counties of [[Ustalav]] within the [[Soivoda]] region; it is a land of low lying foot hills and rocky fields, inhabited by people widely reputed as some of the least friendly and suspicious in all [[Ustalav]]. The county lies in the north-east of Ustalav and has [[Numeria]] on the other side of its eastern border, over the [[West Sellen River]].



## Inhabitants

> Despite the foul reputation of the land's people, Barstoi could be seen, at first sight, to be one of the best counties to live in: its fields are well managed if not particularly fertile; the people are well fed; its militia is strong and well trained. In Barstoi a man's wealth is determined by the sweat of his brow. However, Barstoi is no utopia.


## Government

> Barstoi has one of the best governments of the Ustalavic counties even though it is run by the cultured tyrant [[Aericnein Neska|Count Aericnein Neska]]. Neska drove Barstoi to civil war, the so-called War without Rivals, with its neighbouring counties in [[4689 AR]]. The count enforces a harsh policy where every crime is punishable by death; his laws are policed by persistent [[Pharasma|Pharasmin]] [[Inquisitor|inquisitors]] and by Neska's own soldiers distinguishable by their black armour.


## Economy

> Barstoi's land may be harsh but agriculture is possible, though difficult. The county also mines [[Salt|salt]]. The people are hard working and can make money so long as they keep out of trouble.
