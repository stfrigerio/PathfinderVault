A hunter attacks an [[Ankheg|ankheg]] in the Cinderlands.
> The burning plains of the [[Storval Plateau]] known as the **Cinderlands** are perhaps the most inhospitable location in all of [[Varisia]]. This wasteland of ash and sand seems an unlikely place to find any life, but it is home to a number of peoples and creatures who brave the [[Emberstorm|emberstorms]] and the heat.



## Geography

> The Cinderlands are a geographically unique region that sits atop the Storval Plateau. Nearly a desert, the region is highly [[Volcanic|volcanic]] with black blizzards known as emberstorms that race across the land, frequent brush fires in the grasslands, and deadly eruptions of poisonous gas. The badlands run roughly between the [[Wyvern Mountains]] to the west to the [[Mindspin Mountains]] to the east, and from the [[Kazaron River]] to the north to the [[Storval Rise]] in the south.


## Fauna

> The Cinderlands are home to several hardy forms of life, several of them highly dangerous in their own right. Storval [[Aurochs|aurochs]], a large and aggressive breed of the common aurochs, roam the Cinderlands in herds. [[Cinder wolf|Cinder wolves]] are common and aggressive predators, alongside burrowing [[Ankheg|ankhegs]]. [[Storm roc|Storm rocs]] nest in the peaks of the Wyvern Mountains. [[Bush tiger|Bush tigers]], a type of [[Hyena|hyena]] found only in the Cinderlands, are common scavengers, and feed on the remains that the region's predators leave behind after feeding on a kill.
> A variety of [[Giant gecko|giant gecko]] known as the [[Horned spirestalker|horned spirestalker]] is native to the Cinderlands, and is typically found among rocky crags where they wait to ambush passing prey. A rare black variant inhabits the Cinderlands' most volcanic regions, where their scales provide them with camouflage against the black volcanic rocks. These areas are also home to [[Basilisk|basilisks]], which refrain from attacking the geckos due to them preying on local [[Vermin|vermin]].


## Inhabitants


### Gargoyles

> Bands of savage [[Gargoyle|gargoyles]] have long made their home on the Storval Plateau. In the Cinderlands particularly, the ash- and brick-colored gargoyles of the Ashwing tribe soar from aerie to aerie, snatching up whatever meals they can and taking wing when the fires of the land grow too near.


### Orcs

> Raiders from the [[Hold of Belkzen]] and brutes from [[Urglin]] frequently prey upon the same animals as the native [[Shoanti]], and upon the Shoanti themselves. Fearful of the deadly land, they rarely linger for long, yet it's not uncommon to find the charred remains of orcs who were unable to outrun an emberstorm.


### Shoanti

> The Shoanti tribes of the [[Sklar-Quah]], [[Lyrune-Quah]], and [[Skoan-Quah]] wander the Cinderlands, preying upon the lands' deadly predators and following migrating [[Aurochs|aurochs]]. The flames of the land have long held a place in the faith and traditions of these warlike [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]], most noticeably in the fearless charges of the burn riders and in the rite of passage all quah members must face: the Burn Run.


### Varisians

> The wandering cousins of the Shoanti occasionally make their way through the Cinderlands, always either on their way somewhere else or just to say they've been there.
