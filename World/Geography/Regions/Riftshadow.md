> **Riftshadow** is a region of the [[Sarkoris Scar]] that follows the flow of the [[Sarkora River|Sarkora]] and [[West Sarkora River|West Sarkora Rivers]] (except for where the Sarkora flows through [[Frostmire Fen]], which is considered part of [[Frostmire]]).


## History

> Before the opening of the [[Worldwound]] in [[4706 AR]], the Sarkora River was a heavily traveled main trade route in the realm of [[Sarkoris]]. It still runs along the [[Northmounds]] plateau's southern and western cliffs, forming what was once the most heavily populated region of Sarkoris. The formerly heavily traveled waterway passed by the cities of [[Storasta]], [[Raliscrad]], and [[Undarin]], along with dozens of smaller towns and villages.
> During the century the region was occupied by countless [[Demon|demons]], Riftshadow was a nightmare of ruins and abyssal horrors. The abandoned city of Storasta is located at the southern edge of the region, while Undarin, the city once controlled [[Half-fiend|half-fiend]] [[Witch|witch]] [[Areelu Vorlesh]], is located at the northern edge. Countless [[Demon|demons]] walked Riftshadow's riverside roads, plied the tainted waters of the Sarkora River on [[Dread Barge|demonic barges]], and flew in the skies above.
