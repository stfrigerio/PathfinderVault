> The **Windswept Wastes** is the name given to the central deserts and western steppes of the continent of [[Casmaron]]. It is nominally part of the [[Empire of Kelesh]], but the inhabitants keep their own tribal customs and traditions and are largely left to their own devices by the Padishah Emperor.



## Inhabitants

> The region's inhabitants are mainly [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshites]], though culturally quite different from those living in the heartland of Kelesh to the south. The bestial [[Undead|undead]] known as [[Namorrodor|namorrodors]] are known to haunt the parts of the Windswept Wastes that are coterminous with the [[Shadow Plane]].


### Religion

> The inhabitants honour [[Sarenrae]] and the other gods of the Empire of Kelish, but they also have their own legend which dates from the days of [[Ninshabur]]. It tells of a human hero called [[Namzaruum]] who will return one day to lead his descendants to victory against their enemies. Agents of Kelesh have for centuries scoured the Wastes for rumors of his return. In the name of maintaining order, they have killed anyone who might fit the mold of the cultural hero.
