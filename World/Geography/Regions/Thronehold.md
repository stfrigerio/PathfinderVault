> **Thronehold** is the [[Irrisen]] province that is home to the capital of [[Whitethrone]] and its current ruler, [[Elvanna|Queen Elvanna]]. Even though each of the nation's provinces is geared to supplying the capital with all of its needs, this is especially true for Thronehold; each of its settlements serve only to funnel food, goods, and slaves to Whitethrone.


## Settlements

> All of the province's settlements are located on the water: either on the shores of [[Glacier Lake]], or on one of its rivers.
