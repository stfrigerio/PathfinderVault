> The **Gembasket** spans an area in the [[Barrier Wall]] mountains approximately a mile in diameter, across razored peaks, unexpected drops, rocky ground, and impassable rises. Within this area, natural resources lie thick and abundant. Nodes of [[Gemstone|gemstones]], precious [[Metal|metals]], and veins of minerals run the rocky walls. A narrow and dangerous path winds up through the mountains to the Gembasket, and only experienced travelers can follow the path.
