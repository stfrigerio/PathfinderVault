> The frontier region known as **Dunsward** on the easternmost side of the [[Stolen Lands]] borders the steppes of [[Casmaron]], and the ancient ruins of [[Iobaria]].
> Dunsward is characterized by low, grassy plains, and its most common inhabitants are proud and suspicious [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] of the Nomen centaur tribe. They avoid what are traditionally considered [[Human|human]] lands, adhering to some unwritten and age-old truce between themselves and the humans, but should their plains feel the imprint of human boot, they are quick to anger and violence.
> The [[Brevoy|Brevic]] city of [[Restov]] lies north of Dunsward.
