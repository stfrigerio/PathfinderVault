*This article considers the Garundi mainland region of the Shackles. For the article about the capital city of the Shackles, please see **[[Port Peril]]**.*
> The **mainland region** of the [[Shackles]] is a large headland that juts out from western [[Garund]] into the [[Fever Sea]], directly east of the archipelago. Its hinterland is dominated by the [[Terwa Uplands]], even though its coastal regions are generally not mountainous It is also the location of the capital of the Shackles, [[Port Peril]], situated on its northern coast. The mainland's shores are rocky, with rough seas and few safe harbours, making the area dangerous for shipping. The mainland's southern coast is home to numerous snakes and is known as the [[Slithering Coast]].


## Settlements

> The [[Shackles Pirates]] have established four ports on this unforgiving shore, although the capital, Port Peril, is by far the largest. The region is also the site of the Shackles' only inland settlement, the trading post of [[Neruma]]. Other towns include [[Colvaas Gibbet]], [[Oyster Cay]], and [[Parley Point]].
