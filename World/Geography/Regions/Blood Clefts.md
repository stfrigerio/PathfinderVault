> The dead region called the **Blood Clefts** is the home, for now, of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Areshkagal]]. Here, she plots and raises armies to assault her half-sister, [[Aldinach]], who is also a daughter of [[Lamashtu]].



## History

> This formerly unknown realm has now become relatively important in [[Abyss|Abyssal]] politics, since Areshkagal, demon lord of [[Portal|portals]] and riddles, fled there in exile. It now serves as a staging ground for weak but spirited attacks on Aldinach and her forces, who stole the neighbouring [[Sea of Whispering Sands]] from her sister. Areshkagal's armies were decimated by the surprise coup, and Areshkagal does not take the time to recuperate her losses.


## Denizens

> Areshkagal has relatively few followers, so there are only a few of the greater [[Demon|demons]] in her service. She does have [[Half-demon|half-demon]] and [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] [[Sphinx|sphinxes]], due to her favored form of a six-legged sphinx, and of course the [[Chaotic evil|chaotic evil]] [[Soul|souls]] she has claimed also are found in the Blood Clefts.


## Terrain

> The Blood Clefts are a region of crimson rock and earth, cut with rivers of seeping blood, where some say no [[Plant|plants]] grow; others claim that the stunted, scraggly plant life craves the blood of the living, though it generally subsists on the available "groundblood." The landscape is harsh, with sheer cliffs, deep-cut ravines, jagged rocks, and no surface water—only blood—to be found, as demons do not need to drink.
