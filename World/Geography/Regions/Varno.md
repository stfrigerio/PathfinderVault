> The county of **Varno** lies in the far south-east of the country of [[Ustalav]] and so it borders foreign nations: to its east lies the technological country of [[Numeria]] and the chaotic [[River Kingdoms]]; to its south is the Theocracy of [[Razmiran]]. To Varno's west is the county of [[Versex]]; while to the north lies the county of [[Barstoi]] and [[The Furrows|the Furrows]]. Varno  is a county within the [[Soivoda]] region.


## Geography

> Varno is filled with dense forests and deep lakes. While it should be a fertile haven, the county is afflicted by fickle, some would say unnatural, weather, with seasons of plenty followed by years of drought and famine. As a result, the people of Varno are some of the most pious in all Ustalav, quick to proclaim their undying faith to [[Desna]], or fickle [[Gozreh]], as soon as the weather turns against them. Many are sadly willing to buy into the lies of any passing evangelist con man or soothsayer. The harsh conditions tend to turn neighbour against neighbour, and during times of famine, Varno's inhabitants are some of the most suspicious in the country. The harsh conditions are further exacerbated by the hands-off style of Varno's ruler, [[Risotmaur Tiriac|Conte Risotmaur Tiriac]], who keeps himself distant from his people.
