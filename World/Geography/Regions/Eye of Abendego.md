 The [[Inner Sea region]], with the Eye of Abendego visible off the western coast of [[Garund]] near the [[Sodden Lands]].
> The **Eye of Abendego** (pronounced ah-BEN-deh-go) is a vicious, permanent hurricane located in the southern [[Arcadian Ocean]] off the western coast of the continent of [[Garund]] (between [[Mediogalti]] and the [[Sodden Lands]] and north of the [[Shackles]]).



## History

> The Eye appeared in [[4606 AR]] in what was then known as the Abendego Gulf. Although the exact cause of its appearance is unknown, it came into being after the three weeks of tempest following the death of [[Aroden]], and remains as the greatest physical evidence of the event. The Eye and the storms it spawned brought doom upon the countries of [[Lirgen]] and [[Yamasa]], creating the [[Sodden Lands]]. The hurricane also halted the colonization of [[Sargava]].


## Description


 
>The intensity of the Eye is variable. At its weakest it can tear the sails off the biggest ships. At its strongest, the wind alone can blow a large vessel into splinters. The Eye periodically spawns smaller storms that travel up and down the Garundi coast, bringing torrential rain and hurricane-speed winds to outlying regions. It has been used to great effect by the pirate lords of the Shackles, who hide their illegal activities behind it, and by the inhabitants of Mediogalti Island, who use the storm as part of their defenses.
> Magical [[Magic/Divination|divinations]] focused on the center of the Eye observed a large eye of calm whose waters are choked with debris. Many expeditions fail due to the winds, and the few that persist encounter [[Air elemental|air elementals]], [[Undead|undead]], and sea monsters.


## Inhabitants

> Strong winds and high seas are not the only dangers of the Eye of Abendego. Sailors who have dared the outer rims of the hurricane tell tales of bloodthirsty [[Adaro|adaro]], [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]] ships, aquatic undead, unknown sea monsters, and powerful [[Air elemental|air elementals]].


## Free Captains' Regatta

***Main article: [[Free Captains' Regatta|Free Captains Regatta]]***
> The [[Free Captains' Regatta|Free Captains Regatta]] is an annual race around the outskirts of the Eye of Abendego that [[Pirate|pirate]] captains enter in the hope of increasing their prestige and standing among the other captains of the Shackles.


## In Religion

> A splinter cult of [[Gozreh]] known as the [[Storm Kindlers]] believed that the Eye was a manifestation of their [[Deity|deity]], while the [[Boggard|boggards]] of the Sodden Lands believe it is connected to their patron deity, [[Rovagug]].
