> The desert region of [[Osirion]] to the south-east of [[Sothis]] is known as the **Underdunes**, and is one of the country's most impressive physical features. It takes its name from the immense sandy trenches carved by the passage of countless [[Elemental|elementals]] through the desert. The trenches can provide travellers with welcome shade, but there remains the ever-present risk of a sand slide.
