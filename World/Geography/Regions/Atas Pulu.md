> **Atas Pulu** is the northernmost region of islands that make up [[Minata]], the so called "Wandering Isles". These islands are the most integrated with the rest of [[Tian Xia]] as they are home to a number of small, petty kingdoms that trade heavily with the mainland. The largest islands within Atas Pulu are the [[Shibobeka Islands|Shibobekas]]: a series of islands that were once all part of the enormous [[Mount Shibotai]] before its eruption during the [[Age of Ashes]]. These islands are exceptionally fertile and are inhabited by many tribes of [[Wayang|wayangs]]. The wayang city of [[Inahiyi]] lies at the heart of the islands. The floating [[Pirate|pirate]] city of [[Zo Piaobo]] also oftens drifts between the islands of Atas Pulu.
