> The **Archduchy of Hellcoast** is one of six [[Archduchies of Cheliax]].



## Geography

> The Archduchy of Hellcoast encompasses much of the western coastline of [[Cheliax]], from the mouth of the [[Maiestas River]] in the south to the [[Menador Gap|gap]] between the [[Menador Mountains]] and [[Ravounel Forest]].


## Government

> Hellcoast is one of two Chelish archduchies, along with the [[Archduchy of Ravounel]], to lack an [[Archduke Chelish title|archduke]]. It was previously ruled by [[House Davian]] until the [[Battle of a Hundred Kings]] in [[4639 AR]], and rule has not been granted to another family since.
> The archduchy is nominally governed by [[Marcellus Thurivan|Paraduke Marcellus Thurivan]], who was appointed by [[House Thrune]]. However, due to ongoing unrest in the previous capital of [[Pezzack]], the region is managed from [[Belde]], a town in the far western [[Archduchy of the Heartlands|Heartlands]].
