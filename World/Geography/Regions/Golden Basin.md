> The **Golden Basin** is one of the central regions of the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]]. One of the most beautiful regions, it is also home to the Vudran capital city, [[Indapatta]]. Many [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapadas]] rule over the lands of the Golden Basin, competing to build magnificent palaces, libraries, temples, and monuments, but none can compete with the sublime splendour of Indapatta. Beyond the city walls, the area known as [[Sacred Soil]] is home to some of the most productive fields, orchards, and rice paddies. [[Hemanth|Rajah Hemanth]] rules over one of these breadbasket mahajanapadas.
> The [[Kalyan River]] bisects the Golden Basin region, flowing from [[Johar Mountains]] to the north its head is the mountain [[Adarparbat]], which is supposedly held sacred by the [[Deity|goddess]] [[Sarenrae]]. The Kalyan River gathers tiny flecks of [[Gold|gold]] from its riverbanks and when it reaches [[Sona Lake]] it imparts a [[Magic|magical]] golden glow when the light strikes the lake just right. At the end of the Kalyan River, a colossal statue known as [[Devi|The Devi]] stands over two hundred feet tall. The statue depicts the [[Psychic|psychic]] [[Vanitapati]] and stands where she used her potent psychic abilities to overcome the [[Spawn of Rovagug]] known as [[Kothogaz]]. The Devi has become a site of holy pilgrimage and psychic power. To the north, almost forgotten, lies the village of [[Udayasankar]]. Udayasankar is significant as it sits near a small cave that is home to the [[Stone Egg of Jayalakshmi]], a powerful [[Artifact|artifact]] that during the ancient [[Age of Legend]] first opened the minds of the [[Human|humans]] who studied it.
