## Modern Counties of Ustalav

> Modern Ustalav is split into thirteen distinct regions called **counties**. While each county is still subservient to the monarch of [[Ustalav]], [[Aduard Ordranti III|Prince Aduard Ordranti III]], the rulers of the individual counties are allowed a lot of independence. The counties can be split into three types:

> - the [[Soivoda]] encompassing the entire expanse of eastern Ustalav: they are still run by the noble families appointed millennia ago when Ustalav was first divided;
> - the [[Palatinates]] in the north-west third of the country: they have thrown off the rule of their hereditary noble lords and are now governed by councils of prominent citizens;
> - the south-western wasteland of [[Virlych]].
> A full list of all the counties can be found below:

### Virlych

> *Full article: [[Virlych]]*

Virlych is the name given to the lifeless, haunted wasteland that surrounds the [[Whispering Tyrant|Whispering Tyrants]] prison of [[Gallowspire]]. It is not technically a county as it has no government, or for that matter living citizens; it is the shattered remains of two former provinces: [[Virholt]] and [[Grodlych]]. These were ravaged during the reign of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] nearly a millennia ago and have never recovered.

## Historical Counties of Ustalav

> [[Kaldemov|King Kaldemov]], facing the threat of a civil war among Ustalav's noble families, split his nation into sixteen separate counties in [[2862 AR]].  Each of the major noble families were given nearly complete autonomy within their territories, but each also owed allegiance to the crown.  This system of government survived until the nation's conquest by the Whispering Tyrant in [[3203 AR]].


### The Sixteen Original Counties

> The sixteen original counties into which King Kaldemov split his country are assumed to be: Amaans, Ardeal, Barstoi, Caliphas, Grodlych, Janoyt, Lozeri, Odranto, Sinaria, Tamrivena, Ulcazar, Varno, Versex, Vieland, Virholt, and one other whose name is currently lost to time.
> Here is a list of the four counties that no longer exist in their original county form.


### Grodlych

> *Full article: [[Grodlych]]*

Grodlych was one of the two counties of Ustalav most devastated by the baleful influence of the reborn Whispering Tyrant and the devastation of the [[Shining Crusade]] that was launched to overthrow the [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|lich]]. After the defeat of the Tyrant it was combined with its equally desolate neighbour, Virholt *(q.v.)*, to form the new territory of Virlych.

### Janoyt

> *Full article: [[Janoyt]]*

Janoyt was once a meagrely populated county of Ustalav bordered by [[Avalon Bay]] and the county of Varno. At the refounding of Ustalav, after the defeat of the Whispering Tyrant, the county was predominantly controlled by the [[Melcat|Arch-Duchy of Melcat]] and the new rulers of Ustalav granted the county to the Archduke's total control. Eventually, the ex-county became the theocracy of [[Razmiran]], as it remains today.

### Tamrivena

> *Full article: [[Tamrivena]]*

Tamrivena was the name of the modern day county of Canterwall before it joined the Palatinates: Tamrivena changed its name to Canterwall at that time. Tamrivena today is the name of the county town of Canterwall.

### Virholt

> *Full article: [[Virholt]]*

Virholt was one of the original counties into which King Kaldemov divided Ustalav in 2862 AR; it was sadly also one of the first conquests of the reborn Whispering Tyrant in 3203 AR.  During the centuries of his unnatural reign, it became a lifeless wilderness where no living thing could thrive.  This blight was not lifted with the Whispering Tyrant's defeat in [[38' AR]], and remains to the present day.  The victors of the Shining Crusade combined Virholt with its equally desolate neighbour, Grodlych *(q.v.)*, naming the territory Virlych.
