> **Bag Island** is one of the major islands of the [[Shackles]]. It is west of [[Dahak's Teeth|Dahaks Teeth]] and north of [[Motaku Isle]].
> The ruler of Bag Island is the [[Pirate lord|pirate lord]] [[Jolis Raffles]], who offers freed [[Slave|slaves]] from the slave [[Ship|ships]] of [[Cheliax]] the chance to settle on his island.
> Bag Island is committed to crushing the slave trade and is in a dire conflict with the much-hated [[Bedu Hanji]] and [[Rampore Isles]] to Bag Island's north. The [[Rakshasa|rakshasa]]-led Rampore Isles are a major slave trade center, and the slaver-hating halflings of Bag Island celebrate every capture of a Rampore slave ship. Not a week goes by without a Bag Island vessel encountering a ship flying the blood-red flag of Rampore. Bag Island crews fight to the death, as captured sailors are crucified on the southern shore of Rampore's largest island. The coast has been named the [[Halfling Coast]] by Hanji himself.


## Geography

> The south of Bag Island is grassy plains, rolling hills, and sandy shores but the north of the island is craggy and dotted with thick patches of rainforest. The lazy river [[Libera River|Libera]] feeds several hot marshy areas that are home to [[Venom|venomous]] [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]], oversized insects, and giant amphibians. It is said that [[Manticore|manticores]] and even a [[Black dragon|black dragon]] lair in the marshes.
