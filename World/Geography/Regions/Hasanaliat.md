> **Hasanaliat** is a region of forested hills on the [[Crown of the World]], home to the largest population of [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] on the continent. Unlike most of their folk, the Erutaki of Hasanaliat live in small scattered villages located along the area's many fertile lakes and rivers. The [[Path of Aganhei]] runs through Hasanaliat, one of the safer stretches of its length.
> The region of Hasanaliat is sheltered by the Gaarjuk Hills to the east and the western [[Rimethirst Mountains]] to the south. Its many lakes and rivers are drained by the great Taraska River.
> Though Hasanaliat has no central government, villages frequently consult with each other and cooperate. There is no capital, but the largest town, [[Aaminiut]], has a large permanent populace. The Erutaki trade with the [[Ulfen]] whalers of [[Almhult]], who have a small colony in Hasanaliat.
