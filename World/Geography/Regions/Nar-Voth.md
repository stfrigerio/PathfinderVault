> **Nar-Voth** (pronounced nar-VOTH) is the uppermost region of the [[Darklands]], loosely defined as descending from the surface of [[Golarion]] to a depth of about 2,000 feet. This region consists of countless interconnected cave networks, some of which are linked to one another through lengthy, twisting passages. While the caverns are immense and span great distances, they do not span the length of entire continents. For a cave system to be considered part of Nar-Voth, there must be a passage leading down to [[Sekamina]], where such vast systems can be found. When surface-dwelling races talk about the Darklands, they are generally referring to Nar-Voth, as this is the only section most of them have visited, and the region from which most of the Darklands races seen on the surface originate.



## History


### Quest for Sky

> The massive earthquakes that shook the surface of Golarion after [[Earthfall]] also caused tremendous upheaval in Nar-Voth. Massive cave systems collapsed, many of them inhabited by [[Orc|orcs]] and [[Dwarf|dwarves]], two races that had lived there since time immemorial. The dwarves saw these earthquakes as a sign from their [[Deity|god]] [[Torag]], and initiated a massive migration towards the surface known as the [[Quest for Sky]]. Over the course of the centuries, the stout folk continued their war with the orcs, driving the bestial creatures ahead of them until the great majority no longer dwelled in Nar-Voth.


### Those left behind

> Some of the dwarven brethren chose to stay behind in their great underground cities, refusing to give up their ancestral homelands; the descendants of these dwarves became the [[Duergar|duergar]] over the following millennia. After most of the tribes of orcs and dwarves had abandoned their ancient caverns, many of the surface's wilder inhabitants migrated down to fill them; they included the [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]], the [[Vegepygmy|vegepygmies]], and the [[Dark fey|dark fey]]. Some [[Human|humans]] did the same, fleeing the devastation on the surface. Exposure to strange substances and pacts with dark powers eventually transformed them into entirely distinct races, including the [[Mongrelman|mongrelmen]], [[Morlock|morlocks]], and the [[Dark folk|dark folk]].
> The [[Dero|dero]] had always existed in Nar-Voth, but also took advantage of the power vacuum left by the absence of the dwarves and orcs, seizing much of the former's territories.


## Inhabitants

> Many creatures that dwell in Nar-Voth are relatively isolated and tribal, and are generally found in small groups. However, a number of 'civilized' races such as the duergar, mongrelmen, troglodytes, vegepygmies, and dero occupy certain systems in large numbers. These races occasionally ascend to the surface to raid, which is why most of Nar-Voth's larger cities are located beneath or near major surface population centers. Two examples include the duergar city of [[Fellstrok]] near the orc capital of [[Urgir]], and the dero enclave of [[Corgunbier]], located beneath the [[Taldor|Taldan]] port of [[Cassomir]]. There are also a fair amount of species found both in Nar-Voth and on the surface, such as dwarves, orcs, [[Goblin|goblins]], and [[Troll|trolls]].


### Derro

> These insane, blue-skinned [[Humanoid|humanoids]] usually dwell under major surface cities, and conduct nightly raids into them in search of victims for their bizarre and sadistic experiments.


### Duergar

> A sub-race of dwarves, twisted by millennia of hardship and toil, the duergar are servants to the [[Evil|evil]] dwarven [[Deity|deity]] [[Droskar]]. Claiming to have been abandoned by their lesser cousins during the Quest for Sky, they are now among the most ardent [[Slavery|slavers]] in Nar-Voth.


### Troglodytes

> These reptilian inhabitants of Nar-Voth are among the Darklands' layer most numerous. Due to their love of infighting and lack of social cohesion, they have never presented a large threat to the other local races, and generally work as mercenaries for them.


### Vegepygmies

> Vegepygmies are [[Plant|plant]]-like humanoids who were created relatively recently by the sporecrafters of the [[Drow|drow]] [[House Udrinor]]. They quickly outgrew their master's control during a short-lived war known as the Stalking Death, and fled Sekamina for the relatively less-dangerous caverns of Nar-Voth.


## Locations

> Scattered amongst the great sprawling cave complexes are a number of systems that function as population centers for some of the inhabitants of Nar-Voth. In particular, the duergar occupy a number of abandoned pre-existing dwarven cities.
