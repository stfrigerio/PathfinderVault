> The northeastern half of [[Varisia]] is a landscape starkly contrasted to the rest of the region. Atop the thousand-foot-high [[Storval Rise]] rests the arid and desolate Storval Plateau. Much less populated and hospitable than the lush, fertile lowlands to the south and west, the Storval Plateau nonetheless provides a home to several tribes of nomadic [[Shoanti]], as well as a large population of [[Giant|giants]] and varying wildlife. The hellish [[Cinderlands]] are perhaps the most well-known of the Plateau's features, but it contains a number of other dangers and mysteries including the [[Storval Deep]], [[Lake Skotha]], [[Guiltspur]] and the [[Mobhad Leigh]]. The only permanent settlements of note in the entirety of the Plateau are the [[Orc|orc]] city of [[Urglin]], located in the northern reaches of the Cinderlands; and [[Kaer Maga]], which sits precariously on the edge of the Storval Rise at the [[Yondabakari River]].



## Inhabitants


### Cities

> - [[Kaer Maga]]
> - [[Urglin]]

### Giants

> Even though the Storval Plateau is home to countless species, its true masters are its giant inhabitants who are descended from the [[Slavery|slave workers]] of ancient [[Thassilon]]. They make their home in the crags and mountaintops of the region and make frequent raids on the softer settlements of the south.


### Shoanti

> The Plateau is home to some of the tribes of the Shoanti people who eke out a living hunting [[Aurochs|aurochs]] on the sparse grasslands.


### Namorrodor

> The bestial [[Undead|undead]] known as [[Namorrodor|namorrodors]] are known to hunt around some of the river gorges that criss-cross the Storval Plateau where the [[Material Plane]] is coterminous with the [[Shadow Plane]].
