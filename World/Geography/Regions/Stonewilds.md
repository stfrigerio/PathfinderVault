> The **Stonewilds** is the north-easternmost of the five regions of the [[Sarkoris Scar]]. It is bordered to the south by the [[Wounded Lands]] and to the west by [[Frostmire]]. Before the opening of the Worldwound, the Stonewilds were a vast, evergreen forest called the **Forest of Stones** sacred to the [[Green Faith]] as that ideology's birthplace and repository for its most sacred texts.
