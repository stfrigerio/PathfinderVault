> The **Flume Warrens** are a volcanic region of [[Sekamina]], the middle layer of the [[Darklands]]. It is located beneath [[Varisia]]'s [[Cinderlands]], and is constantly filled with smoke and gas. Volcanic activity from below has carried deposits of gold and gems close to the surface here.

> The Flume Warrens are inhabited by warring tribes of [[Azer|azer]] and [[Salamander|salamanders]]. Both sides are seeking to gain the aid of the [[Fire giant|fire giants]] of the [[Mindspin Mountains]], which the giants exploit for their own benefit. There are also [[Thoqqua|thoqqua]] and [[Magmin|magmin]] living here.
