The **Halfling Coast** is a coast on the southern shoreline of the largest of the [[Rampore Isles]] in the [[Shackles]]. The cruel [[Rakshasa|rakshasa]] [[Bedu Hanji]], who rules the Rampore Isles, has maliciously named the coast "Halfling Coast" because he used to crucify captured sailors from [[Bag Island]] ships there.
