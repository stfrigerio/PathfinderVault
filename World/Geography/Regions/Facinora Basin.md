> The **Facinora Basin** is a vast crater in the northern hemisphere of [[Eox]], so large that it qualifies Eox as the only non-spherical [[Planet|planet]] in [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Solar system|solar system]].



## History

> The Facinora Basin was created in the same catastrophe that destroyed Eox's ecosystem, one far bigger than Golarion's [[Earthfall]]. Millions of cubic metres of rock were torn from the planet's surface and vaporised or launched into space, leaving behind a vast wound oozing with igneous rocks from Eox's core that surged up. Since then, [[Gravity|gravity]] and erosion have barely erased this evidence of Eox's death throes.


## Geography

> The Facinora Basin is surrounded by a mountain range called the Fringe, which is twice as tall on the crater side and precipitously drops down to the floor. The ground of the crater is filled with obsidian, ashen boulders, and the sludgy remnants of old seas, as well as damaged [[Magnetic field|magnetic fields]] and [[Ley line|ley lines]], ball lightning, strange flames, and [[Magic|magical]] [[Transmutation|transmutation]] storms. Geysers and [[Volcano|volcanoes]] constantly erupt, destroying life and providing life-giving chemicals at the same time.


## Inhabitants

> Hungry [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]], killed by the cataclysm and cut off from the [[River of Souls]] by the violence of their deaths, roam the Facinora Basin in gibbering packs. This is the place where communication with them is easiest, but even the [[Bone sage|bone sages]] usually avoid doing that. Wildlife in the Facinora Basin includes glass serpents and strange creatures bred by the [[Radiation|radiation]] like semi-intelligent grubs and [[Ellicoth|ellicoths]].
> Despite its sheer danger, the Facinora Basin still sees visitors. Some of them seek the bizarre life forms adapted to Eox's environment, others study the fallout of the calamity or search for ancient relics, and still others want nothing more than power, but all tread carefully.
