> The **Blood Plains** are a region of the [[Hold of Belkzen]] bordered roughly by the [[Kodar Mountains]] to the north, the [[Mindspin Mountains]] in the south, and the [[Flood Road]] to the east. The region is characterized by near-constant warfare between the [[Orc|orcs]] of Belkzen and the [[Shoanti]] of eastern [[Varisia]] (particularly the [[Lyrune-Quah]] and [[Sklar-Quah]] tribes).


## Places of Interest

> The most notable places in the Blood Plains include two old battlegrounds, the [[Battle of Screaming Tree]] and the [[Battle of the Shadefields]], the forbidding castle known as [[Scarwall]], the mystical [[Seraph's Ladder|Seraphs Ladder]], and the mountain-sized sculpture called the [[Sleeper]]. Two orc settlements are also located here: the anarchic [[Blisterwell]], and the [[Foundry]], the source of much of Belkzen's arms and armor.


## Flora and Fauna

> The plains of western Belkzen are an arid wasteland with little surface water. [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|Wild dogs]] are common, as are [[Belkzen puma|Belkzen pumas]], and the occasional [[Bulette|bulette]].
