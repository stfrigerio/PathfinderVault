> The **Tashen Yakuta** is an ice shelf extending southward from the [[Crown of the World]], covering much of the [[Shining Sea]] and the [[Ivory Sea]]. In the summer, it extends 10 to 20 miles from the shore, but stretches out much further during the cold arctic winter. The shelf is over 2,000 feet thick in some points. The mouth of the Espinar River marks the end of the Tashen Yakuta as it stretches toward [[Avistan]].
> The [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] of [[Yumyzyl]] make their homes against the Tashen Yakuta's margins.
