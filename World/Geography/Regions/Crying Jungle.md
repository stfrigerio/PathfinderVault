> The region of [[Vudra]] known as the **Crying Jungle** is one of the densest, most verdant jungles on the entire [[Continent|continent]] of [[Casmaron]]. The waters of the [[Baghshahi River]] that flow down from the [[Johar Mountains]]—whose peaks form the region's western border—and eventually empty into the [[Embaral Ocean]] are the lifeblood of the Crying Jungle. The jungle itself is dense, its canopy almost impenetrable but life blooms within with countless species of [[Animal|animals]], insects and [[Plant|plants]] dwelling within. The Crying Jungle is also home to a huge variety of [[Humanoid|humanoids]] from the [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]] [[Human|humans]] and [[Half-elf|half-elves]] to [[Ysoki|ratfolk]], ratajins, [[Vanara|vanaras]], [[Vishkanya|vishkanyas]], and even the nefarious [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]]. Some of the [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapadas]] of the region are even openly ruled by [[Naga|nagas]] and [[Rakshasa|rakshasas]].
> The capital city of the Crying Jungle region is [[Jayat-Von]], located pretty much at the centre of the jungle.
> The mahajanapada of [[Sikari]] sits in one of the most primal corners of the Crying Jungle and has had issues with its settlements being overrun with [[Sikari macaque swarm|Sikari macaques]], vast swarms of rabid [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Monkey|monkeys]]. The so-called "lost" mahajanapada of [[Khoyadesh]] lies somewhere within the northern reaches of the region. Many mahajanapadas encircle [[Jansagar Lake]] in the south of the province, which is home to the [[Deity|goddess]] [[Janpati]]. Her blessings means that any animal that drinks from Jansagar Lake gains sapience and the neighbouring mahajanapada of [[Janvari]] consists of thousands of these awakened creatures ruled by a sentient [[Panther|panther]] raja named [[Tendula]]. The Crying Jungle is also the centre of worship for the righteous monkey god [[Topimanu]].
