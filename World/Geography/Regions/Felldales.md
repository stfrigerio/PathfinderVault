> The **Felldales** is a large plain in western [[Numeria]] scored by hundreds of artificial valleys created thousands of years ago by the impacts of parts of the [[Divinity|space-faring vessel]] that broke apart during the [[Rain of Stars]]. The Felldales is also one of the four regions of Numeria.


## Geography

> This broad area is marred by hundreds of valleys created during the Rain of Stars, although much of the damage done to the land has been erased through the ages. Locals living in secluded villages speak of strange monoliths, deposits of [[Skymetal|skymetal]], strange waves of color capable of consuming passers-by, and bizarre alien life forms that stalk the land.


## History

> In one recent incident, an [[Annihilator|annihilator]] [[Robot|robot]] shaped like a huge metallic [[Scorpion|scorpion]] kidnapped several people in [[4709 AR]] before returning to its lair somewhere in the Felldales.


> [[Paizo]] published a major chapter considering the Felldales in *[[Numeria Land of Fallen Stars]]*.
