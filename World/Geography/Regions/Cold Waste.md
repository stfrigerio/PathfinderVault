> The **Cold Waste** is the northernmost region of [[Leng]], past the Watchers in the Waste, where the mountain walls of the plateau converge towards [[Kadath]]. It is a cold desert where daylight is unknown. In this area, distances are uncertain: travellers who seek to come to Kadath might need to spend any amount of time from a day to many years to pass through the Cold Waste.
