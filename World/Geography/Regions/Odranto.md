> The [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of **Odranto** lies in the far north of the country within the [[Soivoda]] region.



## History

> Odranto has always stood as a barrier against the vicious northern [[Kellid human ethnicity|Kellid]] nations of [[Numeria]] and [[Sarkoris]] (before the latter's fall at the beginning of the [[Age of Lost Omens]]). The Ustalavs had forced these [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarian]] hordes north of the [[Moutray River]] in ages past and, since then, the counts of Odranto have been responsible for keeping them there.


## Inhabitants

> Odranto is home to a particularly vile tribe of [[Xulgath|xulgaths]] known as the Marshworth Clutch. Unlike most tribes, they are devoted to [[Zura]] (instead of the xulgath's usual [[Demon|demonic]] patron [[Zevgavizeb]]) and indulge in foul [[Vampire|vampiric]] rites that grant them unusual, unnatural abilities.


## Government

> [[Conwrest Muralt|Count Conwrest Muralt]] is the latest in the line of counts of Odranto.


## Castles and Fortifications

> The history of ancient conflict and rule by the powerful counts of Odranto has led to the land being dotted with many castles from a variety of time periods and in a myriad of different architectural styles. Some of these castles are still inhabited, though some are decidedly not and are guarded for fear of what lies inside. The legends and fireside tales of Odranto are littered with stories of haunted castles and forlorn fortresses, such as [[House Beumhal]], the [[Ground of Lost Tears]] and the infamous [[Castle Kronquist]].
