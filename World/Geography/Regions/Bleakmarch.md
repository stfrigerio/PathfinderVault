> **Bleakmarch** is the north-westernmost province of the bleak country of [[Irrisen]]. Its capital is the towering city of [[Algidheart]] on the [[Rimeflow River]], and it is ruled by [[Weneschia Elvanna|Duchess Weneschia Elvanna]].
> Bleakmarch is framed by the [[Iceflow River]] to the west, Rimeflow River to the south, [[Glacier Lake]] to the east, and the [[Winterwall Glacier]] to the north. All settlements in the province are located on one of these waterways, and the interior is a snowy wilderness of rolling plains with patches of conifers and leafless trees. Except for the occasional peasants engaging in fur trapping or hunting, [[Humanoid|humanoids]] otherwise leave the Bleakmarch's interior to the beasts warped by the centuries long supernatural winter. Hungry [[Frost giant|frost giants]] traveling alone or in small groups often attack town folk, and occasionally demand tribute to leave a settlement intact.
