> The **Footprints of Rovagug** is one of [[Osirion]]'s six regions, a region of sandless desert badlands in the country's south-west, bordered by the [[Scarab River]] in its north and the [[Parched Dunes]] in its west. The country's only two [[Volcano|volcanoes]], [[Sokar's Boil|Sokars Boil]] and [[Asuulek's Mouth|Asuuleks Mouth]], are in this region; and Osirian nobles sometimes travel here to partake of the healthy spring waters, like those at [[Djeneg]]. In the past, the region produced copper, [[Silver|silver]], [[Iron|iron]], tuff, and pumice; however, most mines are long-since played-out.



## Geography

> The region is one of ash, clay, and dirt: a sandless desert filled with hardened "three-toed" lava flow features—the Footprints of Rovagug, from which the region's name originates—across its face and menaced by two volcanoes, one active and the other long quiescent. Breaking the monotony of destruction and despair, a number of hot springs well up throughout the landscape, though most are [[Poison|poisonous]].
> Flowing water does exist in the region, however, in the form of the [[Scarab River]], which runs west to the [[Junira]] and marks the region's northernmost border with the [[Glazen Sheet|Glazen Sheets]], that are part of the [[Osirian Desert]] region of the country. The river's source is a group of springs located high among hills and it provides sustenance to [[Beetle|beetles]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]] with razor-sharp feathers, the [[Stymphalides|stymphalides]].


## Locations


### Footprints of Rovagug

![[Rovagug_holy_symbol.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Many cults of Rovagug flourish in the region.
> The **Footprints of Rovagug** are also a hardened lava flow feature that gives the region its name. The "Footprints" are distributed throughout the region, each having an essentially similar shape appearing like a gigantic three-toed [[Animal|animal]]'s foot. The prints, however, do not lead in a particular path, seldom point in the same direction, and are spaced at odd distances. Cultists of [[Rovagug]] believe that a sacred monster created the footprints by stomping with such strength that lava was released due to the pressure of the pressing feet; however, most people in Osirion believe they are merely hardened lava flows. A number of the footprints are menaced by violent hermits and others have cultists of Rovagug for caretakers. For example, at the site of six adjacent footprints, the Worldbreaker's Stride, a small cult of [[Human|humans]], [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]], and partially-tamed [[Giant scorpion|giant scorpions]] assaults non-believers.


### Other locations

> The region also has a number of sites, other than the physical "Footprints" of [[Rovagug]]. These sites include temples and tombs built by long-dead [[Pharaoh|pharaohs]] in the [[Barrier Wall]]. Some of those sites were destroyed by earthquakes or volcanoes, but others remain. Mines like the [[Aphet Mines]] also dot the landscape, although most have played out. [[Mephit|Mephits]] converge at [[Mephit Spring]], or at least they did until a [[Demon|demon]] recently seized the valley. Although two [[Volcano|volcanoes]] remain active or at least will soon return to activity, at least one other, the [[Klarwa Fountain]], lies extinct. Even some human cities in the area have died, like old [[Ekbet]], now known as [[Gralgor-Ot]] by its remaining [[Sphinx|sphinx]] inhabitants and the city's remaining [[Magic|magically]] enhanced guardians—the living monoliths.
> Major settlements in the area include [[Aphet East]] (350 souls reside near this oasis); Djeneg (a mineral spring city of 187 inhabitants); and [[Tar Kuata]] (78 inhabitants in this monastery of [[Irori]] in the [[Barrier Wall]] mountains).


## Inhabitants

> In addition to humans and [[Dwarves|dwarves]], the region hosts mephits, [[Manticore|manticores]], criosphinxes, hierarcosphinxes, [[Maftet|maftets]], and wyvrens. [[Behir|Behirs]] and [[Lamia|lamias]] live among a number of the hot springs. The region is also infamous for its relatively large amount of cults, including those of [[Urgathoa]], [[Lamashtu]], and [[Rovagug]], which flourish in the wastes.
