> The **Barony of Perin** was a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] barony northwest of the [[Aspodell Crossroads]]. The barony was controlled by [[House Vendikon]]. When [[Andoran]] still belonged to Cheliax, all three baronies of the area (Barony of Perin, Barony of Pamiatazova, and Barony of Darkmoon) belonged to the County of Elberwick. [[Galdur Vendikon|Lord Galdur Vendikon]] didn't embrace the revolution neither joined the evil Chelish empire. After the revolution, Lord Vendikon controlled little more than the few miles around his strategically important [[Baron Vendikon's Keep|keep]] in [[Piren's Bluff|Pirens Bluff]].
