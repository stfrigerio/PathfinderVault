> **Devil's Perch** is a mountainous area in the southwestern [[Menador Mountains]] in the far west of [[Cheliax]], and is home to a race of winged [[Humanoid|humanoids]] known as the [[Strix|strix]]. It is also a Chelish province, overseen by [[Parsellon Alterras|Provisional Governor Parsellon Alterras]] from the capital of [[Blackridge]] and defended by the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Gate]] out of [[Citadel Enferac]]. It is nominally part of the [[Archduchy of Hellcoast]], but due to widespread defiance of Chelish rule, many of its inhabitants operate independently.



## History

> The economic lure of rumored [[Gold|gold]] deposits drew imperial attention and led to Cheliax founding the town of [[Blackridge]] and installing Parsellon Alterras as its provisional governor some time after [[4700 AR]]. While rumors of gold never materialized and strix raids decimated one prospecting party after another, a prospector named Sorvus discovered [[Silver|silver]] near the strix roost of [[Crackspike]] around [[4711 AR]]. (Sorvus died within a day of reporting his find, reverting ownership of the claim to Cheliax.)
> Crackspike swiftly became a boomtown of ramshackle housing, taverns, and brothels, but was subsequently razed in a strix ambush that also killed 20 Order of the Gate Hellknight [[Signifer|signifers]], including their captain, [[Hellknight ranks|Paralictor]] Erevullo. After a second defeat of a 100-strong Chelish war party at [[Tokarai Springs]] in [[4712 AR]], the Chelaxians—represented by Order of the Gate Paralictor Adarai, Parsellon Alterras, and Chelaxian battlemage Velenne—forged a truce with the strix leader [[Kirii]] that limited their operations to a temporary encampment at [[Sorvus's Strike|Sorvuss Strike]] near Crackspike.


## Geography

> The mountainous terrain of the Devil's Perch is nearly impossible to navigate by land; it is plagued by deep abysses followed by near-vertical rock spires. This dramatic landscape has inspired the people of western Cheliax to create terrifying folktales about the region for centuries, and the presence of winged men who do not look kindly upon trespassers have only increased its reputation. Its few navigable passes are prone to flooding in the spring and snow during the region's long, brutal winters.


### Settlements

> Devil's Perch is sparsely settled by [[Human|humans]], and most of its land is unfarmable dust and rocky hills or mountains. Its most notable permanent settlements include:

> - [[Blackridge]], the recently built provincial capital
> - [[Citadel Enferac]], home of the Hellknight Order of the Gate
> - [[Whisper Creek]], a village halfway between Blackridge and Crackspike
> - [[Windspire]], a strix nest atop one of the Perch's many stone spires
> When under Cheliax's sway, the city of [[Pezzack]] might be considered part of Devil's Perch, and many people of the Perch hold some sympathy for the Pezzacki cause. However, Pezzack has remained in a state of open rebellion since the ascension of [[House Thrune]] to Chelish rule.
