> The **Desolate Shore** is the beginning of [[Stethelos]], where all visitors to the [[Dimension of Time]] arrive. It is a dank shoreline, between the ominous Viridescent Jungle and the vast Billowy Sea. Visible on the horizon is a green meadow; those who focus their attention on this distant sight will find themselves carried to the Green Meadow by a [[Raft|raft]] made of a sod that detaches from the Desolate Shore, which then falls behind and becomes unreachable from the Green Meadow.
