> **Icemark** is the north-westernmost of the realms in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], and is home to the [[Varki]], a [[Human|human]] ethnicity that is said to have descended from [[Varisian|Varisians]] who traveled north and intermarried with [[Tian]] exiles who had traveled over the [[Crown of the World]].



## Government

> Unlike the other realms claimed by the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, no [[Ulfen]] [[Linnorm King]] has ever ruled in Icemark, though today the Varki [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|ranger]] [[Nankou]] claims the title of [[Linnorm King]], along with titular rulership over the region.


## Economy

> The Varki earn their living as fishers, hunters, and trappers, as well as herding the reindeer of the northern tundra. They follow these herds wherever they go and pay no attentions to borders or boundaries, traveling into other Linnorm Kingdoms, or even into [[Irrisen]] (where they are strangely left in peace), or even into the distant [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]].
