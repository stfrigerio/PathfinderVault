> The **Ikkaku Peninsula** is one of three semi-autonomous regions of [[Minkai]], lying in the far north-east of the country. The peninsula is sparsely inhabited but those who do dwell there are a proud and tough people. They mostly make their living from mining the [[Kamifushi Mountains]], which run down the southern centre of the peninsula. In the north of the Kamifushi range is [[Mount Kumijinja]] which has a secret entrance to the [[Darklands]] layer of [[Nar-Voth]], known as the [[Ghost Path]]. In [[470 AR]], [[Ishanda Aiko|General Ishanda Aiko]] led an expedition along the Ghost Path. There were almost no survivors after Ishanda's army stumbled upon the outskirts of the [[Oni|oni]] city of [[Shirogoku]].
> The Kamifushi Mountains are also home to a large number of hot springs, many of which boast [[Healing|healing]] properties. These springs often have an accompanying temple to either [[Desna]], [[Kofusachi]], or [[Qi Zhong]]. Unlike in many other locations, the residents of the Ikkaku Peninsula have never attempted to make any profit from these healing hot springs.
> The Ikkaku Peninsula was remote enough to suffer little under the rule of the [[Soto Takahiro|Jade Regent]]. Staunch traditionalists who opposed his immoral reforms, many of the inhabitants of the peninsula event went so far as to harbour rebels and fugitives who opposed the Regent.
> Once per generation, a vast and [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghostly]] [[Kaiju|kaiju]] called [[Jakabu]] visits the Ikkaku Peninsula. A few weeks before Jakabu's appearance the seas around Ikkaku become still and a haunting moan is heard every evening. Then, finally, Jakabu emerges from the ocean surrounded by [[Undead|undead]] seagulls, flying [[Fish|fish]], and even stranger ocean creatures. For three days, the people of Ikkaku extinguish all lights except a parade of torches that leads to the peak of [[Mount Kumijinja]] where Jakabu ascends into the sky to return a generation later.
