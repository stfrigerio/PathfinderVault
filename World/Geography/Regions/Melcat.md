## History

> Throughout its history, rulership of the region had changed on a regular basis, much like the other fiefdoms in the area. In [[4661 AR]], a man named [[Razmir]] appeared, claiming to be a [[Deity|deity]] who had recently completed the [[Test of the Starstone]] and demanding that people worship him. Using his supposed [[Divine|divine]] powers, Razmir overthrew the local magistrate and Trades Guild of the city of [[Xer]], and began to gather followers by coercion and guile. 
> Eventually only the ruler of the River Kingdom, [[Melcat person|Duke Melcat]], resisted him from his capital of [[Aerduin]] in the [[Vergan Forest]]. Razmir arrived at the city on 17 [[Erastus]] and demanded three times that the Duke swear fealty to him; he was rebuked three times. That night, Razmir summoned a cloud of fire that engulfed the city, killing all of its inhabitants and reducing its structures to ash. On that night, the Arch-Duchy of Melcat ceased to be, and the nation of Razmiran was born.
