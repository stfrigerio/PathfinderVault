> **Westgate** is a mostly middle-class residential district on the western edge of [[City districts of Absalom|Absaloms city districts]]. It is populated by merchants, shopkeepers, and up-and-coming citizens who cannot afford more luxurious accommodation in the [[Petal District|Petal]] or [[Ivy District|Ivy Districts]]. To the southeast of Westgate is the [[Foreign Quarter]] and to the northeast is the [[Ivy District]]. This district is mostly residential, growing increasingly so as one travels closer to the city walls, yet there are also a number of shops interspersed throughout. Some of the oldest families with lineages stretching back thousands of years still call the district home. The area is thought of by some residents as the model of [[Absalom|Absaloms]] traditions. The [[Kortos Cavalry]] patrols the streets of Westgate as the [[Kortos Cavalry|Sally Guard]], and man the [[Sally Gate]] on the western walls of [[Absalom]].
