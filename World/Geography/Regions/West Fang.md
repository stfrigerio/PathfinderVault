> The **West Fang** is the western landmass of the [[Dahak's Fang|Dahaks Fang]] island in the [[Shackles]]. It is a much larger landmass than the [[East Fang]] and mostly consists of hilly plains dotted with clumps of rainforest. A few minor [[Goblin|goblin]] tribes reside in the West Fang, including the [[Biledrinkers]], the [[Stinkdragons]], and the [[Tongueyankers]]. The nomadic goblins constantly move about the island, both pursuing game and evading dangerous carnivores. The tribes are usually in conflict with one another. The goblins are frequently hunted by young [[Dragon|dragon]] devotees of [[Dahak]].
