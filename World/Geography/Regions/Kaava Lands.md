> The **Kaava Lands** are a peninsular region on the west coast of [[Garund]] and considered to be part of the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. The region is predominantly jungle, and the city of [[Senghor]] is situated on the northern coast of its western tip. The [[Oubinga River]] flows through this region. The lands are extremely dangerous and hence poorly explored. There is treasure to be found here, and travel is (comparatively) easy, as the region is less humid and less marshy than in some of the Expanse's other jungles. However, most who enter the Kaava Lands never return.
> As well as the ferocious [[Kaava]] tribe who give the region its name (or possibly *vice versa*)  there are also [[Demon|demon]]-worshiping [[Halfling|halflings]], pygmy [[Charau-ka|charau-ka]], the animalistic remnants of the people of [[Mbaiki]], tribes of [[Grippli|grippli]] forced from the Expanse and any number of less intelligent foes.
