> **Sinaria** is the most north-easterly county of [[Ustalav]] with the twin horrors of the [[Worldwound]], situated to its north, and [[Numeria]], to its east, both on the far shores of [[Lake Prophyria]]. Sinaria is a county within the [[Soivoda]] region.


## Geography

> Even ignoring the proximity of Sinaria to the Worldwound and Numeria, the county is, for the most part, an uninviting land filled with ancient, moss draped forests and cold, damp swamps. One of its swamps is home to the sadistic [[Black dragon|black dragon]] [[Seryzilian]]. The county is dominated by [[Lake Prophyria]] and around its southern shores is found the most fertile, habitable land where most of Sinaria's people make their living. These fertile fields surrounding the lake are filled with plantations which send their bounty to the county capital city of [[Karcau]].


## Karcau, the Village of Voices

> Karcau, the Village of Voices, is the shining light of Sinaria: a great city renowned for the [[Karcau Opera]] and its history as a city gifted with [[Music|musical]] genius. Even its ruler is a renowned belle of the Karcau opera, the beautiful [[Sasandra Livgrace|Countess Sasandra Livgrace]].
> Karcau is built atop a huge underground lake and has, beneath its streets, a maze of underground channels and submerged tunnels.
