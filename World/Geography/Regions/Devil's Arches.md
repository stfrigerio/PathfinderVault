## History

> Devil's Arches was one of the first major islands of the Shackles discovered by [[Cheliax|Chelish]] explorers some 600 years ago. Numerous [[Ghol-Gan]] ruins dot the entire island, enormous crumbling edifices, eroded towers, limestone platforms, amphitheaters, and ziggurats, covered with bas-relief carvings and paintings depicting acts of repulsive depravity, suggesting a bloody civilization in decline. A singular constant structure that stands at the center of each set of ruins, is a great gray stone arch without any carving or decoration. The Chelish explorers were impressed by these grand blatant eerie arches and referred to these landmarks as the Devil's Arches, giving the island its name. Many scholars and archaeologists believe that the arches may have once been diabolical gateways to summon the denizens of [[Hell]] or another [[Evil|evil]] [[Demiplane|demiplane]].
