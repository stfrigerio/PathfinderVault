> The **Wounded Lands** is the name given to the easternmost region of the [[Sarkoris Scar]], and which, until a few years ago, held a [[Worldwound|direct portal]] to the [[Abyss]]. To the east of the Wounded Lands stands the bastion of [[Mendev]], to the north are the [[Stonewilds]], and to the west lie [[Frostmire]] and the [[Riftshadow]].


## History

> When the planar portal formed in [[4606 AR]], it was a cleft about a mile long. As it grew, it transformed a region formerly known as the [[Northmounds]] into a winding, nightmarish canyon a mile wide and several dozen miles long. The terrain of this canyon was full of chaotic landmasses and bubbling, primordial coagulation, and the sky was full of [[Poison|poisonous]] fumes and lightning of all colors.
