> **Pitax** (pronounced pih-TAHKS) is the domain of [[Castruccio Irovetti]], a petty tyrant who fancies himself a god. Pitax is the name of his region within the [[River Kingdoms]] as well as the name of his capital city. It seems the [[River Kingdoms]] attract these sorts of deluded megalomaniacs, with the kingdom of [[Razmiran]] ruled over by the similarly deluded [[Razmir]]. The city of Pitax is filled with trashy art and bad sculpture, created by the masses of enslaved artists and poets that Irovetti maintains to massage his ego. The city suffers under Irovetti's rule, as his arrogant reign has turned the nearby countries of [[Numeria]] and [[Brevoy]] against him, and alienated Pitax from potential sources of trade.

## City of Pitax



### City layout

> Pitax is divided into three sections.

> - **Troutmouth** is the harbor district of Pitax. It includes the docks, various merchant houses, and warehouses.
> - **The Shattered Ward** contains many of the oldest buildings in Pitax including various temples and manor houses. Most longtime residents live here.
> - **The New Ruins** contains the most recently constructed buildings in Pitax. This part of the city was largely burned to the ground during the civil war that ravaged Pitax approximately one century ago. When Irovetti decided to make the city a beacon of "art" in the River Kingdoms his efforts were concentrated here. Notable locations include the Academy of the Arts and the Red Crescent Theater.
