> **Feyfrost** is the province of [[Irrisen]] governed and populated by the cold fey who assisted the Witch Queen [[Baba Yaga]] during the [[Winter War]] of [[3313 AR]]. The region is situated in the northeastern corner of the country, and is bordered by the [[Winterwall Glacier]] to the north, and the river known as the [[Frozen Road]] to the south. Although technically it is ruled by the [[Redcap|redcap]] [[Mauxpaudi]] from the capital of [[Chillblight]], it is actually governed by Chillblight's city council, as the Prince of Feyfrost is quite insane.
