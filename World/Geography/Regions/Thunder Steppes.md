> The **Thunder Steppes** are a vast tundra on the eastern borders of the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]]. They stretch all the way from the foothills of the [[Tusk Mountains]] in the west to the edge of the [[Worldwound]] in the east. The cold plains were once the domain of countless [[Kellid]] tribes who roamed the land, following the migrations of herd animals. Since the fall of [[Sarkoris]] and the opening of the Worldwound, the land has become increasingly foul and dangerous, and now only herds of megafaua remain and grow increasingly hostile as the [[Demon|demonic]] taint takes hold of them.
