> The **Giant-Downs of Urjuk** is a desolate land of [[Giant|giants]] on the [[Crown of the World]]. North of the [[Rimethirst Mountains]], these rugged hills are the homeland of the [[Frost giant|frost]] and [[Taiga giant|taiga giant]] clans of the region, and while most have migrated south into the warmer lands of [[Avistan]] or up into the grander mountain peaks, some clanholds yet remain; other giants hunt the [[High Ice]] as nomads but return periodically to Urjuk. Many giants return there to be buried.
> The [[Path of Aganhei]] passes through the Giant-Downs, but by ancient treaty, the giants do not harm travelers upon its length. Those that stray from the road, however, are fair game.
