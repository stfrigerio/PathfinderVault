> **The Verge** is the westernmost province of [[Irrisen]], bordering against the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. It was founded in [[3514 AR]] by [[Urvalane|Queen Urvalane]], creating it out of the province of [[Wintercrux]], and commanding its leaders to constantly harass the [[Ulfen]] to the west, but never to risk open warfare. The queen realized that this would allow her other provinces to focus on feeding their populations and increasing their treasure vaults, something which had been a constant struggle in the harsh, never ending winter the country toiled under.
