> **Kharijite** in northern [[Garund]] is the southernmost region of [[Cheliax]], and the only one not located on the continent of [[Avistan]]. It was wrested from the nation of [[Rahadoum]] by [[Haliad I|Prince Haliad I]] in the mid-42nd century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]] and has remained under Chelish control ever since. Its strategic location allows Cheliax to control the [[Hespereth Strait]] and both ends of the [[Arch of Aroden]], thereby exerting significant control over sea travel into and out of the [[Inner Sea]]. The inhabitants now consider themselves more Chelaxian than Rahadoumi, and it is considered to be part of the [[Archduchy of Longmarch]]. A large number of [[Brass dragon|brass dragons]] once lived in Kharijite, but most fled Cheliax after the [[Evil|evil]] [[House Thrune]] assumed control of the empire.
