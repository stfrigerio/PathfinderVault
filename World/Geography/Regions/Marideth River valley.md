> The **Marideth River valley** is a region of [[Nirmathas]] that roughly encompasses the southeastern portion of the country, primarily south of the [[Marideth River]]. The [[Molthune|Molthuni]] city of [[Fort Ramgate]] is also considered part of the river valley.
> This region has been a primary battleground in the decades-long war between Nirmathas and Molthune. As such, only a couple of small [[Human|human]] villages exist here: [[Acorn's Rest|Acorns Rest]] and [[Purt]]. [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Forests/Fangwood]] and [[Raven's Beak|Ravens Beak]] are former military strongholds that have either been abandoned or ruined during the war. Haunted or tainted locations within the area include the [[Dark Grove]] and [[Deadeye's Haunt|Deadeyes Haunt]].
> Non-humans have also made this region home. A tribe of [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] lives at [[Seesaw Rock]], [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]] infest a [[Old Hobgoblin Caves|cave network]] on the western edge of the region, and a [[Troll|troll]] has taken residence in a [[Sigurx's cave|nearby cave]]. Numerous fey claim fiefdoms along the river banks, though frequent flooding redraws the borders with regularity.  A [[Sea hag|sea hag]] named Schemedzah, an exile from [[Lake Encarthan]], has been uniting the fey under an iron fist to retake her territory at the lake.
