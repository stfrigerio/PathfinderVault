> **Almhult** is a collection of villages and towns located on [[Cape Almhult]] on the [[Crown of the World]], tied together by their shared [[Ulfen]] heritage. Though related to the Ulfen of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], they consider themselves a separate culture. The people of Almhult support themselves mainly through fishing, sealing, and whaling, supplemented with some farming during the short arctic summer. The Almhult Ulfen trade with both their southerly kin and the [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] of [[Hasanaliat]].
