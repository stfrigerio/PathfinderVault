> **Ulcazar** is the most remote, most uninhabitable and smallest of all the counties of [[Ustalav]] as it is located atop the highest peaks of the forlorn [[Hungry Mountains]]. Ulcazar is a county within the [[Soivoda]] region of Ustalav and is completely surrounded by the county of [[Amaans]].


## Inhabitants

> Visitors to the blighted land are rarely made welcome and immigration has been prohibited. Very few people live in Ulcazar, mostly lonely hermits and hunters, the most notable inhabitants are the [[Pharasma|Pharasmin]] monks who live in the mysterious [[Monastery of the Veil]]. The monastery is located at the headwaters of the [[Vhatsuntide River]] which flows down into [[Ardeal]] and is home to a unique order of monks. The monks are sworn to silence, all except the [[Yasmardin Senir|Bishop Yasmardin Senir]] who is not only the head of the order but the count in charge of running Ulcazar.
