> The province of **Wintercrux** is the industrial center of [[Irrisen]], producing the majority of weapons and armor for the armies of the [[Elvanna|Witch Queen]].
> Wintercrux is bounded by [[Glacier Lake]] and the [[Rimeflow River|Rimeflow]] and [[Marbleflow River|Marbleflow]] rivers to the north and east, the [[Kodar Mountains]] and [[Thundering River]] to the south, and the militarized province of the [[Verge]] to the west. The mines of Wintercrux produce ore and gems which are transformed into armor, weapons and jeweled luxuries for export in its capital [[Morozny]] on the Rimeflow.
> Most of the Wintercrux's settlements are located along the province's rivers. Those venturing into the interior must be ready to face [[Frost drake|frost drakes]], [[Ice troll|ice trolls]], [[Ogre|ogres]] or [[Frost giant|frost giant]] raiders from the [[Kodar Mountains]].
