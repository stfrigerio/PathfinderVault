> **Southmoor** is one of the seven current [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdoms]], located south of the region of the [[Grungir Forest]].



## Description

> Despite its relatively large size, Southmoor is the least important of the Linnorm Kingdoms, lacking organization,
population, reputation, and resources. It is located south of the Grungir Forest in one of the least civilized regions of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. The coastline is ragged, with few natural harbors and hundreds of miles of desolate moors and boglands. Only a small region around the kingdom's capital [[Jol]] in the central part of Southmoor, is cultivated and relatively safe. The city of Jol is the largest settlement in the kingdom but is a ramshackle and disorganized mess of a town run by the [[Linnorm King]] [[Ostog]], who ascended to the throne in [[4719 AR]] following the disappearance of his predecessor [[Opir Eightfingers]].
> The bogs, hills and mountains are dangerous because of wild animals and monsters but the greatest danger comes from groups of giants in the region. There are [[Marsh giant|marsh giants]] in the lowlands, [[Hill giant|hill giants]] on the [[Kodar Mountains]] and many [[Ogre|ogres]] and [[Troll|trolls]]. Traveling Southmoor requires organized and well-armed groups and every settlement has strong walls to withstand an assault. [[Linnorm|Linnorms]] lair in the far reaches of the region, usually deep in the Kodar mountains and are rarely seen, [[Fjord linnorm|fjord linnorms]] are known to hunt around the [[Devil's Drain|Devils Drain]] which dominates the channel between Southmoor and [[Dragon's Rib|Dragons Rib]] of the [[Ironbound Islands]].
> The giants, trolls, linnorms and worse dwelling in the eastern part of Southmoor are incidentally responsible for guarding the southernmost border between the Linnorm Kingdoms and Irrisen.

## History

> The region of Southmoor was once known as [[Cyrusian|Old Cyrusian]] and it was ruled by the descendants of [[Giant|giants]] who survived the fall of [[Thassilon]] for many centuries. The giants were often targets of glory-seeking [[Ulfen]] warlords but under [[Ledamaru|Queen Ledamarus]] rule in [[-450 AR]] the giants marched north in what is recalled as the [[Giantkin War]]. The army of giants advanced and managed to reach and lay siege to [[Kalsgard]]. At this time the Ulfen Kingdoms decided to fight back. [[Ulvass|King Ulvass]] repelled the giants and drove them back into Old Cyrusian. When the Ulfen reached the capital city of the giants, Queen Ledamaru in desperation used an ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] weapon which destroyed the city of [[Torandey]] along with both armies. By [[-440 AR]] all major giant tribes had been driven out of the region, forced to find shelter in the [[Kodar Mountains]] or in the [[Ironbound Islands]]. For many generations the land was claimed by dozens of barbarian tribes. In [[1102 AR]] [[Eskir Honeytongue|King Eskir Honeytongue]] claimed the area and established the Ulfen kingdom of Southmoor. He founded the city of [[Jol]] on the ruins of Torandey to serve as the capital of the new kingdom.
