> **Sevenarches** is a town in the southwestern [[River Kingdoms]] built around seven stone arches scattered around the settlement. It is an ancient site sacred to [[Elf|elves]], but has not been in elven hands since they left [[Golarion]] for the safety of [[Sovyrian]] millennia ago. Since then, Sevenarches has been under the rule of the [[Oakstewards]]. Indeed, Sevenarches is the only surviving kingdom from the initial wave of [[Kellid]] migration into the River Kingdoms region after the exit of the elves.



## Inhabitants

> The Oakstewards are very selective about whom they let approach the community, banning elves and outsiders from approaching, as Sevenarches guards a rift to the [[First World]] of the [[Fey|fey]]. As a result of the rift, followers of the [[Green Faith]] are extremely common. Sevenarches is also home to a wide variety of fey and many [[Arboreal|arboreals]], some of whom live in the city, while others are simply passing through. The forests of Sevenarches are also home to [[Centaur|centaurs]] and to [[Awaken|awakened]] animals, including a large pack of awakened [[Wolf|dire wolves]].
> Rumour has it that the arches for which the town is named once served as [[Portal|portals]] to other worlds, perhaps functioning like more powerful [[Elf gate|elf gates]]. [[Kyonin]] has shown great interest in reclaiming this ancient site, but the Oakstewards refuse any elven entry into Sevenarches due to the Obnubilate plague, a deadly, contagious and seemingly incurable [[Disease|disease]] that strikes any elf that approaches the arches. The druids have not disclosed the reasons behind their ban, as they do not believe that the elven government in [[Iadara]] would listen to the warnings of [[Human|humans]]. While this problem has yet to come to a head, there are rumours that some elves have been considering radical solutions to get rid of the human rulers of the town.


## History

> In [[4256 AR]], the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] were briefly ousted from control by the Intilporium, a [[Taldan]] [[Wizard|wizard]] family.


## Economy

> The town of Sevenarches is the first major stop for pilgrims and traders headed north on the Sellen. Two competitive supply companies are located in the town: [[Sellenmark Supply]] and [[Auldwell's|Auldwells]].


## Geography

> The ancient forest known as the [[Elderwoods]] marks the southern border of the land.
