> The **Pillars of Anferita** are a dramatic rock formation found at the delta of the [[Maiestas River]] in southwestern [[Cheliax]]. Enormous pylons of stone that jut out of the salty waters of the [[Arcadian Ocean]], the Pillars have been used by [[Pirate|pirates]] for centuries as a place to hide from their pursuers. The Pillars received renewed attention from both the [[Pathfinder Society]] and the local [[Aspis Consortium]], when the ancient [[Jistka Imperium|Jistkan]] city of [[Rachikan]] was discovered there.
