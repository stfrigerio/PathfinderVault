> The **capital region of Almas** is one of the five loosely defined regions within the nation of [[Andoran]], the others being [[Arthfell region|Arthfell]], the [[Carpenden Plains region|Carpenden Plains]], [[Darkmoon Vale]], and the [[Verduran Forest region|Verduran Forest]]. The region contains not only the capital city of [[Almas]], but also all the small villages within about a day's journey of the metropolis. As improbable as it may seem, nearly two-thirds of the entire nation's population live within this small radius, and its settlements serve as the home for countless farmers, craftsmen, and seasonal laborers. The region is also known as [[Freeland]], as it consists of property expropriated from the nation's nobility after the [[People's Revolt|Peoples Revolt]] and the establishment of [[Common Rule]].
