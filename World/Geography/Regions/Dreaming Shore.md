> The **Dreaming Shore** is the southern edge of [[Leng]], on the border with the grey Cerenarian Sea of the [[Dreamlands]], where the plateau descends from its normal altitude. The [[Moon-beast|moon-beasts]] black [[Galley|galleys]] frequently ply the waters around the Dreaming Shore, so while bold, adventurous ship captains from the Dreamlands might come there for adventure, few return for a second time.
