> **Arthfell** is one of the five general regions in the nation of [[Andoran]], and stretches largely along the coast of the [[Inner Sea]] from the western border with [[Cheliax]] to the [[Andoshen River]] in the east. It is thought to be bordered in the north by the [[Nogortha Peaks]]. The region gets its name from the [[Arthfell Forest]], which once covered the lowlands of most of western Andoran. Today, the woodland is but a small fraction of its former size due to millennia of heavy logging  to feed the massive [[Ship|shipbuilding]] industry in the city of [[Augustana]].



## Economy

> Having access to both the rich, tilled soil of the interior and the ocean, the Arthfell region is rich in natural resources, including grain (especially barley, hemp, hops, and millet), lumber, seafood, and wool. Craft goods are also produced in plenty here, most notably [[Alcoholic beveragesAle Beer Cider Mead and Other Similar Strength Brews|ale]], heavy rope, sailcloth, dyed textiles, and of course ships from the renowned shipyards of [[Augustana]].


## Inhabitants

> The people of Arthfell are generally hard-working and hardy, but many are not overly loyal to the government in [[Almas]]. This is especially true in the western reaches of the region close to the border with Cheliax, where former nobles whose land was expropriated during the [[People's Revolt|Peoples Revolt]] can find plentiful allies.


## Organizations

> The imperial loyalist faction known as the [[Seven Houses]] makes its headquarters in Arthfell. Its former nobles work diligently to undermine the fledgling democracy and restore the nation's former social order.


## Dangers

> The greatest dangers in the region include the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] and [[Arboreal|arboreals]] who protect the Arthfell Forest, the [[Undead|undead]] who dwell amidst the burial mounds known as the [[Nogortha Necropolis]], and [[Werewolf|werewolves]] that stalk the wilderness.
