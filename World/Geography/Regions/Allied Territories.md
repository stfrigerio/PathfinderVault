> **The Allied Territories**, or simply **the Territories**, is a collection of kingdoms, democracies, and theocracies spanning the continent **Ora** that represent the majority of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Humanoid|humanoid]] civilization on the [[Planet|planet]] [[Triaxus]]. While acting like a single federated unit, this alliance extends only as far as to represent the willingness of these territories to band together against invasion from the [[Drakelands]] or other threats. Despite being known as the Allied Territories, it is not uncommon for squabbling over territory, trade, uneasy mergers, wherein one territory swallows the other whole or splitting and dissolving in quick civil wars, to occur. Only when it appears that one of their number will likely conquer several of their neighbors do the other territories step in, with most only going to war when it benefits their territory the most. Some of the most important states of the Allied Territories include: [[Kamora]], where every citizen wears a blade to help defend against the [[Vampire|vampiric]] predators of the southern Uchorae Jungle; [[Zo]], the Port of a Thousand Ships; [[Aylok]], known for their fertile fields being able to breed the best cavalry during the summer years and white-furred horrors in the winter; and [[Preita]], the Scholar's Paradise, a place where gold is valued less than the accumulated knowledge and wisdom within the city proper.
