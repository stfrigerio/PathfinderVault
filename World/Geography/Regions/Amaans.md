> The [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of **Amaans** is filled with the towering mountain peaks of the [[Hungry Mountains]] and mysterious mist-shrouded valleys; it is one of the counties forming the [[Soivoda]].



## Government

> Amaans' ruler is as rugged and wild as the land he rules: [[Lucinean Galdana|Count Lucinean Galdana]] is a renowned hunter of fearsome, big game.


## Inhabitants

> Amaans has relatively few inhabitants when compared with counties like [[Canterwall]] or [[Caliphas]].  Most of these relatively few inhabitants huddle against the border with their more civilised neighbor [[Ardeal]] in the lowland region surrounding [[Lake Kavapesta]]. From their relatively safe homes, the inhabitants of Amaans tell tales about the horrors of the land, including the [[Hundred Haunted Vales]] of the Hungry Mountains, and rumours of the [[Undead|restless dead]] that haunt the [[Ghorcha Pass]].


## History


### Terror of Galdyce

> The terrors inflicted by the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] are not the only tales of horror the people of Amaans can tell.  In the last century, the county was ruled by the [[Galdyce|Viscount Galdyce]], an aged [[Nosferatu|nosferatu]] [[Vampire|vampire]] who took countless vampire brides in the vain attempt of siring a male heir.  Galdyce is thought to have been slain by the adventurers [[Duristan Barlhein]] and his fianc√©e [[Ailson Kindler]] in [[4685 AR]] and [[Castle Galdyce]] was destroyed.  Lately, lights have once again been seen in the ruined castle, leading inhabitants of the nearby village of [[Sen's Pass|Sens Pass]] to worry that Galdyce or one of his brides has returned.
