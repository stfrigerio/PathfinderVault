> The city of **Senghor** is a port on the Bay of Senghor, which is part of the [[Fever Sea]]. It is on the western end of the peninsula known as the [[Kaava Lands]] in the southern [[Mwangi Expanse]]. The [[Kaava]] are a pygmy tribe of [[Kech|kech]].



## History

> In [[2603 AR]], when [[Caldaru human ethnicity|Caldaru]] traders first came to [[Garund]] from their native [[Arcadia]], the people from nearby [[Boali]] welcomed them and offered them a plot of land to settle on. The Caldarus built the city of Senghor on this land and made marriage alliances with the few surviving Boali young nobles.
> In [[2618 AR]], after the people of Senghor discovered that Boali cultists were sacrificing young people in [[Ghol-Gan|Ghol-Gani]] ruins, they razed Boali, executed the cultists, and rescued would-be victims. Feeling guilty for violating Boali's hospitality, they then took in many Boali children. The story has since passed into legend, forgotten by all but a small cabal whose members are taught to fight cult resurgence.


## Inhabitants

> The city's dominant inhabitants are the [[Caldaru human ethnicity|Caldaru]], although they are not actually the most numerous of the various [[Human|human]] groups who live here.


## Geography

> The city's harbour is an architectural masterpiece, able to withstand both the very real impact of storms originating within the [[Eye of Abendego]] and the unlikely event of a massive naval assault by some as yet unknown enemy.


## Economy

> The city relies on ocean trade, as the nearby [[Kaava Lands]] make all land routes dangerous. It is a conduit for a significant amount of the trade from [[Sargava]] to [[Avistan]]; trading directly with Sargava risks annoying [[Cheliax]], and the more indirect route through Senghor makes it easier to circumvent the [[Shackles Pirates]].
> The city's market is the major site for the sale of quality goods from the [[Mwangi Expanse]] to merchants of [[Avistan]] for a fair price; this is in contrast to [[Bloodcove]], where arguably the region's raw materials are shipped off north in exchange for shoddy goods and cheap [[Alcoholic beverages|alcohol]]. The local guards, in their distinctive black and scarlet uniforms, make sure that the market is a safe place in which to do business.


## Government and defense

> Cheliax has attempted to establish a trade embassy in Senghor, but has found that communications have been plagued by bad luck and constant pirate attention. So far, none of this has been traced back to the Senghor government.
> The Senghor navy boasts several dozen ships, and ensures that no piracy takes place within their territorial waters. However, they are indifferent to what goes on elsewhere in the Fever Sea, making Senghor a popular destination for those who are deemed to be pirates everywhere else.
> However, this pragmatism does not extend to the [[Slavery|slave trade]]. Slave [[Ship|ships]] are not allowed to visit Senghor, and [[Mwangi human ethnicityBekyar|Bekyar]] vessels are frequently refused entry merely on suspicion of being connected to the slave trade. The Bekyar city-states to the south of Senghor have reacted angrily to this racial discrimination and there have been a number of sea battles. So far, Senghor has more than held its own in these conflict, and some of the city's leaders are keen to use it as a springboard for extending the city's sphere of influenceâ€”either southwards, or even northwards to the [[Avistan]] backed [[Aspis Consortium]]'s main base at [[Bloodcove]].
> The city is governed by a council consisting of nobles, priests of [[Gozreh]], merchants and the military. Council posts are generally inherited rather than elected, but so long as the city continues to prosper there are few calls for reform.
> When the natives of Sargava overthrew their overlords, Senghor sided with the former and became the first ally of newly-independent [[Vidrian]]. The two countries share an interest in keeping interlopers away, but the terms of the alliance, which had to be hastily signed by Vidrian, are heavily lopsided in favour of Senghor. The Vidric people have grown to resent these terms and now push for renegotiation.
