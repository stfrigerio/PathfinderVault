 A map of Bloodsworn Vale
> The **Bloodsworn Vale** lies within the [[Mindspin Mountains]] on the border between [[Varisia]] and [[Nirmathas]]. 


## History

> Bloodsworn Vale was the site of a large, months-long battle in [[4396 AR]] between the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] army led by [[Jakthion Korvosa|Field Marshall Korvosa]] and the defending [[Shoanti]] natives. It is generally held to have been one of the bloodiest battles of the [[Everwar]], which is what the Chelish war of expansion was eventually called. The fields of roses that lie in the valley mark the graves of the many Shoanti and [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelaxian]] soldiers that died fighting over this land.
> Near the end of the [[Age of Enthronement]], the vale was also a major trade route between Cheliax and its northern holdings in Varisia. The trail, however, fell into disuse during the [[Chelish Civil War]] and was eventually overtaken by the encroaching wilderness. In [[4707 AR]], [[Eodred Arabasti II|King Arabasti]] of [[Korvosa]] called upon [[Gyrad Tolgrith|Sir Gyrad Tolgrith]] to reclaim the vale and reopen the trade routes, resulting in the founding of [[Fort Thorn]] within the vale to aid in this effort.


## Inhabitants

> [[Flame drake|Flame drakes]] still haunt the wilder reaches of the Bloodsworn Vale despite nearly being wiped out when the Vale was reclaimed in 4707 AR. Many flame drakes fled into the surrounding Mindspin Mountains and began consorting with [[Giant|giants]] and evil [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fey|fey]], and conspiring against the people of the vale.
