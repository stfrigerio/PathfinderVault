> The **Lost Coast** is the name given to the coastal land of south-western [[Varisia]] stretching from the city of [[Magnimar]] in the south to the [[Fogscar Mountains]] to the north. It is a wild and desolate, yet beautiful, country full of lingering fogs, crashing waves, and small woodlands of pine and nettles along a rocky coastline of rugged bluffs. The waters along the coast feature plentiful fish, but are also home to dangerous predators including [[Bunyip|bunyip]], [[Reefclaw|reefclaw]], and [[Shark|great white sharks]].



## Inhabitants

> The [[Human|human]] population along the Lost Coast has expanded significantly in the past four decades. This has led to increasing conflict among the local [[Goblin|goblin]] tribes, both with the recent arrivals and amongst each other.

## History

> The Lost Coast has a history that stretches back through to the ages, holding significance to many nations, peoples, and gods.


### Age of Creation

> During the [[Age of Creation]], the Lost Coast was a range of sharp hills known as [[Rasp]]. In this age, the [[Demon lord|demon lords]] [[Lamashtu]] and [[Pazuzu]] engaged in a dalliance within the hills, resulting in the birth of several spawn and instigating a feud between the powerful [[Demon|demons]] that has lasted to the modern era.


### Age of Serpents

> In the early years of the [[Age of Serpents]], the hills of the Rasp were inhabited by [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]], [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]], and other reptilian creatures. When [[Elf|elves]] from [[Sovyrian]] came to [[Golarion]] to settle [[Kyonin]], a splinter group travelled north and founded the nation of [[Mierani]]. Under the influence of the elves, the human [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisians]] and [[Shoanti human ethnicity|Shoanti]] were raised from savagery and set on their way.


### Age of Legend

> [[Xin]], an exile from the human empire of [[Azlant]], came to the land which would one day become Varisia during the [[Age of Legend]]. Impressed with the cultures of the indigenous Varisians, Shoanti, and [[Giant|giants]], Xin chose this region to found his empire of [[Thassilon]]. The elves of Mierani resisted the expansionist drive of Thassilon, and later the nations of Xin's heirs, the [[Runelords]]. Meanwhile, the Rasp was turned into a battleground between the domains of [[Karzoug|Runelord Karzoug]] and [[Alaznist|Runelord Alaznist]].


### Age of Darkness

> Though the [[Starfall]] that started the [[Age of Darkness]] was directed at [[Azlant]], [[Thassilon]] was not spared. The volcanoes of the [[Kodar Mountains]] in the northeast were awakened, and their eruption, mixed with stray falling stars, devastated Varisia. One major impact occurred in the forest of [[Mierani]], which drove some of the elves there underground, where many would eventually become the first [[Drow|drow]]. A second ruinous impact was located in the heart of [[Xin-Bakrakhan]], which sunk the majority of that nation to the seafloor, becoming the [[Varisian Gulf]], and transforming the Rasp into the modern Lost Coast.


### Age of Anguish

> During the [[Age of Anguish]], Varisians began to rebuild their society, combining pre-Thassilonian traditions with advancements made under the Empire's rule. The [[Starfall]] had unfortunately awoken one of the spawn of Lamashtu and Pazuzu, a powerful [[Vrock|vrock]] called [[Uvaglor]], who enslaved the Varisians along the Lost Coast. The Varisians eventually overthrew Uvaglor by turning to the worship of Lamashtu, resulting in a battle along the Lost Coast. Finally, Sazzleru, a priestess of the [[Empyreal Lord]] [[Ashava]], managed to defeat both Uvaglor and the forces of Lamashtu.


### Age of Enthronement

> Through the [[Age of Destiny]] and into the [[Age of Enthronement]], the Varisians of the Lost Coast rebuilt their society, and eventually the stories of Uvaglor, Lamashtu, and Sazzleru became little more than legends. Aside from the rare explorers and adventurers, the nomadic Varisians who travelled along the [[Varisian caravan routes|Kaspakari caravan route]] were the only major inhabitants of the Lost Coast aside from [[Goblin|goblin tribes]], [[Ogre|ogre bands]], [[Ghoul|ghouls]], and other monsters.


### Age of Lost Omens

> The death of [[Aroden]] and the start of the [[Age of Lost Omens]] changed little for the Varisians of the Lost Coast. It wasn't until the founding of [[Sandpoint]] in [[4666 AR]] that the Lost Coast rose from obscurity and began its transition from wilderness to civilization.
