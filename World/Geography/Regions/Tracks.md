> The **Tracks** is a wild area of jagged cliffs, canyons, and arroyos north of the city of [[Thronestep]] in [[Razmiran]]. The region looks as if the earth is decaying to resemble a set of tracks; hence the name. A particularly deep canyon at the heart of the region is called the [[Forgotten Track]], and is the location of a secret prison mine where the [[Razmir|Church of Razmir]] sends those who have lost faith or who displease them.
