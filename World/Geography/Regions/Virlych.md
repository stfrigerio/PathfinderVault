> **Virlych** is the third region of modern [[Ustalav]], being neither a part of the [[Soivoda]] nor the [[Palatinates]]. Virlych clings to the south-western edge of Ustalav: it is a desolate, [[Undead|undead-haunted]] wasteland that is a part of Ustalav in name only.



## Geography

> Virlych is situated in the far south-western corner of Ustalav and it borders the [[Gravelands]] for much of its western and southern reaches, divided by the [[Path River]]. Only in the north-west does Virlych border the [[Orc|orc-infested]] [[Hold of Belkzen]]. To its north lies the relatively peaceful [[Palatinates|Palatinate]] of [[Canterwall]], while to its east lies the [[Soivoda]] county of [[Amaans]]. Geographically, Virlych is dominated by the high peaks of the [[Hungry Mountains]].
> The land of Virlych is a blighted one where only twisted, unnatural plants grow amidst desolate lands and it is racked by unexplained and highly unnatural storms.


## History

> Ustalav was finally defeated in [[3206 AR]] by the resurrected [[Tar-Baphon]], the Whispering Tyrant. The lands then had to withstand some six centuries of suffering until the victory of the [[Shining Crusade]], in [[38' AR]], when the Whispering Tyrant was imprisoned in [[Gallowspire]], where he remains until the present day. Despite its liberation, the six centuries of the Whispering Tyrant's rule had fundamentally corrupted the nation of Ustalav, and no where was this more apparent than in the ancient counties of [[Virholt]] and [[Grodlych]] which surrounded Gallowspire. Virlych was created out of the rotting remains of these two former counties, which had formed the epicentre of the Whispering Tyrant's burgeoning undead empire.


## Inhabitants

> No sane person dwells within Virlych: any inhabitants of the former counties of Virholt and Grodlych who did not die during the Whispering Tyrant's pillaging of the counties fled generations ago. Only predatory monsters and roaming undead call Virlych home. Nevertheless, despite the danger, visitors to Virlych include curious [[Arcane magic|arcanists]] desperate to scavenge any [[Magic|magical]] secrets remaining from the Whispering Tyrant's reign, explorers drawn to such fabled locations as [[Renchurch]], [[Ghasterhall|Ghasterhall the Palace of Travesties]] and the [[Garden of Lead]], and, in the past, patrols in [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] who checked the prison of the Whispering Tyrant for centuries before he broke free and destroyed their country.
> The most infamous resident of Virlych, the Whispering Tyrant himself, is no longer present, having freed himself from Gallowspire and destroyed it, leaving behind a blasted, mutated forest known as [[Gallowgarden]], before returning to his old headquarters on the [[Isle of Terror]].
