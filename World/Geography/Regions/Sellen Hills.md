> The **Sellen Hills** region of [[Numeria]] is a harsh hill country east of the [[Sellen River]]. The land barely supports life and is dotted with technological ruins. [[Giant|Giants]], [[Orc|orcs]], and other monstrous tribes fight with the many nomadic [[Kellid]] tribes for territory. Further east of the barren countryside, the area is home to [[Spine dragon|spine dragons]], [[Wendigo|wendigos]], and other monsters. To the south, the Sellen Hills give away to the Branthlend Foothills which become the Branthlend Mountains in the [[River Kingdoms]]. The river traffic is constant up and down the Sellen River from [[Hajoth Hakados]] to the large city of [[Chesed]]. Streams of soldiers and crusaders are heading north. The [[Technic League]] has little power in the region but its presence can still be felt.
