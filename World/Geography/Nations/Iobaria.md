> The land of **Iobaria** is located east of the nation of [[Brevoy]], north of the [[Castrovin Sea]], and is considered part of the continent of [[Casmaron]]. [[Human]] settlers have united the land into an empire in the past, but currently the land is largely wilderness thanks to a series of [[Diseases of Golarion|plagues]] that have severely depopulated the region.



## History

*See also: [[Timeline of Iobaria]]*

### Koloran

> No one is sure who lived in Iobaria in the early eons of the [[Age of Legend]], but someone carved the steps into [[Dirrinir]], a mountain in the [[Icerime Peaks]]. The first *recorded* inhabitants of the area were the [[Cyclops|cyclopes]] of the [[Koloran|Kingdom of Koloran]] who left ruins in Iobaria and are mentioned in the ancient texts of [[Iblydos]], itself one of the oldest [[Human|human]] civilizations of Casmaron. The Koloran cyclopes were refugees from the even older realm of [[Ghol-Gan]] in [[Garund]], and left that kingdom looking for a new life free of the brutality and bloodlust that would soon cause its demise. Although few hard facts are known about Koloran, it is thought that it ended in the planet-wide apocalypse of [[Earthfall]] in [[-5293 AR]].


### Ulfen settle Iobaria

> During the 700s [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]], [[Ulfen]] explorers from [[Avistan]] migrated east along the southern edges of the [[Crown of the World]]. They traveled east from the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]] until they reached the Castrovin Sea. There they spread out and attempted to subdue their new, hostile environment. [[Okormirr]] was the first Ulfen settlement east of the Lake, and was founded around [[752 AR]]. Okormirr then spawned the city of [[Orlov]], which eclipsed its predecessor in [[764 AR]]. In [[905 AR]], the ruler [[Iobar I|Iobar the Potent]] of Orlov succeeded in uniting the Ulfen of Iobaria into a single realm.
> The Iobarian empire at its height stretched from the [[Icewall]], [[Ice Steppes]], and the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]] in the north to the [[Myrfrus River]] in the east, [[Mendev]] (past the [[Icerime Peaks]] and [[Hills of Nomen]]) to the west, and the [[Castrovin Sea]] to the south. Iobaria also extended itself into Avistan, founding the colonies of [[Issia]] (now part of [[Brevoy]]) and [[Mendev]].


### The Plagues

> In [[1106 AR]] was the first recorded great plague, the Tearplague. Most of the plagues seem to have arisen from the forests. Iobarians have blamed cyclops ruins like [[Orosknir]], and in [['67 AR]] they blamed foreigners. The one plague which they tracked down to its source was the Chardeath in [[1634 AR]], which in [[1869 AR]] they tracked to the [[Necromancer|necromancer]] [[Otyb|Otyb the Undying]]. Even today a host of illnesses keeps the population low.
> The worst plague was the [[Choking Death]] of [['42 AR]] that killed three quarters of the population and led to a vicious pogrom remembered as the Native Plaguestrife, and entire cities were abandoned as a result of these tragedies. Thus weakened, the kingdom of Iobaria lost control of its vassal states, which rebelled against its control, only to collapse themselves once they were cut off from central support. Even after the Choking Death subsided, it never really disappeared completely from Iobaria, but continued keeping population growth in check for centuries.


### New Iobaria

> In [[3212 AR]], three warlords reunited much of Iobaria as [[New Iobaria]]. These fell into internecine strife before the unification was complete. King Irral I won the Restoration War in [[3304 AR]] (although peace was not declared until [[3309 AR]]) with the help of [[Dragon|draconian]] allies. In repayment, Irral ceded control of all cyclopean ruins not currently in use to the dragons. The human-occupied cities remained human, and humans retained a presence in strategically-important sites like [[Fralros]]. [[Antoll]] was the capital at New Iobaria's height, which lasted from roughly [[3312 AR]]–[[3679 AR]].
> More strife then occurred, but one clan emerged the winner by [[3870 AR]], pushing the rivals into Brevoy. This form of New Iobaria survived, somewhat stagnantly, until the [[Drakeplague]] of [[4519 AR]], when decline struck in earnest.
> In [[4606 AR]], the god [[Aroden]] fell and the [[Worldwound]] opened in the [[Kellid]] realm of [[Sarkoris]] In the next two decades, many Mendevians fled east, followed by the [[Sarkoris|Sarkorians]]. New Iobaria could not absorb the Sarkorians, and the kingdom collapsed again, starting at [[Mavradia]].


## Geography

[[Orlov]]
The former coastal capital of Iobaria manages to retain faint traces of its ancient grandeur. Its scheming prince dreams of re-establishing the Empire, but in fact does not even have enough troops to fully man the city's ancient fortifications.
[[Hask-Ultharan|Hask-Ultharan the Cairn of Many Torments]]
This is an enormous cairn of quarried stone blocks, marked in the script of the [[Cyclopes|cyclopes]]. The *[[Record of Truan Iolavai]]* describes how the scholar and his party investigated the cairn, against the advice of his local guides, only to be driven off by a howling mob of malformed [[Giant|giants]] led by the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Kostchtchie]].

## Inhabitants

> Iobaria today is sparsely populated, with most humans living outside of the old cities in tiny settlements. About eight of every ten inhabitants live in the endless forest wilderness in a state of semi-barbarism, and avoid the ruined cities of their ancestors altogether. The numerous diseases which emptied Iobaria two millennia ago have never disappeared completely, and still serve to keep its population very low. Other non-human races live as nomads in small packs.


#### Religion

> Today, Iobarians worship a vast group of minor nature spirits, and most religious figures are [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]].
