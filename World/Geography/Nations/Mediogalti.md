> **Mediogalti Island** (pronounced med-ee-oh-GALL-tee) is a small nation located off the western coast of [[Garund]], and is home to the [[Red Mantis|Red Mantis Assassins]]. It is also a haven for [[Pirate|pirates]] who sometimes bury their treasure in the island's interior.



## History

> Prior to [[Earthfall]], the land that would become Mediogalti Island was part of the Garundi mainland and formed the northwestern part of the [[Cyclops|cyclopean]] empire of [[Ghol-Gan]], which was at its height tens of thousands of years ago during the [[Age of Serpents]].
> For hundreds, if not thousands of years, the islands that make up the archipelago off the western coast of Garund were frequently visited by pirates. They used the main island's northern lagoon as a convenient location to anchor and re-supply, and found its interior an excellent place to hide buried treasure. Control over the lagoon passed between numerous pirate captains over the years, but none established any permanent settlement there.
> This changed in [[2559 AR]], when the imminent end of the [[Oath Wars]] in [[Rahadoum]] left the [[Red Mantis]] assassins in need of a new home. Following a vision from their god [[Achaekek]], they relocated to Mediogalti Island, and began to build their [[Crimson Citadel]] in the deep jungles of the island's interior.
> Once the Citadel was complete four decades later, the Red Mantis established what would become the city of [[Ilizmagorti]], which they intended to be a convenient place for them to meet and assess potential clients. They built it beside the northern lagoon used by the pirates, and it soon became a popular  "free port"  for pirate vessels seeking to avoid the tiresome laws and taxes in place in other ports. The fearsome reputation of the Red Mantis has also so far deterred foreign navies from launching punitive expeditions against Ilizmagorti's pirates.
> The appearance of the massive, permanent hurricane called the [[Eye of Abendego]] a little over a century ago has forced the traditional trade routes along the coast of western [[Garund]] to relocate further west, greatly increasing the amount of trade which passes by Mediogalti Island.


## Government

> The civilized parts of Mediogalti Island are run in an extremely laissez-faire manner by the Red Mantis; they allow the pirates to go about their business unmolested as long as they do not interfere in the assassins' affairs. The Red Mantis in turn are ruled by the [[Vernai]], a council of senior assassins, and the [[Red MantisOrganization|Blood Mistress]]. Since the assassins keep their identities secret, anybody in the street might be an assassin. In addition, they allow and even encourage the use of their signature [[Sawtooth sabre|sawtooth sabres]] by non-members, to maintain the atmosphere of uncertainty. This helps to keep crime down to moderate levels, despite the large numbers of criminal and lawless types who inhabit the island.
> The only other government figure is the mysterious [[Mayor of Ilizmagorti]] who lives lives in the topmost room of the otherwise unused lighthouse overlooking the harbor. Any citizen is able to gain an audience with the mayor, day or night, without an appointment—those who wish to do so simply stand in line and will be seen once the mayor has dealt with earlier arrivals.


## Inhabitants

> It is sometimes said that Mediogalti Island was uninhabited until the Red Mantis settled here. In fact, the interior has long been home to tribes of [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] and [[Kobold|kobolds]]. The former occasionally raid the outskirts of Ilizmagorti, whilst the latter engage in sporadic trade with the city. In addition to these two, there is also a sizable population of [[Goblin|goblins]] who fiercely defend their arboreal village of [[Ganda-Uj]] in the northwestern third of the island. These so-called [[Monkey goblin|monkey goblins]] are expert climbers and are skilled in the use of poison and [[Net|net]], making the territory around their settlement a dangerous one to explore. Lastly, the island's most dangerous inhabitants are a variety of [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaurs]] that have been known to attack the city when hungry.
> The island's lagoons and outlying waters are home to the [[Kaneano]] tribe. The Kaneano are members of a race of shark-like humanoids known as [[Adaro|adaro]]. While they may occasionally aid shipwrecked sailors, there are plenty of incidents where they have been accused of devouring them instead. Despite this, many of Ilizmagorti's citizens appreciate the Kaneano, as they are believed to keep down the populations of other aquatic predators.


## Geography


> Mediogalti Island is defined by its isolation, located in the [[Arcadian Ocean]] northwest of the raging [[Eye of Abendego]] (though nowhere near as close to the storm as the [[Shackles|The Shackles]]). Despite the island's large size, it does not appear on many maps or even in the right location on those maps that do feature it. This is a deliberate bit of deception, designed to make the home of the Red Mantis Assassins even harder to strike.
> The island itself is, for the most part, covered in tropical jungles that teem with dangerous creatures including various types of [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaurs]], savage [[Girallon|girallons]], and even rarer [[Weretiger|weretigers]].

### Settlements

 
> Although Ilizmagorti is the only city on the archipelago, there are a few additional settlements located there as well: two small villages (one [[Human|human]] and the other [[Goblin|goblin]]), and the secret, fortified stronghold of the Red Mantis assassins.
