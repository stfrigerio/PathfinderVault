*This article covers the nation of Katapesh. For information on the city of the same name, see [[Katapesh city]].*
> **Katapesh** is a nation of trade, selling all conceivable goods, no matter how mundane or bizarre. Traders converge on the nation's bazaars from around the world, even from other planes. [[Pesh]] and [[Slave|slaves]] are two of its major exports.



## History

***Main article: [[History of Katapesh]]***
> In [[2216 AR]], the [[Templars of the Five Winds]], led by the [[Djinni|djinni]] [[Nefeshti]], came to the region to free other djinni enslaved by the [[Genie binder|genie binder]] Kirnoth. The next year, the [[Sarenrae]] priestess Vedie brought her followers to the area, having fled from [[Osirion]].. 
> In [[3250 AR]], Katapesh broke free from [[Osirion|Osirian]] rule to become an independent nation.
> The mysterious [[Pactmasters]] who now rule Katapesh arrived out of nowhere in [[3725 AR]], took over the city of [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]], and established a powerful nation with economic ties throughout the kingdoms of the [[Inner Sea]].


## Government

> The inhuman [[Pactmasters]] form a ruling council that imposes few laws on Katapesh, allowing an nearly anarchic state of free trade. The Pactmasters use the [[Golem|golem]]-like [[Aluum|aluums]] to keep the peace and enforce the existing laws. Pactbroker [[Hashim ibn Sayyid]] serves the Pactmasters as the day-to-day manager of the government.
> Foreign relations are handled by a network of hired [[Human|humans]] and friendly merchants. Most nations, with the exception of slavery-hating [[Andoran]], are on good terms with Katapesh; the Andoren [[Gray Corsairs]] sank three Katapeshi slave ships in [[4705 AR]].


## Geography

> Katapesh encompasses many different land types and climates. To the north the [[Brazen Peaks]] mountains block the way to [[Osirion]]. Foothills and mountain passes offer passage to the northern country but, because of the ferocious [[Carrion King|gnolls of the Brazen Peaks]], most travelers prefer to reach Osirion by ship. South of the mountains, warm green savannas stretch for miles. Only tall trees offer moderate shade. Thin rivers and still pools provide water for the animals like camelopards, Katapeshi lions, gazelles, and more. Around a few hot spots where there are underground heat vents, the water turns murky and sulfurous, fostering small jungles. 
> Farther south still, the plains dry up into arid stretches of desert. This area is considered the breadbasket of Katapesh from which its citizens' livelihoods spring. The farmers there use the bulbous, spiny cacti to produce [[Pesh|pesh]], a pleasantly euphoric, mildly addictive drug.To the west, the deserts shift to rocky flatland that rises to become the [[Barrier Wall]] mountains. The eastern jagged coastline of Katapesh along the [[Obari Ocean]] create numerous natural harbors for the ships. The satellite island in the Obari Ocean holds the second most important city of the nation of Katapesh, [[Okeno]].
> Most settlements and inland trade routes are around the edge of Katapesh.


## Climate

> The weather in Katapesh tends to be fairly stable and dry year-round. The western and northern mountains push any moisture south, leaving the north of the country much drier than the southern savannah. Twice a year the prevailing winds off the [[Obari Ocean|Obari ocean]] collide with warm, moisture-filled fronts from the [[Mwangi Expanse]], creating fierce thunderstorms throughout the land which can last for several weeks. These rains provide the majority of precipitation for the year and fill small endorheic lakes throughout the drier lands, creating small, temporary oases.


## Religion

> The predominant religion is [[Abadar|Abadars]] faith. Abadar finds much support among the people in the famous markets of Katapesh. [[Sarenrae]], the goddess of the sun, enjoys the largest following after Abadar. Her admirable paladins play a major role in defending the nation. Cultists of [[Rovagug]] seek to destroy Sarenrae's followers. [[Desna]], [[Gozreh]], [[Nethys]] and [[Pharasma]] also enjoy moderate followings in Katapesh. Most of the gnoll tribes of Katapesh revere [[Lamashtu]].


## Inhabitants

***Main article: [[Inhabitants of Katapesh]]***
> Katapesh's inhabitants are a diverse lot, dominated by [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]] humans but intermixed with traders from across [[Golarion]]. The most common human ethnicities found in Katapesh are [[Garundi (human ethnicity)|Garundi]], Keleshite, and [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]]. The [[Badawi]], the desert natives in Katapesh, are nearly all Keleshites.
> Many dwarven settlements, abandoned or still occupied, are located on the Barrier Wall mountains. Local halflings command good wages as hired servants to traders and merchants. Most of the gnomes in present-day Katapesh live in the city of Katapesh, and the [[Finderplain]] has stood for 300 years as a waypoint for gnomes traveling south of the [[Inner Sea]].
> [[Harpy|Harpies]] also flourish in the wilder reaches of Katapesh and are such a common threat that slave traders will often bedeck their least valuable slaves in gaudy fake jewellery in the hopes that the harpies will leave the rest of their stock alone.

### Gnolls

*See also: [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll]]*
> [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|Gnolls]] are native to Katapesh and the nation's most recognized threat. Gnolls consider Katapesh their eternal birthplace, and attack settlements and raid caravans not only for the joy of the kill and the profit it brings but also out of fervent pride. Hundreds of gnolls make their homes in the mountains, most notably [[White Canyon]] and [[Pale Mountain]]. Gnoll slavers also appear in Okeno and Katapesh with slaves for sale. Katapeshi gnolls belong to one of five packs: [[Tribes of the Carrion King|Carrion tribe]], [[Duenas]], [[Razor Fang]], [[White Canyon|Sandstalkers]] and [[Spotted Hide]].



## Fauna

***Main article: [[Fauna of Katapesh]]***
> Katapesh is home to several unique species, such as the antelope-like calopi, [[Leopard|leopard-spotted]] camelopards, venomous [[Dhabba|dhabbas]], scavenging geiers, and [[Lycanthropic|lycanthropic]] [[Jackalwere|jackalweres]].
