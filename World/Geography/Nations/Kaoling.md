> Conquered by armies of vicious [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]] in the aftermath of the fall of [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]], **Kaoling** is now a two-tiered society ruled by ruthless hobgoblins with all other races serving as effectively a [[Slavery|slave-caste]].
> Recently, the nation of [[Oprak]] has made diplomatic contact with Kaoling via the *[[Onyx Key]]* [[Artifact|artifact]]. While this has led to profitable trade agreements, diplomacy has proven complicated due in part to Kaoling's harsh traditionalism.

## Culture

> Life for the hobgoblin population is very regimented, even by hobgoblin standards, and all its citizens hold a specific rank and status within its society. Harsh punishments are enacted upon any who attempt to rise above their station outside socially endorsed or official methods. The hobgoblin people as a result become particularly cold and distant, many expecting treachery from others as a matter of course.


## History

> Before the collapse of Imperial Lung Wa, the lands of Kaoling had always successfully beaten off the raids by the hobgoblins of the northern hills. After Lung Wa's fall in [[4606 AR]], the imperial armies stopped coming, however, and the hobgoblins soon realized their opportunity and invaded. In [[4610 AR]], they overthrew six squabbling [[Successor States]] in short order before halting their expansionist campaign and founding the modern hobgoblin nation of Kaoling.
