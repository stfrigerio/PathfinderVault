> **Droon** is one of the coastal nations of [[GarundSouthern Garund|Southern Garund]], beyond the [[Inner Sea region]]. It is generally considered to be one of the region's two most powerful nations (the other is [[Holomog]]). The land consists mainly of swampy river deltas, and is ruled by [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dinosaur|dinosaur-riding]] [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], and is the center of Iruxi culture.
> The nation shares its name with the most common trade language of southern Garund, Drooni.



## Economy

> Droon exports dinosaur leather as part of the Antarkos Sweep trade route.


## Inhabitants

> Iruxi are the central inhabitants of Droon that interact greatly with dinosaurs. Nobles settle feuds by participating in [[Ceratosaurus|ceratosaur]] duels, sauropod caravan trains help transport goods across extremely difficult terrain, and thieves will be aided by their whistling [[Velociraptor|velociraptor]] lookouts.


## Religion

> [[Grandmother Spider]] is one of the main goddesses worshiped among the citizens of Droon. Though the [[Night Heralds]] are also active in the area, the people of Droon would rather see them fully removed, and see them more as a shameful burden of their past.
> Lixiriltha also has a small cult operating in secrecy here.
