> The **Empire of Shu** was the largest empire ever known in [[Tian Xia]] but also one of the shortest lived, and its fall led to a century of chaos. The Shu empire was founded in [[3101 AR]], 25 years after the fall of [[Yixing|Imperial Yixing]] in [[3076 AR]], and the Shu are credited with saving civilisation across the continent. In fact, the imperial family of Shu was so beloved that an entire people took their name, the [[Tian-Shu]], still using that name to this day. Unfortunately, it was not to last and after a mere thousand years, a fifth of the length of time Yixing stood for, Shu collapsed in [[4036 AR]].
