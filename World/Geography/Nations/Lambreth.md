> The small, self-sufficient domain of **Lambreth** rose from the union of three rival merchant families, the [[Cullerton family|Cullertons]], the [[Angelidis family|Angelidis]], and the [[Vizcarra family|Viscarra]], who founded the city-states [[Maashinelle]], [[Lockridge]], and [[Sezgin]], respectively. Fearing annexation from their neighbors, the families negotiated a union, ruling as the [[Triunes of Lambreth]], in [[4502 AR]]. Throughout the [[River Kingdoms]], Lambreth suffers the least from bandit attacks. Newcomers and troublemakers quickly draw the attention of the [[Black Eagles]].



## History

> At one time, the domain was known as [[Alban]]. It was overwhelmed by [[Goblin|goblins]] in [[4071 AR]] and became the [[Barghest|barghest]]-ruled [[Kingdom of Zog]]. This came to an end in [[4217 AR]] when the [[Diseases of GolarionYellowtongue sickness|Yellowtongue Sickness]] swept through the region, crippling the kingdom. Weakened, it fell to a loose coalition of [[Adventurer|adventurers]], river folk, and [[Half-elf|half-elves]] that same year. The goblins of Zog left behind many pits, delves, and hidden cave complexes that have yet to be explored.

## Government

> [[Kamdyn Arnefax|Lord Kamdyn Arnefax]] rules Lambreth as a merciless dictator. The [[Black Eagles]], feared horsemen resembling dark versions of [[Andoran|Andorans]] [[Eagle Knights]], act as the local militia, protecting the citizens, collecting taxes, and enforcing Lord Arnefax's rule. In addition, each village has its own council, led by an elected mayor, who makes requests and complaints to Lord Arnefax, although most are wary to do so.


## Settlements

> - [[Lockridge]]
> - [[Maashinelle]]
> - [[Sezgin]]

## Relationships with other nations

> Lambreth lies very close to the theocracy of [[Razmiran]], and this proximity has brought about a violent history between the two nations as Razmiran seeks to expand its land and influence through conversion.
