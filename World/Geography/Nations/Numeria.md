> **Numeria** (pronounced new-MARE-ee-uh) is a barren, harsh land inhabited by tribes of savage [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]] and corrupted by the strange [[Radiation|energies]] emitted by [[Skymetal|skymetals]] and other [[Technology|technological relics]] that fell throughout the land during the [[Age of Darkness]].



## History


### Quest for Sky

***Main article: [[Quest for Sky]]***
> During the [[Age of Darkness]] (around [[-5051 AR]]), the [[Human|human]] [[Kellid]] tribes of north-central [[Avistan]] began to emerge from the caves they had been living in since [[Earthfall]]. This was brought on by the [[Quest for Sky]], the mass emigration of [[Dwarves|dwarves]] from the realm of [[Nar-Voth]] to the surface. The dwarves did not drive the humans out directly, rather they pushed the [[Orc|orcs]] of the [[Darklands]] ahead of them, and it was this latter group that pushed the humans from the caves they had been living in.


### Rain of Stars

***Main article: [[Rain of Stars]]***
> The next major event in the region was the [[Rain of Stars]], which occurred in [[-4363 AR]]. Numeria was still a pre-literate, tribal society then, but the event was so dramatic and consequential, that it burned its way into a people's collective memory. That night, the *[[Divinity]]*, a [[Spaceship|spaceship]] from [[Androffa]], crashed on [[Golarion]], breaking apart and burning through the atmosphere and falling in pieces across Numeria. Some fragments were the size of a fist, while others were as large as towns. The largest piece, known today as the [[Silver Mount]], fell near the future capital city of [[Starfall]], and the city itself derives its name from this event.
> The fragments emitted a strange [[Radiation|radiation]] that persists to this day, [[Mutant|mutating]] nearby life.


### Tiger Lords

***Main article: [[Tiger Lords]]***
> The [[Tiger Lord barbarians|Tiger Lords]] were once a mighty Kellid [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarian]] tribe from the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]]. Led by the chief [[Armag]], they left their homelands and traveled eastward, warring with the many tribes of the southeastern Numerian plains in [[-1003 AR]]. Their eastward march was eventually halted by the [[Iobaria|Iobarian]] warlords and [[Centaur|centaur]] tribes of [[Casmaron]]. Today, they are a shadow of their former glory, recently led by a man known as [[Armag the Twice-Born]], who claims to be the resurrected spirit of the tribe's ancient warlord.


### Pathfinders & exploration

***Main article: [[Gojan the Sharp]]***
> In [[4308 AR]], [[Gojan the Sharp]]—one of the first [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]]—petitioned [[Ontar]] the Black Sovereign for permission to explore the nation's technological ruins. After [[4318 AR|10 years]] of trials and near-enslavement under Ontar, the Black Sovereign relented and granted Gojan permission. The [[Pathfinder Society]] published his findings [[4319 AR|the next year]] in the third volume of the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]*, which spurred interest in Numerian artifacts. By [[4498 AR]], fewer than 200 years later, the densest collection of technological items and skymetals at [[Scrapwall]] would be fully depleted.


### Founding of the Technic League

![[Technic_League_from_Lords_of_Rust.jpg|right+hmed]]

***Main article: [[Technic League]]***
> The appearance of [[Sidrah Imeruss|a woman]] preaching opposition to Kellid taboos against technology and recruiting [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] to aid her in [[4501 AR]] soon led to the founding of the [[Technic League]]. While she was assassinated in [[4509 AR]] by her lieutenant [[Mulrach-Zeer]], the League persisted in its mission to exploit the alien technology and eventually gained entry to the [[Silver Mount]] in [[4512 AR]]. It quickly ascended to a position of power in Numeria that continued  unchallenged until very recently.


### Fall of Sarkoris

***Main article: [[Sarkoris]]***
> Before the [[Age of Lost Omens]], Numeria was a rising power in northeastern Avistan. Considered the largest, most powerful, and most aggressive of the [[River Kingdoms]], many thought that it was only a matter of time before the Numerians would unite several neighbouring River Kingdoms and created eastern Avistan's first true empire.
> The death of [[Aroden]] and the opening of the [[Abyss|Abyssal]] [[Portal|portal]] in the north of neighboring [[Sarkoris]] in [[4606 AR]] changed all of this. With an increase in the frequency of [[Demon|demonic]] attacks from the northwest, Numeria gave up its territorial ambitions and focused instead on protecting its borders. At the same time, thousands of refugees fled across the borders from Sarkoris, fleeing the demonic hordes, but found little welcome among the Numerians.
> Numeria became an important waystop for [[Mendevian Crusades|crusaders]] against the demonic horde. As thanks for Numeria's support, the crusaders built and donated [[Castle Urion]] to then-Black Sovereign [[Traskind Elf-Eye]] in [[4629 AR]].


### Rise of Kevoth-Kul

> [[Kevoth-Kul]] was a warlord of great renown whose massive [[Greatsword|greatsword]] cleaved through those with whom he could not reason. He forged strong alliances between many of the Numerian tribes and his followers believed that he would continue expanding their borders. This changed after he conquered the city of Starfall and claimed it as his capital. Here he came under the sway of the Technic League, debased [[Technomancer|technomancers]] who sought to unlock the powers hidden within the alien [[Artifact|artifacts]] found in the Silver Mount. Kevoth-Kul even began to consume the addictive fluids leaking from Silver Mount, which turned him erratic and sullen. He abandoned his dreams of territorial expansion, and instead indulged in pleasures of the flesh.
> Those who actively opposed the Black Sovereign during this time found that he was still a tenacious opponent, especially when supported by the vast legions of the fearsome [[Gearsman|gearsmen]] supplied by the Technic League. These artificial beings appeared a generation ago, brought forth from a previously unknown chamber in the Silver Mount, although the Technic League's control over them never seemed complete.


### Fall of the Technic League

> In [[4716 AR]], the leader of the Technic League (known as its Captain), died mysteriously and rumors began to circulate that a new [[God|goddess]] named [[Casandalee]] had emerged from Silver Mount. Left without a strong leader, agents of the League began fighting each other for control, and within weeks the organization collapsed. League members who survived fled Starfall, and allied themselves with Numeria's other tribal chiefs, supplying them with previously inaccessible technology. This began an arms race among all the chieftains that today threatens to push the nation into civil war.
> The dissolution of the Technic League freed Kevoth-Kul from his decades-long, [[Drug|drug-induced]] lethargy. Clear-eyed, he surveyed his realm and found that his absence had emboldened Numeria's other warlords, who each claimed their own sovereign territories. It is unclear whether the Black Sovereign intends to take back the lands he lost to the other chiefs, but after decades of making their own decisions, most Numerians are unwilling to take back their former, disgraced ruler.


## Government and foreign relations

> Numeria is once again ruled by the Black Sovereign Kevoth-Kul, a formerly drug-addicted despot who resides within his capital of Starfall. His control of the nation is spotty at best following decades of neglect. Numeria is also too vast a country to rule effectively with an iron fist. The people of Numeria are fiercely independent and prefer to avoid the gaze of their tyrannical ruler and continue making their own decisions, as they have for millennia. Relations with foreign governments, which under the rule of the Technic League were terribly disorganized, have completely collapsed now that the Black Sovereign is once again in charge.


## Geography


> Numeria is a harsh land of windswept plains and, while nearly devoid of valuable trade resources, the land possesses its own harsh, rugged beauty. Despite this beauty, the land is naturally barren and only the strong live to survive. The land has few geographical features: the biggest is the vast [[Lake of Mists and Veils]] that forms its northeastern border. The southern region also contains the northern headwaters of several of the rivers that eventually make their way into the [[River Kingdoms]] and is also crossed by the [[Sellen River]], which eventually empties into the [[Inner Sea]]. To its west lies insular, undead-haunted [[Ustalav]], to its northwest the [[Demon|demon-corrupted]] wasteland of the [[Sarkoris Scar]], and to the south the eternal war and turbulence of the River Kingdoms. The only (somewhat) stable nations on Numeria's borders are the former crusader nation of [[Mendev]] to the north and the kingdom of [[Brevoy]] to the east.

## Fauna

> Numeria is home to a wide range of fauna, both fantastical and mundane. These include [[Aurumvorax|aurumvoraxes]], [[Bison|bison]] (in the north), [[Hydra|hydras]],, [[Pseudodragon|pseudodragons]], [[Elk|river elk]],, and [[Wendigo|wendigos]].


## Economy

> Numeria is a land of few natural resources. It contains large, windswept plains and few forests of any size. It is, however, the largest supplier of [[Skymetal|skymetals]] in the [[Inner Sea region]]. These seven rare metals were part of the ship that crashed on Numeria's plains during the Rain of Stars. They each have their own distinct properties and are useful in the construction of [[Weapon|weapons]] and various magical artifacts. Of the seven, [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]] is the most common and known throughout the region as "Numerian steel". Other alien artifacts common to Numeria are [[Silverdisk|silverdisks]]: small, etched metallic disks frequently used as [[Currency|currency]].
> In ancient times, the tribes of Numeria exported a type of light-green rock rippled with dark-green fissures known as [[Veinstone|veinstone]]. This stone was a particularly popular building material in [[Osirion|Ancient Osirion]], and the [[Four Pharaohs of Ascension]] constructed their true pyramid from it.
> The [[Mendevian Crusades]] once provided an additional lucrative source of income for the nation, as the Sellen River was the main artery for [[Mendevian Crusaders|holy warriors]] traveling to Mendev from the south. The route to the region was known as the [[River Road]]. It began in the Inner Sea and followed the many tangled branches of the Sellen and [[West Sellen River|West Sellen Rivers]] to the Numerian harbor city of [[Chesed]] on the Lake of Mists and Veils. Even though the crusades brought strange faces and foreign ideas to Numeria, the Black Sovereign and the Technic League welcomed them with open arms while overcharging them for even basic necessities to make sure that they left with little more than their fervent faith to battle the demonic hordes of the Worldwound.


## Inhabitants

![[Numerian_mecha_scorpion.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 The land of Numeria is not for the faint-of-heart. Above, a [[Kellid]] [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarian]] battles an [[Annihilator|annihilator]] [[Robot|robot]].
> Numeria is a harsh, often brutal land that raises hard, often brutal people. The land's primary inhabitants are humans of Kellid stock who, outside of the large cities like Starfall and Chesed, organise themselves into tribes. While in theory these tribes all owe fealty to the Black Sovereign, outside of Numeria's big settlements and beyond the reach of his armies, life continues much as it has for eons. Raiding is still a popular and lucrative lifestyle, especially into the poorly organized [[River Kingdoms]], although those lands are not defenseless: river [[Pirate|pirates]] often travel up the Sellen and West Sellen Rivers to attack Numerian settlements before quickly retreating back south.


### Gearsmen

> One of the more unusual inhabitants of Numeria are doubtlessly the gearsmen who once patrolled the streets of Starfall under the control of the Technic League.


### Androids

> A new and quite unusual people have emerged recently from the scattered alien ruins of Numeria: [[Android|androids]]. Like the gearsmen, these sentient, [[Humanoid|humanoid]] creatures are created, not born. Unlike the gearsmen, they can almost be mistaken for humans, if it weren't for the glowing runes and circuits criss-crossing their bodies or their awkward, stilted mannerisms that make it difficult to relate to others.


### Kasathas

> The [[Kasatha|kasathas]] are a species of tribal nomads from the distant planet [[Kasath]] who came to Golarion during Skyfall on the *Divinity*. Most of them continue to live in Numeria.


### Other races

> [[Ru-shi]] [[Dhampir|dhampir]] vagabonds from [[Tian Xia]] are occasionally drawn to Numeria's technological wonders.


## Culture

> Because of their long exposure to the manipulations of the Technic League, many Numerians who live outside of the major cities are wary and superstitious of both [[Technology|technology]] and [[Magic|magic]].


### Religion

> Ancient gods such as [[Gorum]] and [[Desna]] remain popular in much of Numeria, while [[Nethys]] was a favorite among the mages of the Technic League. [[Brigh]], the goddess of invention, also has many followers, including a chapel within the chaotic [[Scrapwall]], which also hosts a cult-like gang known as the [[Lords of Rust]] who worship a little-known god named [[Hellion]]. There is some worship of [[Abadar]], mostly in the larger cities. [[Erastil]] has many followers, and the people of [[Iadenveigh]] are particularly dedicated to him. Even newer gods like [[Iomedae]] have begun to make inroads in the last century thanks to the increasing presence of [[Mendevian Crusaders]]. Since the opening of the Worldwound, demonic cults have grown in popularity as well, particularly those of the [[Demon lord|demon lords]] [[Deskari]] and [[Baphomet]]. Numeria's most recent divine arrival is the [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] known as Casandalee, whose apotheosis only occurred in [[4714 AR]].

### Death and burial

> While Starfall's inhabitants bury or cremate their dead much as those of most other cities, more rural stretches of the country follow older customs. Villagers may leave bodies out for scavenging [[Animal|animals]] to flense, bury their dead in soft soil, or construct deep barrows or build tombs in deep caverns. Loved ones leave keepsakes and tokens with the remains and maintain the deceased's memories through [[Art|artwork]], storytelling, or historical stone cairns.
