> The kingdom of **Lingshen** lies in the western half of [[Tian Xia|Tian Xias]] northern landmass. Some argue that it is the greatest of the [[Successor States]] of [[Imperial Lung Wa|Lung Wa]], although this opinion would be hotly derided by both the inhabitants of [[Quain]] and [[Po Li]].



## Geography

> Lingshen is the largest of the Successor States in terms of sheer land area, bordering numerous countries and geographical features. To the north, the [[Tuunma River]] marks the border with the sparsely inhabited region known as [[Shaguang]] and the [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]] kingdom of [[Kaoling]]. Further east, Lingshen reaches the [[Sea of Eels]] before being separated from [[Shokuro]] by a river, while the [[Gossamer Mountains]] mark the border with [[Shenmen]] before the eastern-most reaches of the country touch upon the coast of the [[Sea of Ghosts]]. To the south lie two of Lingshen's many rivals. Directly south is the Successor State, Po Li, while to the southwest sits the hero nation of [[Quain]]. Finally, the [[Wall of Heaven|Wall of Heaven Mountains]] forms Lingshen's westernmost border, separating Lingshen from the [[Embaral Ocean]].


## History

> Lingshen was formed in the wake of the collapse of Imperial Lung Wa in [[4606 AR]]. The once mighty empire fractured loosely along military, religious, and traditionalist lines, and Lingshen was formed by those of the military faction, which has had a large influence on the nation's culture. The Lingshen capital of [[Xiwu]] in particular is renowned for looking more like a military stronghold than a metropolis.


## Government

> Lingshen is ruled by the absolute monarch [[Huang|King Huang]], a controversial figure viewed as a hero by some of those who dream of a reborn Lung Wa, and a monster by almost all who have faced his armies. Each of King Huang's children is granted command of their own army as a way to prove themselves as military commanders. While his children are unquestionably loyal to their father, they fight and scheme relentlessly amongst themselves, even marching their armies against one another, as long as it does not endanger Lingshen itself.


### Military

> Lingshen's armies are rightly feared across the continent. When facing enemies in battle King Huang offers them a single chance to surrender, if they refuse they are then slaughtered, every man, woman and child, his soldiers even killing livestock and pets to prove a point. Lingshen also makes heavy use of terra-cotta soldiers in battle, these powerful [[Construct|constructs]] retain more intelligence than a typical construct, allowing them to follow and execute much more complex tactics.


## Culture

> Lingshen is renowned for it militaristic culture. Some have even remarked that the capital city of [[Xiwu]], a truly enormous metropolis, resembles nothing more than a vast military camp. The soldiers of Lingshen are so dedicated to their king that after their death their souls are bound into terra-cotta soldiers to continue their service after death. This loyalty beyond death is one of the so-called 99 proofs that Lingshen is the true inheritor of Imperial Lung Wa. Beyond war, the nobles of Lingshen value calligraphy above all other skills. [[Nine Inkwells|The Nine Inkwells]] is the name given to the nine most prestigious calligraphy schools of Lingshen that serve to educate the youth of the nobility in not just calligraphy but intrigue, art, and all the skills needed to rule. The [[School of Affinities]] is considered the greatest of these schools. Calligraphy is taken so seriously that duels are often fought between the students of these rival schools, and it is claimed that the military commander who can write their strategy in the most perfect brushstrokes is guaranteed victory.


### Religion

> The most commonly worshipped deities in Lingshen are [[Abadar]], god of walls and ditches; [[Hei Feng]], the duke of thunder; [[Irori]], the enlightened one and [[Yaezhing]], the minister of blood.
