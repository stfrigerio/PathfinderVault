> The **Tekritanin League** (pronounced tek-rih-TAN-in) was an early [[Human|human]] civilization which flourished in northern [[Garund]] during the early part of the [[Age of Destiny]]. It covered the area now largely claimed by [[Thuvia]].



## History

> The Tekritanin League was formed in [[-3250 AR]] when a number of nomadic bands united to counter the growing power of the [[Jistka Imperium]] to the west and [[Osirion]] to the east. Although the Tekritanins engaged in trade with both neighboring nations, border disputes and small wars were common as well. Unlike its rivals, the government of the Tekritanin League was largely decentralized, being composed a numerous, semi-autonomous city-states. The League assisted Osirion in the defeat of their greatest rival, the Jistka, although they were eventually betrayed by their erstwhile allies when the [[Four Pharaohs of Ascension]] defeated the League in [[-1452 AR]]. The League was disbanded soon thereafter, and a number of the easterly city-states were absorbed into Osirion, while the rest were razed by the victors.


## Culture

> Because of its less centralized nature, the Tekritanin League was a fertile mixing ground for all the cultures of northern Garund, even though border disputes with its neighbors to the east and west were common.
The League, along with the Jistka Imperium and Osirion, are credited with bringing civilization to northern Garund after centuries of barbarism during the [[Age of Darkness]]. Thanks to these early nations, civilization eventually traveled across the [[Inner Sea]] to spread across all of [[Avistan]] as well.


## Language

> The nomads of the Tekritanin League originally spoke many different languages, which eventually coalesced into a creole named [[Dead languages of GolarionTekritanin|Tekritanin]]. The linguistic influence of this language is still felt in the speech of numerous regional languages.
