> **Cordelon** is a small, independent country on the [[Sellen River]] in the southern [[River Kingdoms]]. Its centers of population are the village of [[Bacul Gruii]] and the larger [[Novoboro]]. Once long ago, Cordelon was a staging area for the return of the [[Elf|elves]] of [[Kyonin]] from their self-imposed exile in [[Sovyrian]]. Some of them stayed behind and eventually began intermarrying with the local [[Human|human]] population. Although the large majority of the people living in Cordelon now can be considered human, strong elven traits and features can be seen in most of them. The locals distrust outsiders, but welcome elves.
