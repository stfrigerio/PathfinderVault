*This is an article on the nation of Nex. For information on the person of the same name, see [[Nex person]].*
> **Nex** (pronounced NEKS) is a cosmopolitan realm on the southeastern coast of [[Garund]], filled with arcane wonders and ancient scars. It was established by the mighty [[Wizard|wizard-king]] [[Nex (person)|Nex]], who vanished 4,000 years ago.



## History

![[nex.mp3]]

> The nation now known as Nex grew up around the ancient city-state of [[Quantium]]. During the [[Age of Destiny]], the ambitious [[Archmage|archmage]] Nex gained control over Quantium and subjugated the nearby cities of [[Oenopion]] and [[Ecanus]], which became the foundation of the kingdom of Nex. Over the next centuries, Nex travelled [[Golarion]] and the [[Great Beyond]], brought the treasures he found to his kingdom, trained hundreds of wizards in the secrets he discovered, and used *wish*-level [[Magic|magic]] to improve and protect his realm.


### War with Geb

> In [[-892 AR]], Nex's territorial ambitions brought him into conflict with [[Geb's Rest]], the neighbouring kingdom to the south. Thus began Nex's legendary conflict with the [[Necromancy|necromancer]] [[Geb (person)|Geb]] that would change both wizards and their nations forever.
> The war between the two powerful wizards lasted over 1,000 years, as each had found methods of greatly prolonging his life. Geb devastated the land of Nex with powerful necromantic magic; the cities were protected but the rural areas became a barren wasteland that remains to this day. The land between the two nations become so thoroughly contaminated by their fighting that it was permanently transformed into the spellblighted desert known as the [[Mana Wastes]].
> Facing starvation, Nex enlisted the aid of the renegade druid [[Ghorus]] to create a new form of plant life that could survive the blighted landscape. These plants did indeed sustain the population of Nex, and over the centuries evolved into an intelligent species known as [[Ghoran|ghorans]].
> In the waning years of the conflict, Nex unsuccessfully besieged [[Absalom]] in [[166 AR]] (creating the famous [[Spire of Nex]]), and gained control of the isle of [[Jalmeray]] in [[253 AR]]. The archmage eventually gifted Jalmeray to the legendary maharajah of [[Vudra]], [[Khiben-Sald]].


### Disappearance of Nex

> In [[576 AR]], Geb launched a potentially decisive attack on Quantium, covering Nex's capital in a lethal fog which killed thousands of its citizens. Nex fled into the [[Demiplane|demiplane]] known as the [[Refuge of Nex]], and has not been seen since. The lesser wizards of Nex somehow managed to keep Geb from conquering the country in Nex's absence, and the war eventually petered out. Over time, an uneasy truce was brokered, and eventually trade was established between the two nations. Today, Nex imports most of its food from Geb, as its own land has still not recovered from the devastation of the war.
> In [[4716 AR]], the gates of the Refuge of Nex opened for the first time in millennia, stoking rumours of Nex's imminent return.


## Government

> Government in Nex has been a chaotic, complicated process ever since the archmage Nex disappeared over four millennia ago. Nex's rule had been unquestioned, but when he disappeared, the country was thrown into chaos.
> Since then, a variety of strange sects, arcane cabals, and cults of personality have ruled the country, each claiming insight into what the archmage's plans were for his abandoned nation. The external threat from Geb finally united the country enough to spur the creation of the [[Council of Three and Nine]], a ruling body which still tries to unify the various squabbling factions.
> Nex's current government that is mired in bureaucracy and political infighting Despite these weaknesses, Nex has never been conquered, and there are no signs of the Council of Three and Nine faltering.
> Some factions—most notably the [[Arclords of Nex]]—clamour for a resumption of the war against Geb on the grounds that it must surely be the will of the archmage to destroy his ancient enemy.
> Nex nominally claims the Grand Duchy of [[Alkenstar]] as a vassal, but no one takes this claim seriously, and Alkenstar is, for all intents and purposes, an independent city-state.


## Geography

![[Quantium.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 The capital city of [[Quantium]], Nex.
> Nex was devastated by the centuries of magical warfare between the two powerful wizards. All the lands outside of the magically protected cities were blighted by Geb's magic, turning them into a barren wasteland. These lands are now inhabited by tribesmen, outlaws, and the descendants of the magical beasts unleashed by Nex during the war (many of them created in the [[Fleshforge|fleshforges]] of [[Ecanus]]).
> Some hardy animals still survive in these barren lands however, including the territorial [[Axe beak|axe beak]].


### Settlements

> Nex's towns have been in existence since the Age of Destiny, although some have weathered the time better than others. They are among the most cosmopolitan in all of Garund, with the capital of Quantium rivaling [[Sothis]] at the height of the ancient god-kings.

> - [[Ecanus]]: Southern fortress town, home of the [[Fleshforge|fleshforges]]
> - [[Khulo]]: Former pleasure retreat, now part of an inescapable prison
> - [[Oenopion]]: City of [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemists]]
> - [[Quantium]]: Cosmopolitan capital, and grand memorial to the vanished archmage

### Features

> - [[Elemion River]]: Forms border between Nex and [[Katapesh]]
> - [[Miasmere]]: Heavily polluted waterway off the coast
> - [[Isle of Black Palms]]: Haunted island north of Valkus
> - [[Ndele Gap]]: Pass between [[Shattered Range]] and [[Brazen Peaks]]
> - [[Shattered Range]]: Forms the nation's western border with the [[Mwangi Expanse]]
> - [[Ustradi River]]: Flows from [[Alkenstar]] past Ecanus
> - [[Valkus Isle]]: Prison island in the [[Obari Ocean]]
> - [[Well of Lies]]: Ancient dungeon complex closed by Nex

## Inhabitants

> The [[Human|human]] population of Nex is primarily [[Garundi human ethnicity|Garundi]] and [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]], with a significant [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]] minority. Among the non-human races, [[Gnome|gnomes]] and [[Halfling|halflings]] are the most common.


### Arcanists

> Nex is also home to the largest assembly of [[Arcanist|arcanists]] in the [[Inner Sea region]]. They are drawn there by its magic-friendly government and its unparalleled magical resources. Some of these individuals come to Nex to study the dead magic zone of the Mana Wastes, hoping that exploration of the area will lead to a breakthrough in the understanding of the fabric of magic itself.
