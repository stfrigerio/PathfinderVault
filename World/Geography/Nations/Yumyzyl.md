> **Yumyzyl** is a tribal nation of [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] [[Human|humans]] on the [[Crown of the World]], stretching along the [[Ivory Sea]] coast from the northwestern feet of the [[Wall of Heaven]] to the edge of the [[Tashen Yakuta]] ice shelf. The centrally-located town of [[Kyzuv]] is the *de facto* capital, where the people gather annually; but the spiritual center of Yumyzyl culture is the ancient hold of [[Darinkhuur]]. The people of Yumyzyl are avid hunters of the Ivory Sea's [[Narwhal|narwhals]], [[Walrus|walruses]], and [[Whale|belugas]].
