> The [[Elf|elves]] of the nation of **Jinin** are descended from refugees who fled the [[Mierani Forest]] in [[Avistan]] before [[Earthfall]]. After arriving in [[Tian Xia]] hundreds of years later, in [[-4843 AR]] they founded a country that later adopted the [[Samurai|samurai]] tradition from [[Minkai]].


## Culture

> The elves of Jinin are noticeably more strict, organized, and orderly than their kin in [[Kyonin]], traits due to the social and moral codes they adopted from the samurai, and to their eventual learning of the fall of their kin, the [[Drow|drow]], into [[Chaos|chaos]] and [[Evil|evil]]. They greatly value tradition and personal honor, and primarily worship the deities [[Desna]], [[Qi Zhong]], [[Shelyn]], [[Shizuru]], and [[Tsukiyo]].


## History

> The elves of Jinin are descended from the same group of elves who refused to flee to [[Sovyrian]] as Earthfall approached, fled underground, and became the drow. As the refugee elves delved deeper into the [[Darklands]], one of them—an [[Oracle|oracle]] named Jininsiel—received a vision that they would find their salvation and a new home by following the roots of a [[Silver|silver]] tree and back to the surface. Most of the elves, however, believed that they would only survive by fleeing even deeper into the earth, leading to the refugees separating into two groups—those that followed Jininsiel's vision and went east, and the majority who continued their descent towards their eventual transformation into the dark elves of [[Sekamina]].
> Jininsiel's followers traveled under Golarion's surface for centuries, picking their way cautiously and slowly amidst the natural hazards and hostile natives of the Darklands. Eventually, they reached a thick, winding vein of [[Mithral|mithral]] ore strongly reminiscent of the roots of a tree. Concluding that this was the tree from Jininsiel's vision, the elves followed it upwards and emerged in central Tian Xia. Jininsiel passed away shortly thereafter, content that her people had found a new home, and the elves named their new nation Jinin in her honor.
> In [[3691 AR]], [[Tian-Min]] explorers from Minkai contacted Jinin. The elves were greatly impressed by the honor, courtesy, and dutiful lifestyles of samurai, and chose to adopt many of Minkai's cultural and political traditions to become a shogunate themselves.
