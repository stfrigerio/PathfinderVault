> The region now known as the **Sodden Lands** was previously a pair of now-lost kingdoms which were destroyed by the formation of the [[Eye of Abendego]] in [[4606 AR]]. In their place is a land constantly battered by storms and largely flooded with only a few isolated pockets of civilisation.



## History

> The Sodden Lands were not always the broken, storm-lashed swamplands that they are now, once two powerful but very different civilisations flourished here, [[Lirgen]] and [[Yamasa]]. 
> Lirgen was the northern most of these two countries. It was ruled the [[Saoc Brethren]], astrologers obsessed with prophecy and the stars. Much like everyone else they were caught by surprise by [[Aroden|Arodens]] death in [[4606 AR]] and subsequent forming of the [[Eye of Abendego]]. Not only was Lirgen battered by the massively powerful storm that now lay only a few dozen miles from its western shore but all the teachings in which the Saoc Brethren had put their faith in were proved wrong.
> The inhabitants of Yamasa faired (arguably) even worse than the people of Lirgen. The land of Yamasa was always considered somewhat primitive, especially when compared with more powerful [[Garund|Garundi]] nations like [[Osirion]], [[Nex]] and [[Geb's Rest]]. The first wave hit without warning, but it appears that even afterwards the people of Yamasa refused to evacuate. For a long time people thought that the entire nation had been destroyed, but the explorers who ventured into the Sodden Lands began to encounter survivors.


## Government

> The government that remains in the Sodden Lands is normally small scale and rarely benevolent, tribal leaders and violent juntas dominate the unfortunate people who still dwell within the Sodden Lands. 


## Inhabitants

> The advent of the Eye of Abendego killed many of the region's inhabitants, and forced many others to flee. However, there are still some people living in the Sodden Lands. The most common languages are [[Human languages of GolarionCommon|Common]] and [[Human languages of GolarionPolyglot|Polyglot]], and the main religions, apart from various cults, are [[Gozreh]] and [[Norgorber]].
> In addition to intelligent inhabitants, the Sodden Lands have also become home to a variety of dangerous swamp-dwelling beasts, such as [[Hydra|hydras]], including miasma hydras and warden hydras guarding hoards of treasure in the ruins of the drowned nations, and the infamous [[Muck bunyip|muck bunyip]] Old Wulunga.


### Boggards

> The region's [[Boggard|boggard]] population was once limited to one of Lirgen's three salt marshes. However, they were able to expand greatly following the advent of the [[Eye of Abendego]], and now dominate the northern part of the Sodden Lands. The boggards here believe the Eye has a connection to [[Rovagug]], and within a year of its appearance they had abandoned their traditional worship of [[Gogunta]] (accomplished by slaughtering Gorgunta's priests) and adopted the Rough Beast as their deity.
> Some of the tribes are ruled by boggards directly descended from [[Demon|demons]]. A few others are ruled by actual [[Hezrou|hezrou]].
> The boggards continue to breed at a great rate, but their constant in-fighting has so far managed to keep them from becoming a major threat to their neighbours.


### Grippli

> With the rise of the [[Angazhan]]-worshipping [[Charau-ka|charau-ka]] across the [[Mwangi Expanse]] many of the tribes of [[Grippli|grippli]] that once dwelt there have migrated west into the Sodden Lands.


### Lirgeni

***Main article: [[Lirgeni human ethnicity]]***
> There are very few Lirgeni remaining in the Sodden Lands. The people of Lirgen fled by [[Ship|ship]] from [[Hyrantam]] before the devastation of the Eye. Some Saoc Brethren and their descendants returned to try to find some way to extinguish the Eye of Abendego, but all such efforts have failed. Today, fewer than 5,000 Lergeni are thought to live in the Sodden Lands, and no Inner Sea port has seen a Lirgeni ship since the Eye's appearance.


### Lizardfolk

> The southern part of the Sodden Lands is dominated by [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]]. They live in small villages, each led by a warrior king or a spell-casting shaman (normally a [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] or [[Oracle|oracle]]). Unlike the bickering boggards to the north, the various tribes traditionally support their neighbours in times of trouble.
> However, recently an aggressive group of kings known as the [[Terwa Lords]] have been building up their own strength at the expense of more peaceful tribes. They have also been launching raids against the northern sections of the [[Shackles]]. Lizardfolk have also been attacking the Shackles settlement of [[Neruma]], which is built on lizardfolk breeding grounds.


### Marsh Giants

> The region has become home to numerous tribes of [[Marsh giant|marsh giants]] who worship their demon lord patron [[Dagon]].


### Shambling Mounds

> There is a large group of [[Shambling mound|shambling mounds]] in the Sodden Lands. They are inspired by [[Zandghoreishi]] the Jade Prophet, a shambling mound [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]].


### Sodden Scavengers

> The disaster that struck Lirgen and Yamasa attracted an organised group of [[Norgorber]]-worshipping looters. Many of them still remain in the region, but they have fragmented into roughly two dozen gangs that are collectively known as the [[Sodden Scavengers]].


### Tieflings

> [[Tiefling|Tieflings]] tainted by the blood of [[Daemon|daemons]], known as [[Daemon-spawn|Grimspawn]], have been drawn to the death and decay of the Sodden Land since the Eye's formation. Unnaturally thin, with sallow, pale skin, these tieflings are easy to mistake for [[Undead|undead]].


### Yamasans

> The ruling caste of Yamasa, the [[Koboto]], escaped destruction by the Eye. However, the ordeal reduced them to a feral tribe of cannibals.


## Geography

> The land is continually battered by the [[Eye of Abendego]], which dominates the landscape.
