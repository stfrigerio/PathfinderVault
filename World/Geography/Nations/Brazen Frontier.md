> The **Brazen Frontier** is one of the six regions of [[Osirion]] and forms the border area with [[Katapesh]] to the south. Its cognomen originates from the nearby [[Brazen Peaks]]. Travelers to the region will find a perilous land, dotted with canyons, ravines, and ridges. The arable portion of the land, however, is rather productive, producing cotton and foodstuffs, much of which is shipped down rivers like the [[Crook River|Crook]] and [[Asp River|Asp]] to other parts of [[Osirion]].
