> The historical [[Kellid human ethnicity|Kellid]] realm of **Sarkoris** (pronounced sah-KOHR-ihs) was a savage land of fiercely painted [[Warrior|warriors]] and [[Witch|witches]] located in north-central [[Avistan]]. Established in [[3672 AR]] after tribes defeated the [[Frost giant|frost giants]] of the [[Northmounds]], it lasted until the opening of the [[Worldwound]] in [[4606 AR]], after which it was quickly overrun by armies of [[Demon|demons]] who destroyed or corrupted all in their path. Today, the lands of **Old Sarkoris** are known as the [[Sarkoris Scar]].



## History


### Aroden and Deskari

> Sarkorian mystics had long identified that the barrier between [[Plane|planes]] was thin in Sarkoris. Historically, the central region of barrows known as the [[Northmounds]] was haunted by strange monsters, and infested by cultists of [[Deskari]], [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of the Locust Host. In [[4433 AR]], [[Aroden]] drove the cult into the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]] and, for a while, made the region safe from further [[Demon|demonic]] incursions.


### Society before the Worldwound

> Before its fall into the Worldwound, Sarkoris worshiped a host of different [[Deity|gods]], some of which are still known today while most have disappeared into obscurity. Though a good number of lesser deities, hero gods, and venerated heroes have been long forgotten, some names survive. These include [[Alglenweis]], daughter of [[Kostchtchie]], the Stag Mother of the Forest of Stones and the dawn-feathered children of [[Sturovenen]] the Dragoneagle.
> The western city of [[Dyinglight]] was the spiritual heart of Sarkorian religion, with an impressive ring of idols revering [[Pulura]], Mistress of the Stars.
> The country's central plateau was the site of numerous mines, and the nearby city of [[Iz]] was a centre of stone and [[Metal|metalworking]].
> Miners from the plateau would also trade in the city of [[Undarin]], rubbing shoulders with the herders of western Sarkoris bringing their flocks to market.
> The [[Shaman|shaman-ruled]] south eastern city of [[Storasta]] remained an independent city for centuries. However, following an incident in [[4000 AR]], the high witch-wardens of the three other major cities, Iz, Dyinglight, and Undarin, and the Warlord Uloric Dziergas annexed the city and brought it into the nation of Sarkoris.


### Demonic Invasion

> A few years before the prophesied return of Aroden, stirrings of new demonic cults began. Sarkoris' strange mystics made grim predictions of the nation's fall, speaking of ascendant [[Chaos|chaos]] and a thinness between the planes in their haunting orations. However, the people were mostly confident that Aroden's return would directly lead to a final end of these cults. Unfortunately, the mystics were proven correct when Aroden's death occurred.
> The death of Aroden in [[4606 AR]] also saw the appearance of the [[Worldwound]], a gaping gateway to the [[Abyss]], in the heart of Sarkoris. The nearby city of Iz was the first to fall to demonic forces, and the other clan-holds soon followed. The very land became warped and twisted, and demons continued to spew forth from the Worldwound.
> The city of Storasta was the last to fall, its sacred circles defended ferociously by tribal witches and shamans, aided by [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] from [[Mendev]] and [[Numeria]]. Their bloody last stand is commemorated in the tragic *Song of Sarkoris*.
> The church of [[Iomedae]], appalled by the demonic invasion, declared the [[Mendevian Crusades]] in [[4622 AR]] in order to drive back the demons. The first several crusades were somewhat successful at containing the threat but still the majority of Sarkoris remained firmly under demonic control.
> Only the remote southern town of [[Gundrun]] remained free during this time, mainly because the demons had more or less forgotten about it in their larger conflict with [[Mendev]]. Refugees of lost Sarkoris huddled there, all that remained of a once-proud culture.


### The Sarkoris Scar

> in [[4718 AR]], the Fifth Mendevian Crusade succeeded at vanquishing Deskari and closed the Worldwound. Since then, the land has been known as the [[Sarkoris Scar]], and the tribes that once called it home are beginning to resettle it. Several cities, including Storasta and Iz, have been reclaimed, but demons still rove the hills and plains and Sarkoris is far from returned to its old glory.
