> The **Protectorate of the Black Marquis** is one of the [[River Kingdoms]] of northeastern [[Avistan]]. Since its founding, it has been ruled by a series of despots who call themselves Marquis, despite having little proper claim to the title.



## History

> The Protectorate was established in its present form in [[4700 AR]] by a [[Pirate|pirate]] from [[Cheliax]] called [[Morgan the White]]. He was seeking a base from which to prey upon water traffic without being threatened by hostile navies, and the [[River Kingdoms]] was the ideal spot. Gathering together pirates from all over the world, he established his realm on a northern tributary of the [[Sellen River]] called the [[Dagger River|Dagger]], and named himself the White Marquis.


## Government

> Since then, rulers have come and gone—the current incumbent is [[Urdal Bazzak]], who styles himself the Black Marquis—but the methods remain the same. River traffic flying the flag of one of the River Kingdoms is allowed to pass unmolested, in accordance with the [[River Freedoms]]. Foreigners are forced to pay a toll, or risk having their vessels boarded, crews killed, and goods sold on the black market. Anyone willing to work as a river pirate for the Black Marquis is entitled to a share of the spoils taken by the Protectorate, under the terms of the region's [[Pirate Pact]].
