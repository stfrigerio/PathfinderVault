> The [[Dwarf|dwarven]] hold of **Zavaten Gura** is the most heavily populated area of the [[Crown of the World]] and the continent's only centralized nation. Located in the Stained Peaks north of [[Avistan]], down to its coast on the [[Cholpod Gulf]], Zavaten Gura's dwarven inhabitants heavily mine their mountain home for its rich [[Metal|metal]] deposits which they use in constructing the kingdom's cast-iron castles. As a result of the dwarves' incessant mining, however, the land has become despoiled in many areas by [[Toxic|toxic]] slag.
> The Guran dwarves do brisk trade with their neighbors, especially the [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] [[Human|humans]] of the Espinar River. Dwarven sailors from Zavaten Gura fish the [[Shining Sea]]; [[Fungus|fungus]] farms complement their diet.
> In Guran legend, the nearby Hills of Mournful Calling are haunted by their ancestors who once ruled that land until they were overrun by [[Giant|giants]]. The ruins of the [[Faded Hall of Lorngrim]] and [[Zunderwal Hold]] bear out these legends.
