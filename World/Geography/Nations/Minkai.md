> The **Minkai Empire** can be found on the continent of [[Tian Xia]]. It was one of the few nations that never submitted to [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]] and is renowned for its deadly [[Samurai|samurai]], clans of stealthy [[Ninja|ninjas]], and its strongly honourable cultural identity.



## History


### Early history

> Arguably, the earliest history of Minkai dates all the way back to [[100 AR]] when the [[Deity|goddess]] [[Shizuru]] bestowed her [[Divine|divine]] blessing on five Imperial families who would come to rule Minkai for the next four thousand years; the [[House Kaijitsu|Amatatsu]], Higashiyama, Shojinawa, [[Sugimatu clan|Sugimatu]], and the [[Teikoku family|Teikoku]]. Twelve years later in [[112 AR]], the Teikoku clan founded the [[Teikoku|Teikoku Shogunate]], a precursor to modern Minkai that lasted over 3,500 years. In [[290 AR]], the [[Samurai|samurai]] [[Zaokoyu]] effectively established Minkai's northern border with the [[Forest of Spirits]] when his army was destroyed there by a force of irate [[Kami|kami]].


### The founding of Minkai

> Minkai itself was founded in [[3616 AR]] by the so called [[Setsuna Kuga|Perfect Swordsman Setsuna Kuga]]. While the Teikoku had ruled for nearly 3,000 years and had, for most of this time, been known as just and honourable rulers, by the time of Setsuna, rot had set in. This blatant corruption of the Teikoku clan could no longer be tolerated by the people they ruled. Setsuna defeated the forces of the Teikoku Shogunate at the Battle of Eight Bridges in [[3616 AR]]. Minkai itself was formed three years later in [[3619 AR]] and as the old capital of Uddo was razed during the war, a new capital was established in the city of [[Kasai]], where it has remained ever since. In [[4559 AR]], an organisation known as the [[Golden League]] rose to prominence, effectively gaining complete control of Minkai and its economy for over a decade before being banished in [[4571 AR]].


### The Jade Regent

> After more than 1,000 years of relative internal peace, by the 4700s, Minkai was close to exploding into all-out civil war. Many of the smaller islands once controlled by the empire declared their independence. The successor to the Sakura Throne, [[Shigure Higashiyama|Emperor Shigure Higashiyama]], was imprisoned in [[4705 AR]] by the Higashiyama clan at their compound near the edge of the capital, supposedly to protect him. It was due to the clan's strength that war did not break out immediately, but there was a growing movement to release the Higashiyama's hold on the emperor, either by freeing or by killing him. The family clan replaced Shigure Higashiyama with a temporary ruler to quell the instability arising in the country, called the [[Jade Regent]], who was, however, quite unpopular.


## Government


### The cities, provinces, and regions of Minkai

> Minkai consists of **eight provinces** each ruled by an **imperial governor** who is responsible for ensuring the emperor's rule is upheld. The provinces grew from the influence on the hinterland of the major cities of the country; each province is named after its city, and the city is its capital and seat of power. Additionally, there are **three regions** of Minkai which are more independent and fall outside of the sway of an imperial governor. The cities, provinces, and regions of Minkai, then, are as follows:


#### The eight cities with provinces


> - [[Akafuto]] and [[Akafuto Province]]
> - Enganoka and [[Enganoka Province]]
> - [[Hiyosai]] and [[Hiyosai Province]]
> - [[Kasai]], the capital of all Minkai and [[Kasai Province]]
> - [[Oda]] and [[Oda Province]]
> - [[Sakakabe]] and [[Sakakabe Province]]
> - Shogokabe and [[Shogokabe Province]]
> - Wanshi and [[Wanshi Province]]

#### Three regions


> - [[Ikkaku Peninsula]]
> - [[Osogen Grasslands]]
> - [[Higashita Coast]]

## Geography

> Minkai is relatively isolated from the rest of Tian Xia, its only neighbouby land is the [[Forest of Spirits]], its [[Kami|kami]] inhabitants uninterested in conquest. To the east stretches the vast [[Okaiyo Ocean]] while to the west the [[Xidao Gulf]] separates Minkai from the rest of Tian Xia. Minkai has a surprisingly strong link with the distant continent of [[Avistan]] thanks to the [[Path of Aganhei]], a trade route that leads across the [[Crown of the World]].


## Religion
