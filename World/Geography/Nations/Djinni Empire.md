> The **Djinni Empire** covers the majority of the [[Plane of Air]], making the empire's [[Djinn|djinn]] its undisputed masters. The empire is ruled by [[Zafer XXXVIII|Sultan Zafer XXXVIII Lord of the Heavens and All the Stars of the Mortal Void]] from his spectacular [[Sussurran Palace]] in the Djinni Empire's capital city [[Armun Kelisk]]. He rules through a network of loyal viziers who each have their own regions with their own capital cities at the heart of each. The Djinni Empire focuses on acquiring lore and wisdom (at least as much as physical trade goods) both for its intrinsic value to their culture as well as for its trade value to others. The Djinni Empire is not just home to djinn but many other creatures including wandering tribes of [[Janni|janni]], various [[Mephit|mephits]], and the mysterious [[Elemental|elementals]] known as [[Invisible stalker|invisible stalkers]].
> The djinn and their empire claim to have always ruled the Plane of Air but some believe that this is not true. Rumour and whispers claim that once the djinn fought some ancient rival for rulership over the [[Plane|plane]], some claim these foes were another [[Outsider|extraplanar]] race, while others say it was against a pantheon of [[Deity|gods]]. Most agree that whomever these rivals were they had something to do with the mysterious [[Spheres|bronze and steel spheres]] that dot the plane and that the djinn refuse to go anywhere near.
