> The Kalistocracy of **Druma** (pronounced kal-ihs-TOK-rah-see of DROO-muh) is a land glutting itself on the wealth of trade, ruled by the high prophet of a strange, secular religion that values wealth and trade above any [[Deity|deity]]. This religion permeates every level of Drumish society, as followers of the [[Prophecies of Kalistrade]] favor each other in all business deals. While other religions are tolerated in Druma, their followers rarely go far, as the majority of the [[Resplendent Bureaucracy]] which runs Druma is made up of followers of the Prophecy.



## Government

![[Kelldor.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 High Prophet [[Kelldor]].
> Druma is run by the Resplendent Bureaucracy, the organization directly responsible for running the nation. Unfortunately, in a nation that values wealth above all else, few people wish to remain in a job that has steady pay but no opportunity for the advancement of their personal wealth. As such, members of the Bureaucracy only tend to stay there for up to a decade while they look for opportunities elsewhere. Above the bureaucracy is the man it serves, the [[Kelldor|High Prophet Kelldor]]. While jobs in the bureaucracy are not usually taken by richer merchants, the role of High Prophet is no mere job. Ruling a country of wealth-obsessed merchants and the political connections that brings, makes the High Prophet one of the most powerful men in the [[Inner Sea region]].


## Foreign relations

> Druma's relationship with its neighboring nations is interesting to say the least. Obsessed with trade, Druma is primarily interested in its neighbors as trading partners and little else. It finds [[Molthune]] to the west to be naive and unaware of its power or potential influence. The Kalistocracy owns large sections of [[Isger]], and hopes to purchase more in the future, in preparation for their "hour of victory" (*see [[Prophecies of KalistradeHour of Victory|Prophecies of Kalistrade]]*). Druma cannot understand the strange egalitarian principles of [[Andoran]], its neighbor to the south, and the wealthy merchants of [[Macridi]] find interacting with its citizens who (to Drumish sensibilities) do not know their place, particularly annoying. To the east, Druma eagerly eyes [[Kyonin]] and the untapped potential of the kingdom of the [[Elf|elves]]. Boatloads of goods are sent yearly to the Kyonin city of [[Greengold]] (the only city in the elven nation that allows humans) in the hopes of encouraging an expansion in trade.


## History


### The Macridi Blade culture

> Much like many other parts of Avistan, Druma was first inhabited by a branch of the [[Kellid]] people. While the ancient Kellids of Druma originally lived as nomadic pastoralists, they developed agriculture following the collapse of the ancient [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]] empire and eventually coalesced into a single cultural tradition. It is not known what name this society used for itself, although modern [[Archaeologist|archaeologists]] refer to it as the Macridi Blade culture after the characteristic stone blades associated with its sites and the modern-day town of [[Macridi]] where these were first found. The Macridi Blade people are known to have formed an extensive trading network thanks to their access to [[Lake Encarthan]] and its associated waterways: Macridi Blade sites have yielded pots of food from [[Gastash]], soapstone tools from the [[World's Edge Mountains|Worlds Edge Mountains]], wooden carvings from [[Kyonin]], and freshwater shells from the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]]. Additionally, the Macridi Blade culture developed its own techniques for working copper and [[Gold|gold]], and domesticated variants of millet, plum, sorghum, and vetch that are still cultivated in the modern day. During this period, a religion tradition known as the Speakers of the Pale arose, following on a belief system focused on mutual relationships between individuals and communities that was extended to [[Human|humanity]]'s relationship with the natural world and the afterlife. The Speakers served as intermediaries between their people and the [[Fey|fey]] of [[Palakar Forest]], negotiating for the harvesting of resources in exchange for compensation, and were often ritualistically buried within the local entrances to the [[Darklands]] to serve as protectors from the creatures living in the underground and to warn off living people from entering them.
> The Macridi Blade people's trade networks led to a period of prosperity, during which they raised cities of stone and brick and erected large earthwork projects of varied purposes under the Speakers' direction; these mounds are still found throughout modern Druma, as are the ruins of the cities. A still-undeciphered system of petroglyphs was developed and utilized by the Speakers, and the periodic recovery or elaborately braided rawhide strips from Macridi Blade ruins, alongside the presence of similar patterns in [[Art|artwork]] from that period, has led to speculation that these knotted patterns had some specific meaning of their own. The Macridi Blade people are not believed to have ever united under a single government, instead living as independent communities united by intermarriage and a shared culture.
> Contemporary descriptions of the Macridi Blade culture are limited, and largely restricted to records from [[Thassilon]]. One such record details the visit of a delegation from [[Cyrusian]] to the Macridi Blade city of Eahprin, which ended when an unknown slight against the Palakar fey led them to attack Eahprin and kill several members of the delegation. The surviving Thassilonians returned to Cyrusian, and used this incident to depict the Kellids as a barbarous people who [[Summon|summon]] monsters to devour their foes.


### The Age of Darkness and dwarven rule

> After having endured for about a millennium, the Macridi Blade society was ended by the disaster of [[Earthfall]]. Tremors from the [[Meteorite|meteorite]] impact caused mountain uplift to the south of the Macridi homelands, while the decades-long impact winter created by the tons of ejected material killed off much of the area's [[Plant|plant]] life and consequently caused the collapse of the Macridi Blade culture's agricultural system, resulting in devastating famines and the deaths of thousands. As a consequence, the survivors abandoned their now-unsustainable settled civilization, and adopted nomadic lifestyles much like those of their ancestors.
> The Kellids lived in this manner for a few centuries, a period which was in turn ended by the arrival of the [[Orcs|orcs]], who emerged onto [[Golarion|Golarions]] surface after being forced out of their traditional homelands during the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Quest for Sky]]. While the Macridi Blade culture might have been able to fend off the invading orc tribes, the scattered Kellid clans were unable to offer a meaningful resistance and, although the arrival of the dwarves some decades after the orcs' allowed the human clans to drive the orcs out of the lowlands, the clans were left bloodied and dispersed. The dwarves saw the surviving humans as a primitive culture and, while they initially offered them aid, this relationship soon developed a condescending nature; eventually, the dwarves came to see the Kellids' former homeland as an empty territory fit for colonization, named it Druma—believed to be a bastardization of a local word meaning "silver shore"—and incorporated it within their newly formed empire of [[Tar Taargadth]] in -4890 AR.
> Druma became Tar Taargadth's agricultural breadbasket, and was subject to relatively little mining. The Kellids continued to inhabit the area as subjects of the dwarves, being granted protection in exchange for grain taxes and political submission, but dwarven rule eventually began to clash with traditional Kellid practices. This led to a substantial incident when a dwarven landowner neglected to pay blood-price for having killed a Kellid herder's [[Goat|goat]], leading to a violent reprisal that was condoned by the Speakers of the Pale. Dwarven authorities decried this as vigilantism and responded with a crackdown on the Kellid religion, which led to a popular defense of the faith that was, in turn, suppressed by the dwarven governor. Tensions escalated into three years of open warfare, starting in -4866 AR, recorded as the First Drumish Rebellion, which ended with the Speakers having to flee to Isger and across Lake Encarthan; the Kellids came to view the exiled priests as martyrs and symbols of Kellid cultural autonomy. The dwarves also clashed with the Palakar fey, due to the dwarves' increasingly common forays for lumber and charcoal enraging the forest's natives. This spurred local [[Satyr|satyrs]] to demand tolls for access to lumber, which the dwarves saw as brigandry and refused to pay. The satyrs responded by kidnapping several dwarven trespassers, leading to seventeen years of armed conflict starting in -4411 AR, known as the Charcoal Wars, which resulted in the destruction of a quarter of the forest but which proved too costly for the dwarves to maintain.
> Despite the conflicts with the Kellids and the fey, however, dwarven rulership over Druma remained functionally uncontested for millennia. The area continued to supply Tar Taargadth with large quantities of food, and numerous dwarven [[Engineering|engineering]] projects survive to this day, such as the Aqueduct of Gtaldorn, the still-used road network, and the draining of the Heibarstol Marsh. Several cities were founded during this time, including [[Detmer]] in -1113 AR, which prospered as a haven for dwarves unwelcome in the [[Sky Citadel|Sky Citadels]] until rising water levels caused it to sink beneath Lake Encarthan. Three more armed conflicts occurred during this time: the decades-long Whisperfall Offensive against the orcs, and the Second and Third Drumish Rebellions; few records survive about the latter two conflicts, although the first ended in the death of a Kellid war leader and the second came after a three-year-long famine.
> The rise of the empire of [[Taldor]] began a period of decline in Tar Taargadth, and the news of a thriving human empire to the south, combined with the increasing weight of tariffs, taxes, and edicts caused Druma's human population to spark the Fourth Drumish Rebellion. Despite aid from allied war bands from Isger and [[Kestrillon]], the Fourth Rebellion ended in failure in 113 AR, like the first three did, and Emperor Hurognar responded by demanding that the Drumish people be "denied beards and [[Beer|beer]]", thereby prohibiting Druman men from growing facial hair or consuming [[Alcohol|alcohol]]. Although the edict was repealed on Hurognar's death, it had by then developed into a formal tradition and a way for local humans to reject dwarven culture. While Druman men continued to remain clean-shaven and abstinent, the women developed a counter-culture centered on symposia where they would drink, debate, and perform [[Music|music]]. These habits led to the formation of the roots of what would become modern Drumish culture.


### The Prophecies of Kalistrade

![[Prophet_of_Kalistrade.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A [[Prophet of Kalistrade]].
***Main article: [[Prophecies of Kalistrade]]***
> Roughly a century after the failed Fourth Rebellion, the prophet Kalistrade was born in [[187 AR]] and undertook his journeys, returning with coffers filled with wealth and adhering to a strict lifestyle. A cult quickly formed around him, spurred on by its adherents' financial success, and grew steadily until Kalistrade's disappearance in 251 AR. His followers collected his numerous writings, letters, and journals, forming them into early versions of the *Prophecies of Kalistrade*, but subsequently underwent a period of religious schisms that left the newborn religion fractured and with little influence. This lasted until Kalistrade's tomb was discovered in 408 AR, allowing religious leaders to commune with his remains and to syncretize their faith into a cohesive whole. One faction remained distinct from the new religious mainstream, however; this sect, known as the [[Golden Solidarity]], relocated to Kestrillon and adopted a life of giving and generosity. This was perceived as wasteful and inadvisable by other followers of Kalistrade, and the island's fall to [[Tar-Baphon]], which led to the massacre of the Golden Disciples alongside its other inhabitants, was perceived by the newly christened Kalistocrats as a cautionary tale.
> Over the following centuries, Kalistrade's faith endured but declined in favor of [[Aroden]]'s, aided by the Last Azlanti's victory over Tar-Baphon and the efforts of his evangelists to spread his faith. Aroden's status as the God of Humanity originally served as another rallying point against dwarven rule, but the reticence of his followers to support armed uprisings ultimately crippled his faith's hold on Druma and allowed Kalistrade's following to return to prominence.
> In [[1551 AR]], Tar Taargadth, having grown fractured and weakened, fell to a devastating series of orc attacks and eventually split into the five dwarven kingdoms of [[Gardadth]], [[Saggorak]], [[Doggadth]], [[Grakodan]], and [[Taggoret (city)|Taggoret]], which thereafter fought one another in the devastating [[Five Kings Wars]] beginning in [[1571 AR]]. The kingdoms, particularly Saggorak, levied increasingly harsh taxes against the Drumans, sparking the Fifth Drumish Rebellion against Saggorak in 1580 AR. The Fifth Rebellion itself only won the Drumans a reprieve from the wars and a lessened tax burden, but allowed the Prophets of Kalistrade to profit significantly from providing financial and material aid to the dwarven armies. [[2133 AR]] saw the immigration of several Isgeri Kellids fleeing their homeland's fall to Taldor's Seventh Army of Exploration, fueling further independent sentiment in Druma. The relatively minor Sixth Drumish Rebellion saw the formation of the Meritocracy of Jelheg in Druma's south, but the fledgeling nation's refusal to trade with the Taldans and the dwarves left it significantly impoverished, and it was eventually crushed by Taggoreti forces during a lull in the dwarves' internecine wars.


### Independence

> In 2331 AR, the Kalistocrats had amassed significant debts among the dwarven governments, allowing them to force the Five Kings to negotiate Druma's independence in exchange for forgiving their debts in the [[Kerse Accord]], signed in [[2332 AR]], which granted Druma full autonomy recognized by both the dwarves and by Taldor. The Kalistocrats established themselves as Druma's new ruling class afterwards, although the Burning Glove Riots of 2335 AR eventually forced them to relax taxation and provide greater opportunities for upward mobility. While the newborn country largely flourished after this, a faction driven by lingering resentment against dwarven rule and spurred on by Jelhegi influence and news of [[Rahadoum]]'s [[Oath Wars]] attempted to forcefully seize control of Druma's government, engaging in racially driven retaliation against Druma's dwarven citizens as it did so. Although this attempt failed and the extremist faction eventually lost popular support and dwindled away, Druma's reputation remained damaged for centuries to come.
> Relationships between Druma and the dwarves remain cold; even after the establishment of [[Tar Khadurrm]] by [[Khadon]] the Mighty, the dwarves rebuffed Drumish overtures due to their refusal to send aid when orcish attacks had caused the Five Kingdoms' collapse. The dwarves established trade routes with [[Cheliax]] that circumvented Druma altogether, which Druma responded to by strengthening its trade routes to the [[Shining Crusade]] to the north. When the Rending of [[Droskar's Crag|Droskars Crag]] crippled Tar Khadurrm and [[Ordrik Talhrik]] seized control of the ailing empire, however, Druma opened its doors to thousands of dwarven refugees, helping to rebuild many of the burnt bridges between the two peoples. In the following centuries, Druma prospered through its investments in Cheliax's [[Everwar]], caravans traveling along the then newly discovered [[Path of Aganhei]], and other ventures.
> As Druma had never been very reliant on [[Deity|gods]], it endured Aroden's death and the dawn of the [[Age of Lost Omens]] better than many other nations, although it was forced to restructure its mercantile networks as wars ravaged many of its trading partners. The rise of [[Razmir|Razmirs]] cult caused a brief period of instability in Druma's ports, resulting in strict restrictions on the spread of the Living God's cult in Druma. The [[Goblinblood Wars]] also impacted Druma, as the threats to its borders and trading networks, and a feeling of kinship towards the Isgeri people, saw Druma involve its [[Blackjackets]] in the conflict.


## Geography

> Druma's centralized location between the bustling waters of Lake Encarthan and the trade routes of Isger leading all the way to the [[Inner Sea]], makes it an ideal place for a nation of traders. Its rich mineral deposits ensure that Druma will never be short on goods to export. Druma is nestled between Lake Encarthan to its north and the [[Five Kings Mountains]] to its east and south. Its border to the west with Molthune is the only border not defined by a natural feature. Druma itself is predominantly hilly and much of its terrain is dominated by the mountains that make up two sides of its border. While the hilly nature of the terrain may not make it ideal for agriculture, it does conceal the mineral wealth that has helped to make Druma so rich.

### Prophecies of Kalistrade

 ![[Brea.jpg|right+hmed]]
 Members of the [[Mercenary League]], also known as Blackjackets, are paid well to protect Prophets of Kalistrade.
***Main article: [[Prophecies of Kalistrade]]***
> The most interesting thing about the people of Druma is their almost universal adherence to the Prophecies of Kalistrade. Nowhere else in Avistan are the followers of the prophecy so common. The prophecy states that its followers must adhere to strict rules about diet and sexual activity, and must also wear only white clothing and wear gloves to prevent contact with those outside of the cult. The prophecies' main tenet is that one must attain personal wealth in order to justify one's worth in the celestial order. This belief means displays of wealth are prominent amongst the citizens of Druma, and often gaudy in the extreme. Merchant lords of Druma frequently wear jewelry worth many thousands of [[Gold piece|gold pieces]]. Despite this, few would be stupid enough to rob an adherent of the Prophecies, as they are able to afford [[PathfinderWiki/Magic/Abjuration|magical protection]], [[Scrying|scrying]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|assassins]], and are often protected by members of the [[Mercenary League]], Druma's highly-paid and well-trained military.


### Religion

> Religions are tolerated but not encouraged by the Drumish government, but those who do not follow the Prophecies are looked down upon and rarely achieve high positions in the official bureaucracy. Nonbelievers also find conducting business here more difficult, as adherents always favor each other in any business dealings.
