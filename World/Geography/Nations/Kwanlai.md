> **Kwanlai** is an unstable nation of [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]], located on the east coast of the main continental land mass of [[Tian Xia]]. The nation was established after the fall of [[Lung Wa]] in an uprising known as the Feather and Starlight Rebellion, which was led by priests of [[Hei Feng]] and [[Desna]]. A group of Hei Fengan priests known as the [[Sunderstorm Covenant]] was instrumental in the rebellion, though they are now seen as contributing to Kwanlai's instability.



## History

> Kwanlai was initially founded by [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]] as a province for its tengu citizens in [[4280 AR]]. However, the support needed was never provided by the corrupt officials of the court and soon Kwanlai came to be treated as effectively little more than a prison colony.
> After the fall of Lung We, the task became how to govern a people who had spent the past millennia as vassals to other nations. This proved difficult given the tengu tendency of bringing dramatic flourishes and firey rhetoric to such debates.


## Inhabitants

> The large majority of the population are [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]], as it's part of their ancestral homelands, and is the largest population of tengu across Golarion.
> Some [[Ratfolk|ratfolk]] also live in the [[City of Whistling Swords]] alongside oni and other spirits.


## Religion

> Surprisingly Kwanlai is a centre of worship for the hateful rat god [[Lao Shu Po]]. [[Hei Feng]] also enjoys some worship in the nation, with the Hei Fengans generally serving as a destabilizing influence among the tengu.
