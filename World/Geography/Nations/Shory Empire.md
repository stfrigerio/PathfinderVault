> The **Shory** (pronounced shoh-REE) were an ancient people who traveled the world in great [[Flying city|flying cities]] during the [[Age of Destiny]] and created the **Shory Empire**. Their flying cities, and many other wonders, were accomplished through the use of a form of long-forgotten [[Magic|magic]] known as [[Aeromantic Infadibulum]].



## History



### Origins

> The Shory people were the result of intermingling between [[Garundi human ethnicity|Garundi]] nomads from southern [[Garund]] and the local [[Mwangi]] tribes of the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. In [[-2556 AR]], the Shory confederacy was founded by disciples of [[Black Heron]], one of the [[Ten Magic Warriors]] and an apprentice of [[Jatembe]]. They shared his magic with the other Shory tribes and encouraged them to unite against the southern cults of [[Rovagug]]. The Shory used air magic to raid the cults from their treetop homes, protecting northern Garund from them and fuelling their own fascination with the sky.


### War and flight

 > In [[-2381 AR]], the cults of Rovagug allied with the [[Bekyar]] and [[Angazhan|Angazhans]] [[Charau-ka|charau-ka]] minions and resumed their war against the Shory. The charau-ka were particularly effective in raiding the Shory's treetop homes. After the fall of the city [[Zetsibe]], the Shory created the first *flying platform* to extend their air superiority and allied with the [[Derhii|derhii]]. Eventually, the cults of Rovagug were broken with the defeat of Djakobu, a [[Thunder behemoth|thunder behemoth]] which they had previously controlled to destroy many Shory villages and cause minor earthquakes.


### Golden age

> In the following years, the Shory established among them a triune of [[Wizard|wizards]] to govern each city, and they began experimenting with the goal of lifting entire cities into the sky, rendering them unreachable by their foes. This culminated with the Aeromantic Infadibulum and the relocation of their capital [[Kho]] to the sky in [[-2323 AR]]. By -2289 AR, all Shory cities had taken to the skies.
> This launched the golden age of the Shory Empire, but also planted the seed of their fall. The sky-cities made enemies with [[Osirion]] and the [[Tekritanin League]] while inspiring fear in local tribes. Some Shory became racial supremacists and summoned [[Genie|genies]] and [[Elemental|elementals]] to be their [[Slave|slaves]]. Without a central morality, they even consorted with [[Daemon|daemons]] from [[Abaddon]] and squamous creatures from the [[Dark Tapestry]], while being unprepared against their dangers.


### Decline and fall

> The fall of the Shory was a long decline rather than the result of a single event. From Kho falling in [[-632 AR]] to [[Ulduvai]] in [[-507 AR]], Shory's magnificent flying cities fell to [[Disease|disease]], war, or monsters, or [[Yjae|fled the continent]] in failed attempts at survival. It is believed that most of these crashed flying cities lie scattered across the mountain peaks surrounding the [[Mwangi Expanse]].
> The few Shory who survived the fall of their cities assimilated into other cultures on the ground, and their history passed into myth. Many modern scholars now believe that the tales of the Shory cities' ability to fly to be nothing more than fanciful exaggeration.


## Flying cities

> The flying cities of the Shory were pinnacles of magical and [[Technological|technological]] innovation that have not been replicated since. Built of glass, [[Adamantine|adamantine]], and [[Mithral|mithral]], they were said to fly faster than the wind. The first of these, Kho, is said to have been destroyed by the first [[Spawn of Rovagug]], the [[Tarrasque]], although clear evidence of this has never been discovered. Little remains of these cities today, with the exceptions of the [[Kho|Ruins of Kho]], [[Ulduvai]], and the largely unknown city of [[Yjae]]. [[Artifact|Artifacts]] from the ruins are highly sought after by treasure hunters who hope to recapture the greatness of the Shory Empire. However, even when such items are discovered, none have replicated Shory [[Technology|technology]].


## The Shory today

> Rumors persist of flying buildings, glass spires, castles, and even entire cities suddenly appearing in the skies, or briefly being glimpsed through the dark clouds of the [[Eye of Abendego]]. Although unlikely, it is still possible that certain unliving Shory people have survived to today. Only one of these has been confirmed: the stranded sky-city of [[Yjae]], hovering over the desert of [[Shaguang]] in [[Tian Xia]].
