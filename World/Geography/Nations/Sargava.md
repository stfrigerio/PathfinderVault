*See also: [[Vidrian]]*
> Once the jewel in the crown of the Empire of [[Cheliax]], **Sargava** (pronounced sahr-GAH-vah) broke away from its motherland and became dependent on the protection of the [[Free Captains]] of the [[Shackles]]. The ongoing cost of that protection, along with serious problems with the indigenous inhabitants, crippled the former colony. This eventually led to open rebellion and revolution, and Sargava ceased to exist by [[4717 AR]] after being rechristened as the independent nation of [[Vidrian]].



## History

> The region was part of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] until [[4138 AR]], when the region was settled by Chelaxian colonists who imposed their rule on the native population. These explorers had previously scouted ancient [[Ghol-Gan]] ruins on the islands of the Shackles in [[4111 AR]], but were so disturbed by the images of [[Cannibalism|cannibalism]] and other atrocities they found there that they declared the region [[Curse|cursed]], continued south, and reached Sargava.


### Chelish Civil War

***Main article: [[Chelish Civil War]]***
> In [[4606 AR]], [[Aroden]], the patron [[Deity|deity]] of Cheliax, died. Cheliax descended into three decades of [[Chelish Civil War|civil war]] as the various [[Noble houses of Cheliax|noble houses]] fought for supremacy. [[Grallus|Baron Grallus]] backed [[House Davian]] in the war, leading Sargava's independence from Cheliax as a sovereign nation, and pledging his navy to Davian's cause in [[4609 AR]], but Davian's ambitions were shattered by [[House Thrune]] at the [[Battle of a Hundred Kings]] in [[4639 AR]]. House Thrune eventually won the war in [[4640 AR]].
> A Chelish fleet sent by House Thrune for revenge on Sargava was sunk in [[Desperation Bay]] by the [[Shackles Pirates]] in [[4643 AR]]. A second fleet sent in [[4660 AR]] fared little better, and Sargava clung on to its fragile independence from Cheliax.


### Rebellion and collapse

> The former colony continued to pay the [[Pirate|pirates]] for protection, despite the high cost, until 4717 AR, when Vidric rebels captured Sargava and broke the agreement. After the Free Captains retaliated by invading the new nation, Vidrian allied with Senghor and fended off the attack to earn its independence.


## Inhabitants

> The population of Sargava consisted mainly of [[Mwangi human ethnicity|Mwangi]] tribesmen, ruled over by the [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelaxian]] colonials. The colony's empty treasury made it difficult to control the tribesmen, and even prior to the rebellion, there had been several native revolts.
> Sargava's most commonly encountered tribes were the [[Bandu]], [[Bas'o|Baso]], [[Ijo]], [[Kalabuta]], [[Mulaa]], [[Ombo]], [[Song'o|Songo]], and Yemba.


### Culture

> The country's financial difficulties and the threat of retribution from Cheliax were blights on life in Sargava. The response of the authorities was to organise regular events designed to raise both morale and revenue. The most important of these was the [[Sargava Chalice]], a grueling extended footrace.


## Geography

> Sargava was unique in being a distant outpost of [[Avistan|Avistani]] culture in the sweltering depths of [[Garund]]. While the colonials' culture came from a continent away, the landscape was and is very typical of Garund and the [[Mwangi Expanse]] north of it. Much of Sargava was the lush but sparsely settled grasslands of the [[M'neri Plains|Mneri Plains]], but Sargava also boasted the lush rainforests that cover much of the Expanse. The [[Laughing Jungle]] dominated much of Sargava's southern border, while the northern border stretched through parts of the jungle known as the [[Kaava Lands]]. 
> The [[Korir RiverTributaries|Lower Korir River]] and the [[Lake of Vanished Armies]] marked Sargava's southern border. The [[River of Lost Tears]] flowed along much of what was the eastern border.
> Sargava also boasted mountains, as a section of the [[Bandu Hills]] ran just north of the country's centre.
