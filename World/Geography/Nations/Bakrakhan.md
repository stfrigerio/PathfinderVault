> **Bakrakhan** (pronounced BAK-ra-khan), the realm of wrath, was one of the seven nations which formed the ancient empire of [[Thassilon]] in northwestern [[Avistan]].


## History

> At the time of its destruction caused by the impact of the [[Starstone]], Bakrakhan was ruled by the [[Runelord|runelord]] [[Alaznist]].  The eastern border of Bakrakhan was a mountain range known as the [[Rasp]], which today forms the western coast of [[Varisia]].  Most of the kingdom sunk beneath the sea during Thassilon's destruction and now lies at the bottom of the [[Varisian Gulf]]. Bakrakhan was at constant war with neighboring [[Shalast]] and its ruler [[Karzoug]], and to this day, remnants of their feud can be seen along the coast in the form of ruined towers which were once called hellstorm flumes. Other ruins of Alaznist's kingdom are the [[Irespan]] in [[Magnimar]] and the mysterious [[Hollow Mountain]], which was once her capital city of [[Xin-Bakrakhan]].
