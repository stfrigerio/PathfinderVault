> **Echo Wood** is a forest located in north-western [[River Kingdoms]] and a region within that large country.
> Known to be home to crumbling [[Azlant|Azlanti]] ruins, the woodland is also home to monstrous [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spiders]] who are said to be building their nests within the ruins.
> The woods and its ruins are claimed as the territory of the [[Protectorate of the Black Marquis]], but the forest is mostly ignored by the rulers of the Protectorate. More recently, [[Thornkeep]] seems to have made a better claim on the Wood.
> [[Kellid]] raiders are a constant menace, sometimes passing through the woodland in order to raid the River Kingdoms.
