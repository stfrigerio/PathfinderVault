> **Sovyrian** is the ancient refuge of the [[Elf|elves]] of [[Golarion]], who used the *[[Sovyrian Stone]]* to flee there via a [[Portal|portal]] in [[-5293 AR]] to escape the destruction of the *[[Starstone]]*.  They remained there for millennia, and only began to return in [[2632 AR]] when they learned of the [[Demon|demon]] [[Treerazer|Treerazers]] attempt to corrupt the [[Magic|magical]] gate. It is commonly accepted that Sovyrian is the ancestral home of the elves.
> Although the truth of Sovyrian is known by few, even among the elves themselves, the location of Sovyrian is in fact on the [[Planet|planet]] [[Castrovel]]. Occupying the smaller continent of the distant world, these elves are isolated from the larger continents by constant storms and heavy winds. The elves of Sovyrian view themselves as custodians and guardians of the elven legacy, particular the legendary *[[Aiudara|aiudara]]* gateways. 
> The capital of the elven homeland is the city of [[El]].
> Many of the [[God|deities]] of the [[Elven pantheon|elven pantheon]] were originally from Sovyrian.
