> A successor state of [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]] on the continent of [[Tian Xia]], **Chu Ye** is a nation ruled by the malevolent shapechanging spirits known as [[Oni|oni]].


## History

> Chu Ye was originally founded as a province of [[Yixing|Imperial Yixing]] in [[302 AR]]. This was a because of one man, [[Soong Bai]], a gifted but eccentric hermit who had a chance encounter with an explorer from Yixing. The explorer had been wounded by a [[Disease|diseased]] [[Boar|boar]] but Soong Bai was able to save him via the use of acupuncture, an [[Art|art]] unknown in Yixing at that time. When word of this miraculous new [[Healing|healing]] method reached the courts of Yixing, it was decided that the empire needed some sort of presence in the area. Thus was born the nation now known as Chu Ye.
> The fate of Chu Ye changed rapidly after the fall of Imperial Lung Wa in [[4606 AR]]. Chu Ye was distant enough from the empire's core that it was shielded from the worst repercussions its collapse only to be assailed by something far worse. Unbeknownst to Chu Ye's [[Human|human]] inhabitants, the land was infested with oni. Accounts at the time make it seem as though almost every other man, woman, and child transformed into an oni. In reality, these fiends made up less than five percent of the population but with their incredible supernatural abilities this was still more than enough to overthrow the former rulers of Chu Ye in a single week. In [[4613 AR]], the nation fell into the grasp of the oni and for the first year the vicious fiends treated the nation as their bloody playground. After a year of terrible slaughter a [[Void yai|void yai]] oni warlord called [[Tsuneni|Shogun Tsuneni]] managed to gain control of the nation and the violence settled down somewhat. Shogun Tsuneni still rules Chu Ye to this day.


## Inhabitants

> Before the fall of [[Lung Wa]], Chu Ye was well-known for its [[Healer|healers]] and [[Acupuncturist|acupuncturists]]. After the fall of Lung Wa and its subsequent conquest by the oni, many of Chu Ye's healers fled. Even under the oni, [[Human|humans]] kept in [[Slavery|slavery]] by their oni masters practice their traditions in secret. Humans serve only as slaves within Chu Ye, conditions are brutal and humans are forbidden from owning [[Weapon|weapons]]. The corrupt rule and nature of the oni has also attracted many [[Evil|evil]] [[Giant|giants]] to settle in Chu Ye. Chu Ye is home to the most powerful [[Oni daimyo|oni daimyo]] in all Tian Xia, a three-eyed, four-armed creature known as [[Inma]]. Inma's stronghold is the [[Nightford Shrine]] located within the [[Nightford Mountains]]; the shrine's dungeons delve so deep that they reach all the way down to the [[Darklands]] below. Due to the number of oni that dwell within Chu Ye, the nation serves as a centre of worship for [[Fumeiyoshi]], the Lord of Envy, [[God|god]] of dishonour and patron [[Deity|deity]] of the oni.
