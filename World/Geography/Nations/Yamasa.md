> **Yamasa** (pronounced yah-MAH-sah) was once a proud, albeit comparatively primitive, agricultural land in western [[Garund]]. It was founded in [[3257 AR]] by farmers who broke off from the nation of [[Lirgen]] after marching on its capital.


## History

> In its prime, Yamasa controlled a large part of the trade of western Garund. It was organised in a caste system, with the ruling caste known as the [[Koboto]].
> Despite the nature of the country's birth, Yamasa and Lirgen managed peaceful coexistence together until both were destroyed at the time of [[Aroden|Arodens]] death in [[4606 AR]].
> Yamasa was completely unprepared for the advent of the [[Eye of Abendego]], and the storms struck with particular ferocity. Countless Yamasans died; whilst few would have been able to successfully flee the fury of the storm, there are rumours that they deliberately chose to stay behind rather than abandon their homeland.
> Nevertheless, some of the Koboto managed to survive. Today, they have broken their ancient tribal taboos and engage in [[Cannibalism|cannibalism]] and [[Necromancy|necromancy]] and, somehow, manage to continue to exist in what are now known as the [[Sodden Lands]].


## Settlements

> The capital city of [[Kokutang]] still stands alongside the [[Crab River]]. Much of it has been reduced to little more than underground, flooded caves, but there are still a few buildings on the surface. The Koboto use it as a seasonal gathering place.
