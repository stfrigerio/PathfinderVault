> The nation of **Amanandar** is a colony of the [[Taldor|Empire of Taldor]], located in the heart of the continent of [[Tian Xia]], serving as a center of Taldan culture on the other side of the world.


## History

> The current iteration of Amanandar began in [[4606 AR]] with the [[Army of Exploration|Eighth Army of Exploration]], before this the region had merely been another province of the empire of [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]]. With the fall of Lung Wa chaos engulfed the region much as it did across the rest of Tian Xia. Unbeknownst to the people of Amanandar months and months before this on the opposite side of [[Golarion]] the Eighth Army of Exploration led by General Orphyrea Amandar had set out in search of new lands. This army was ostensibly in honour of the return of [[Aroden]] but, more specifically, it was an attempt to revitalize the failing nation of Taldor which had been in decline for centuries. While the army set out with an optimistic goal, with the unexpected demise of Aroden terrible and destructive storms battered the fleet. After a harrowing journey the survivors of the Eighth Army of Exploration made it to Tian Xia landing on the northernmost reaches of the nation of [[Shenmen]]. From their Orphyrea Amandar lead her forces north along the [[Gan-Tzou River]] where they encountered the city of [[Kamikobu]]. The city was being fought over by twelve different bandit lords who all sought sole rulership of Kamikobu. Despite being exhausted from their unimaginable journey they had endured Orphyrea Amandar and the remnants of the Eighth Army of Exploration were able to overcome all of the bandit warlords. Kamikobu's people rejoiced and appointed Orphyrea Amandar its new governor who then renamed it [[New Oppara]] in [[4608 AR]]. With this act, the colony of Amanandar was established.
