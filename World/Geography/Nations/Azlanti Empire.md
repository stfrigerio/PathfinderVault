> The **Azlanti Empire**, or **Old Azlant**, is an ancient empire that existed on what is now the lost and shattered continent of [[Azlant]] in the [[Arcadian Ocean]]. It was the first center of [[Human|human]] culture on [[Golarion]]. Brought together by the alien intelligence of the [[Aboleth|aboleths]] (the name used by the [[Alghollthu|alghollthu]] for themselves and other related creatures such as the [[Veiled master|veiled masters]]), [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] society and culture grew by leaps and bounds until their arrogant leaders began to think of themselves as superior to their inhuman masters. In retribution, the alghollthus called down the *[[Starstone]]* in [[-5293 AR]], sinking the entire continent and condemning Golarion to the [[Age of Darkness]]. Now all that remains of the once-mighty continent are a string of islands and atolls spread across a large swath of the mid-Arcadian; they are the only parts of the continent still above sea level.



## Geography

> [[Earthfall]] shattered the Azlanti Empire and the continent of Azlant, sinking it to the bottom of the sea, where it was reduced to a maze of sea-canyons. The island of [[Mordant Spire]], on the far western edge of [[Varisia]], remains one of the few inhabited remnants of this once great continent. The [[Elf|elves]] who live there guard closely the secrets of old Azlant for fear that trespassers would bring a second doom upon the world.


## History

> Little is known of the history of the the Azlanti Empire, the first human civilization, other than the sad story of its destruction. Many scholars believe that the Azlanti people arose from the [[Slave|slave]] pits of the alghollthus, possibly indicating that their masters had engineered the Azlanti from primitive human stock and gifted them with intelligence and power, though there is no known evidence to back this theory. Others claim that the alghollthus simply set the early nomadic and cave-dwelling humans on the path to an advanced culture. Whatever the case may be, the Azlanti culture flourished for thousands of years upon the large continent in the middle of the Arcadian Ocean, reaching heights of [[Art|art]], [[Philosophy|philosophy]], and [[Science|science]] previously undreamt of by humans. What is certain is that not even the highest ranking or most enlightened humans knew they were being manipulated by supernatural forces until just before Earthfall.


### War with Ydersius

> Myths tell of an ancient war between the Azlanti and a race known as the [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]]. The Azlanti are said to have driven their enemies off the face of Golarion and into the [[Darklands]]. In the war's final battle, [[Savith]], an Azlanti hero, beheaded the serpent god [[Ydersius]] in the Darklands realm of [[Sekamina]].


### Founding of Thassilon

> The empire of [[Thassilon]] was originally founded by Azlanti exiles. These refugees were led by [[Xin]], a powerful mage who was cast out due to his belief that "lesser races" of the world could rival Azlant's greatness.


### Zura

> Some legends state that the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Zura]] was once a queen of Azlant who lusted after eternal life. In these tales, Zura's depraved acts led to Azlant falling into decadence and was one of the catalysts for the [[Age of Darkness]].


## Culture

> Ancient Azlant was the most [[Magic|magically]] and [[Technologically|technologically]] advanced human culture that ever existed, and the few [[Artifact|artifacts]] which surface in the markets around the [[Inner Sea region]] from time to time still draw great wonder and praise. Azlanti architectural styles or symbols have been copied from ruins and have inspired countless cultures throughout the centuries.


### The Spindle Solution

> The Spindle Solution was an Azlanti organization that sought to enhance human life through the development and creation of *[[Ioun stone|ioun stones]]*. Even though the work of this group benefitted thousands of Azlanti at the height of the empire, it was actually just a front organization for the Ioun Imperative, Azlant's espionage agency. This latter agency operated by a direct mandate from the emperor, who directed it to foster and defend Azlant's interests throughout the world, particularly in its ongoing struggle with the serpentfolk.


### Legacy

> Perhaps the most persistent legacy of Azlanti magic are the renowned *ioun stones* that they are believed to have first developed (or at least discovered). Since the fall of the Azlanti, no one has managed to match their knowledge or understanding of the arcane device. The leadership of the [[Pathfinder Society]] are especially enraptured by the *ioun stones*, but have limited real understanding about them.
