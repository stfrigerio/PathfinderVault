> **Gastash** (pronounced GAS-tash) was the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] realm of [[Zutha]], the [[Runelords|runelord]] of gluttony. Its borders were similar to the modern-day [[Hold of Belkzen]], stretching from the [[Kodar Mountains|Kodar]] and [[Mindspin Mountains]] in the west to the [[Tusk Mountains]] and [[Fangwood]] to the east.
> It was a peaceful and plentiful land overflowing with abundance. Its soil was fertile and there was always plenty of food left after the harvest. Gastash made a lot of profit selling its food to less agriculturally rich domains. Despite its peaceful and abundant appearance, Gastash still faced some serious problems. Its abundance attracted bandits and other raiders and the realm was infested with both [[Ankheg|ankhegs]] and [[Bulette|bulettes]], which spent a lot of their time gorging on nearby villagers. Despite these problems, Gastash was still a land of abundance and one of the better [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] domains to live in.
