> **Liberthane** was once a rundown bandit fortress in the [[River Kingdoms]] until it was taken over by [[Achille Parsall]], an [[Aristocrat|aristocrat]] of [[Galt]] who is also a [[Paladin|paladin]] of [[Milani]].
> It is the base from which Parsall seeks to recruit for his cause. In the long term, this is freedom for Galt; in the shorter term he seeks to unify the River Kingdoms. The hamlet serves as a bastion of idealism in the sometimes cut-throat society of the River Kingdoms, but all who live there are expected to follow the orders of Parsall and his soldiers.
