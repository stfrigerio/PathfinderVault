> **Minata** is the massive archipelago located on the far southeastern edge of the continent of [[Tian Xia]], also known as the **Wandering Isles** or the **Minata Archipelago**. It is home to the [[Tian human ethnicity|Tian]] ethnicity called the [[Tian human ethnicityTian-Sing|Tian-Sing]].



## Geography

> Minata is located in the southeastern part of Tian Xia. To the west, past a sea, lies the nation of [[Xa Hoi]] and the trackless [[Valashmai Jungle]]. Geographically, Minata is divided into three regions. From north to south, they are:

[[Atas Pulu]]
The northernmost and most successfully exploited part of Minata is home to the shattered and dormant [[Mount Shibotai]], whose eruption in [[-2524 AR]] blanketed Tian Xia in ashes; since then, the [[Volcano|volcano]] has been quiet.
[[Tengah Pulu]]
The largest region of Minata, characterised by mountainous jungles. The largest island, known as [[Belem]], is famous for numerous hidden coves and treacherous shoals.
[[Rendah Pulu]]
The southernmost and most feared part of Minata due to its inhabitants.
> Navigators from Tian Xia have attempted to map the isles to no avail, as the islands themselves seem to shift place, never appearing twice in exactly the same location.


## History

> According to legends, in the primordial days of [[Golarion]], Minata was once a great land bridge connecting Tian Xia with [[Sarusan]]. In this age, it was ruled by the mythical [[Taumata]] civilisation before [[Hei Feng]] came down to punish them for blasphemy. He tore Minata apart with his nine-ring broadsword, then scattered the islands on the [[Okaiyo Ocean]]. While this history is often considered to be nothing more than a fanciful myth (as is the very existence of a land bridge between Tian Xia and Sarusan), explorers often discover strange relics and architecture following no known Tian style.
> In -2524 AR, the volcano known as Mount Shibotai erupted forming the [[Shibobeka Islands]] while covering much of Tian Xia in volcanic ash. This coincided with the emergence of [[Wayang|wayangs]] onto [[Golarion]] from the [[Shadow Plane|Plane of Shadows]].
> One of Minata's most recently formed communities is [[Zo Piaobo]], a floating city formed in the aftermath of the fall of [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]]. A band of disgruntled former captains from the Lung Wa Navy founded the city in [[4609 AR]], just three years after Lung Wa's fall in [[4606 AR]].


## Inhabitants

 
 A [[Tian-Sing]] woman.
> Minata is the most multicultural region of Tian Xia. Many communities in the archipelago are isolated, despite their proximity to other islands, while some others are united under petty monarchs.
> Numerous small kingdoms claim part of Atas Pulu, some merely encompassing a single isle, and trade extensively with the mainland. Numerous [[Wayang|wayang]] tribes also live in Atas Pulu, believing that Mount Shibotai's eruption coincided with their migration from the [[Shadow Plane]] to Golarion. [[Inahiyi]], which sits on the volcano's old caldera, is a wayang city devoted to the appeasement of the [[Demon|demon]] still believed to live in the flooded crater. The city of [[Zo Piaobo]] floats between Atas Pulu and Tengah Pulu, and is home to Minata's largest [[Pirate|pirate]] fleet. Floating communities of [[Ysoki|ratfolk]] known as "Minata Skimmers" live on their floating barge cities and rarely set foot (or paw) on land.
> Tengah Pulu is home to numerous primitive tribes; while only a few of them practice vile customs like headhunting, [[Cannibalism|cannibalism]], or necrophilia, many mainlanders erroneously believe this to be the case for all tribes. The largest city in this region is [[Waunomani]], located on the eastern coast of Belem, which serves as a haven for piracy. Wayangs also live scattered in Tengah Pulu, with the island of [[Bukorang]] being exclusively theirs.
> Rendah Pulu is inhabited by demon worshippers and cannibals. The most notorious islands are [[Lakapuna]] and [[Olakapuna]], off the coast of the Valashmai Jungle, where monsters, vile [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]], and priests live and practice profane rites. Most pirates avoid Rendah Pulu, but it is rumoured that the most intact remnants of Taumata can be found here.
> Minata is also home to a surprising number of worshippers of [[Lady Nanbyo]], the goddess of disasters and so called 'Widow of Suffering'.
