> The [[Elf|elven]] land of **Hymbria** is a colony of [[Kyonin]] located in a wooded region in the southern [[River Kingdoms]], between [[Embeth Forest]] and [[Gralton]]. Non-elves and even many elves from other lands are not allowed in Hymbria, thus little is known of the region outside its wooded borders. It was founded in [[2802 AR]].
> Kyonin has long desired to reclaim the human-occupied elven ruin of [[Sevenarches]] in the River Kingdoms and has established Hymbria toward that end. Kyonin's control over this outpost has been growing increasingly tenuous in recent years due to populating Hymbria mainly with malcontents and other undesirables.
