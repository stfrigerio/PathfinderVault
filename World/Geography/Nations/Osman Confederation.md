> The **Osman Confederation** is a loose alliance of [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] villages in the interior of the [[Crown of the World]], centered on Lake Buriyiim. The semi-nomadic Osman Erutaki spend the summer months tending their caribou herds on the tundra and return to their villages during the winter. The confederation's governing body is an assembly of speakers representing each village who meet in the trade town of [[Jaagiin]].
