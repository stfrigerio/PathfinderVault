## History


### Thassilonian Empire


 [[Xin-Shalast]], lost city of [[Thassilon]] in Varisia.
> Over 10,000 years ago, much of modern-day Varisia was ruled by one of the earliest [[Human|human]] civilizations on the [[Avistan|Avistani]] mainland, the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian Empire]]. Formed by [[Azlant|Azlanti]] exiles, and ruled by the [[Runelords|runelords]], [[Wizard|wizards]] of tremendous power who practised [[Sin magic|sin magic]], this nation built enormous stone monuments to its own vanity using [[Giant|giant]] slave labor. The Thassilonians were also served by the indigenous [[Human|humans]], whom they divided into two castes: the militia and the providers. The militia were trained in martial techniques to serve in the nation's armies, while the providers worked as farmers, craftspeople, miners, and mystics.
> Already weakened by corruption and warfare, Thassilon quickly crumbled during the destruction and chaos brought on by [[Earthfall]]. The runelords, having foreseen this apocalypse, hid in numerous protected sanctuaries to escape death, entering a deep sleep in which most still lie.
> The [[Elf|elven]] city of [[Celwynvian]] in western Varisia's [[Mierani Forest]] was also abandoned just before the impact of the [[Starstone]]. Its inhabitants, along with all the other elves of the [[Inner Sea region]], left [[Golarion]] for their realm of [[Sovyrian]].


### Age of Darkness

> With the runelords powerless and slumbering, the surviving people of Varisia were left to create their own destiny. The human militia caste broke into clans and eventually developed into the [[Shoanti]] people, who began settling all over modern-day Varisia. The provider caste transformed into what are known today as [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisians]], from whom the land takes its current name, and took on a more nomadic lifestyle.
> It was also during this time that the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] emerged on the surface at the completion of their [[Quest for Sky]]. They established the [[Sky Citadel]] of [[Janderhoff]] in the western [[Mindspin Mountains]].


### Chelish expansion

> Thousands of years passed, and the land and peoples became more stable; the Shoanti battled giants and [[Orc|orcs]], while native Varisians roamed across the region and spread out across Avistan. Varisia itself was largely ignored by the empires of the south because it was simply too far away, while the Jarls of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] preferred to raid further south, as Varisia lacked any major coastal settlements.
> This came to an end during the period of rapid [[Cheliax|Chelish]] expansion, known as the [[Everwar]]. Southern exploration of the largely wilderness region began in [[4405 AR]], when Chelish colonists entered the land through [[Bloodsworn Vale]]. This sparked a war between the settlers and Shoanti that last nearly a century before the Shoanti were pushed back onto the [[Storval Plateau]] and other less desirable regions. With the native inhabitants removed from the most fertile land near the coast, Chelish colonists began to arrive in much greater numbers, under the pretense of bringing "civilization and culture" to Varisia.


### Death of Aroden

> Another upheaval occurred upon the death of [[Aroden]] and the civil war which tore apart Cheliax for decades. After the [[House Thrune]] took the throne, a large part of the population left Korvosa and founded [[Magnimar]] on the southwest corner of Varisia. These two city states have since been vying for resources, though not openly warring, while the Shoanti grow strong, and ready for war in the north.


## Geography

> Varisia is a vast frontier region in the northwest of [[Avistan]]. It stretches from the [[Steaming Sea]] in the west to the [[Mindspin Mountains]] in the east and from the [[Kodar Mountains]] to [[Conqueror's Bay|Conquerors Bay]] in the south. The region possesses a variety of environments within its limits, from the swampy [[Mushfens]] of the south to the flame-scorched [[Cinderlands]] on the northern [[Storval Plateau]].

### Thassilonian ruins


> Countless gigantic monuments and buildings left over from ancient Thassilon can be found across Varisia. They have survived for over ten millennia due to the skills of their [[Stone giant|stone giant]] crafters and the power infused in them by the runelords. The most well-known of these include the [[Cyphergate]] of Riddleport, the [[Irespan]] of Magnimar, the [[Grand Mastaba]] of Korvosa, and the [[Lady's Light|Ladys Light]] in the Mushfens.
> In the past few hundred years, the magic protecting these structures has finally begun to fail, and have slowly been suffering from the normal effects of erosion. This has also made them more vulnerable to explorers and treasure seekers, who search for the lost treasures of their ancient owners.


### Major caravan routes

***Main article: [[Varisian caravan routes]]***
> Many of Varisia's roads have developed from ancient routes traveled by the region's Varisian wanderers. They crisscross the region and connect most of its major cities.


## Government


> Varisia has no central government. It is a collection of independent city-states that each holds sway over a small collection of towns and villages, while the wilds on the edges of their territory (including most of the area on top of the Storval Plateau) is claimed by the Shoanti. Varisian politics is dominated by the competing aims of criminal [[Riddleport]], ambitious [[Magnimar]], and traditionalist [[Korvosa]]. The neutral [[Kaer Maga]] is often discounted altogether, and its inhabitants prefer it that way.


### Korvosa and Magnimar

***Main articles: [[Korvosa]] and [[Magnimar]]***
> Korvosa is the oldest and largest of these cities, founded as a Chelish colony in the 45th century AR, and is the only one to have established a hereditary monarchy. Thousands of dissatisfied Korvosans fled to Magnimar less than a century ago, disagreeing with their mother city's allying themselves with the new, infernally-backed Chelish government. Although Magnimar had existed before, the mass influx of new citizens made it a true rival to Korvosa's economic dominance of the region.


### Riddleport

***Main article: [[Riddleport]]***
> Far to the northwest of Magnimar and Korvosa is the pirate-haven of Riddleport. It is governed by a powerful [[Gaston Cromarcky|Overlord]] who runs with a harsh, but decidedly laissez-faire attitude.


### Kaer Maga

***Main article: [[Kaer Maga]]***
> The smallest of Varisia's major cities is the unusual city of Kaer Maga, found on one of the highest parts of the [[Storval Rise]]. It exists in basically an anarchic state, with numerous smaller power groups looking after their own interests.


## Inhabitants

> Despite being a frontier, [[Human|humans]] are still the majority population in Varisia, although significant pockets of other races exist here as well. The humans are primarily of [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelaxian]], [[Shoanti]], and [[Varisian]] stock, with a fair number of [[Taldan|Taldans]], [[Ulfen]], and even [[Tien]] thrown into the mix as well.


### Dwarves

> [[Janderhoff]] (in the [[Mindspin Mountains]]) is not only the largest [[Dwarf|dwarven]] settlement in Varisia, but also where the majority of local stout folk live. There they mine and smelt the ores they dig out of the ground, but can also be found throughout Varisia as underground guides and mercenaries, merchants, and hunters. Dwarven ingenuity is well-known, and is evidenced by the exotic ore processing facility called the the [[Gas Forges]], located in Riddleport.


### Half-elves

> The [[Half-elf|half-elves]] of Varisia face a lot of prejudices from both parental races, so they often prefer the harsh life in anarchic [[Riddleport]] or even an nomadic existence with the native Varisians and even the Shoanti to the life in the towns of southern Varisia. Life is especially depressive in [[Korvosa]] where they tend to be the most pitied offspring of lustful [[Mierani Forest|Mierani]] ambassador [[Perishial Kalissreavil]] and a lot of bored young noble women from the Korvosan upper class.


### Halflings

> [[Halfling|Halflings]] are a quite adaptable lot and can be found in the big cities as well as under the nomadic Varisians. Good sailors, they often came with their Chelish masters to Korvosa and make the crew of nearly half the ships belonging to Korvosa's elite. They can also be seen in [[Magnimar]] as well as in Riddleport where they often follow more shadowy ways and find great opportunities in the city's underworld.


### Half-orcs

> Many [[Shoanti]] tribes live near the [[Hold of Belkzen]] with constant skirmishes between orcs and humans. Sometimes this leads to rapes which could eventually culminate with pregnancy. Few of these [[Half-orc|half-orc]] children survive into adulthood, and fewer decide to accept the difficult cohabitation with their human cousins in some of the Varisian cities.


## Flora and fauna

> Varisia is home to a wide variety of plant-life and creatures, given its extremes in environments and geography. It is also known as a "frontier" or "wild" region, with many dangerous monsters living in relatively close proximity to Varisia's settlements. These include such creatures as [[Black Magga]], known to dwell in the waters of the [[Storval Deep]] north of the village of [[Turtleback Ferry]], the seldom-seen [[Sandpoint devil]], and such mythical creatures as the [[Oliphaunt of Jandelay]]. In addition, Varisia is home to a number of larger non-human populations. The most common of these are the [[Goblin|goblins]], who dwell here in larger numbers than almost anywhere else in the Inner Sea region, although [[Aasimar's Mercy|aasimars]] are a significant minority as well.


### Dragons

> Although [[Dragon|dragons]] have dwelt in Varisia since time immemorial, until recently they have had few clashes with the more civilized races. As the humanoid population centers grow and expand into the wilderness, so do the encounters with dragons.


### Giants

> The runelords of Thassilon exploited the expertise and power of giants in order to build their Brobdingnagian monuments and buildings. Thousands of years later, countless giant races still inhabit Varisia in great numbers, although most have retreated to the less-civilized regions atop the [[Storval Plateau]]. These include the [[Hill giant|hill giants]] of the [[Gnashers]] and the [[Iron Peaks]], and the [[Stone giant|stone giants]] of the Iron Peaks.


#### Ogres

> The [[Ogre|ogres]] of Varisia are among the most notorious in all of the Inner Sea region. Their destructive tribes serve as a type of buffer between the civilized races of the lower plains and the giants of the Storval Plateau. As civilization slowly expands in Varisia, it is only a matter of time before ogres are pushed into open warfare, but for now they are happy arguing and fighting amongst each other.
