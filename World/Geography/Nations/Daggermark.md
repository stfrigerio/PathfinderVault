> The largest city in all of the [[River Kingdoms]], **Daggermark** has maintained enough stability to control an abundant supply of food, a rarity in this unstable region of [[Avistan]]. Daggermark is so stable that it even has a thriving industry and is wealthy enough to mint its own [[Currency|coin]]. The main reason for this stability are the two guilds for which the city is so famous: the [[Daggermark Assassins' Guild|Daggermark Assassins Guild]] and the [[Daggermark Poisoners' Guild|Daggermark Poisoners Guild]]. These two organizations often work hand in hand, as the [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|assassins]] favor the use of [[Poison|poisons]], believing that only amateurs leave behind an obvious cause of death. Few bandit lords would be stupid enough to attack Daggermark for fear of being found poisoned, strangled, or having succumbed to some other seemingly "accidental" death.



## Defenses

> Even if someone were foolish enough to risk the wrath of its assassins, Daggermark is still far from undefended.  It has the largest army in all the River Kingdoms and the city itself boasts both an inner and outer wall.


## Government

> The most powerful and prestigious members of Daggermark society live within the inner wall (called Dagger Keep by the locals), including the ruler, [[Martro Livondar]]. Rule of the city is more complicated than it appears: while Marto Livondar in theory controls the city, he would not be able to do so without the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] warrior Jallor Clovesh who controls the army.  In addition, if Livondar were ever to lose the favor of [[Janna Smilos|Lady Smilos]], the head of the assassins' guild, or [[Tragshi]], head of the poisoners' guild, it is unlikely he would survive more than a week.
> Daggermark is the annual host of the [[Outlaw Council]], the contentious meeting where the most powerful leaders in the River Kingdoms come together to discuss defending their freedom against external threats.


## Inhabitants

*See also: [[CategoryDaggermarkInhabitants]]*
> Daggermark is one of the main, albeit small, [[Halfling|halfling]] settlements in the Inner Sea Region, being a beacon for freed [[Slavery|slaves]] due to the [[River Freedoms]]. Many halflings use their size and stealth to advantage as members of the city's Assassins' Guild and Poisoners' Guild. Daggermark is also home to many [[Vishkanya|vishkanyas]], ophidian people more commonly found in [[Casmaron]] who have a natural affinity for poison. Unsurprisingly most vishkanyas find work with either the Daggermark Poisoners' or the Daggermark Assassins' Guilds.
