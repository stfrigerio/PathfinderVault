> The **Khorkii Clans** are a loose confederation of [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] humans who live along the shores of the [[Gulf of Khorkii]]. The clans sometimes trade with the people of [[Hongal]] in the summer months; but, during the long northern winter, they hole up in their stone delvings under the [[Wall of Heaven]] mountains. These halls are maintained by the large number of [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who reside amongst the Khorkii. The chief Khorkii settlement is the town of [[Ketskerlet]].
