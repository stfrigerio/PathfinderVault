*This is an article on the nation of Geb. For information on the person of the same name, see [[Geb person]].*
> A kingdom forged during the [[Age of Destiny]] by a [[Necromancer|necromancer]] of incredible power and insidious vision, **Geb** is now renowned as a land of the [[Undead|undead]], and while plantations filled with [[Zombie|zombie]] labourers may stick in the mind, there is much, much more to Geb.



## History

> During the zenith of [[Osirion]], the land that would become Geb was the southernmost part of its territory. As Osirion's power declined, the [[Pharaoh|pharaohs]] ceded control of the land to the the exiled Osiriani necromancer [[Geb (person)|Geb]] in [[-929 AR]].


### War with Nex

> Until the coming of the archmage [[Nex (person)|Nex]], Geb was a reasonably peaceful nation. In -892 Ar, Nex's expansion southward into Geb ignited the most infamous magical rivalry in [[Golarion|Golarions]] history as Geb plunged the land into war with neighbouring [[Nex]] (named in honour of the nation's archmage ruler). During one of the most deadly exchange of spell power, the necromancer Geb sucked the life from most of the land surrounding the cities of neighbouring Nex by the use of *wishes*. In return, Nex blighted the lands of Geb with a series of cataclysms that decimated the population. Geb responded by animating casualties into legions of the walking dead, beginning Geb's reliance on undead.
> After another vicious attack in [[576 AR]], Nex vanished into the [[Refuge of Nex]]; to date no trace has been found of him. Geb knew that Nex was still alive, and was distraught that he did not get to vanquish his centuries-old rival. After several decades living in resentment, his torment grew unbearable and he committed ritual suicide in [[632 AR]]. However, it was to no avail, as Geb's rage, disappointment, and necromantic connections led to him returning as a [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]] and dooming him to continue an undead existence until he can be sure of his old rival's fate.


### Land of the Undead

> With its ruler now an immortal ghost, and much of the populace animated as [[Skeleton|skeletons]] and [[Zombie|zombies]], the land of Geb became known as a land of undead, much to the dismay of neighbouring and not-so-neighbouring nations. The land was forced to fight off countless raids and naval attacks.
> The raid with the most long-lasting implications was carried out by the [[Knights of Ozem]], seeking to add to their glory following the conclusion of the [[Shining Crusade]]. Their attack failed, and Geb was so incensed that people from so far away would choose to launch an unprovoked attack on his kingdom, that he animated six of the fallen knights as [[Graveknight|graveknights]]. He ordered his new undead minions to travel to [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] in order to retrieve the corpse of [[Arazni]], the revered former [[Herald|herald]] of the god [[Aroden]] as well as the Knights' patroness. They were successful, and Geb took a year and a day to drag Arazni's soul back from the [[Great Beyond]]. Over a period of years, Geb corrupted her into a lich with none of her former personality. Geb made Arazni into his trophy wife and forced her to rule his nation in his name, something which he saw as beneath him.
> In [[4719 AR]], after Arazni escaped from Geb's clutches while Geb himself became convinced of Nex's imminent return, he returned to active rulership of his kingdom.


## Geography

> Geb is located in southern [[Garund]] and is as far south as many [[Avistan|Avistani]] maps of Garund extend. It is bordered to the west by the [[Shattered Range]] of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] while to the south the [[Field of Maidens]] serves as a permanent tribute to Geb's personal sorcerous power. To the north Geb touches the magic blasted [[Mana Wastes]], the lasting scar of the ancient war between Geb and [[Nex (person)|Nex]]. Finally to the east, the land of Geb meets the pure blue expanse of the Obari Ocean.

## Society

![[Geb_procession.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A procession of the undead in the streets of Mechitar.
> At one time, most of the inhabitants of Geb were [[Human|humans]] of [[Garundi human ethnicity|Osiriani]] descent. Countless numbers died in the war with Nex, and were reanimated as undead. After Geb himself became a ghost, undead became more and more prominent in society. Today, the majority of inhabitants are undead, and living creatures sometimes willingly accept transformation into undead as a mark of fealty to their ruler. The only living creatures with any significant influence over the affairs of the nation are Geb's powerful necromancers. Their ability to create and control undead gives them a highly specialized influence over the functioning of local society. Over the millennia, Geb has become one of, if not the preeminent center for the study of necromancy, and is widely believed to hold [[Golarion]]'s most comprehensive collection of necromantic lore.
> Gebbite society in general is divided into three caste: the quick (the living, apart from thralls), the dead (intelligent undead), and chattel (living thralls bred as food, and mindless undead). The quick and the dead are treated equally, while the chattel have no rights. Relations between the quick and the dead are regulated by the [[Dead Laws]], which are designed to ensure that the rights and security of both groups are protected. Of course, as with all nations, not everyone follows the law — visitors still need to be cautious.
> Anyone who dies on Gebbite soil is reanimated as a mindless undead creature to serve the state in eternal bondage. Those with sufficient clout or wealth generally circumvent this procedure, and willingly transform themselves into an intelligent undead creature, either through dark magics, or simply by letting themselves be killed by [[Ghoul|ghouls]], [[Vampire|vampires]], or other creatures with the ability to create such progeny. This act is seen as a great service to the state, although it does create a large population of lesser intelligent undead who see themselves as vastly superior to their unintelligent brethren, yet lack any true power.
> Corporeal undead in Geb sometimes coat their flesh in *[[Unguent of revivification|unguent of revivification]]* to maintain the appearance of life.


## Government

> The necromancer [[Geb (person)|Geb]], despite now being a ghost, remains the head of state. He rarely manifests before the people, and is bound by the curse which holds him in the mortal realm to stay within the borders of the country. For many centuries, he had Arazni rule his kingdom in his stead before returning to active rulership in 4719 AR.
> The country's more mundane day-to-day affairs are managed by the [[Blood Lord|Blood Lords]], an aristocracy of sixty powerful living and undead necromancers. Powerful vampires, [[Mummy|mummies]], [[Mohrg|mohrgs]], [[Wraith|wraiths]], [[Shadow|shadows]], and liches are counted among their number. The chief Blood Lord is the vampire [[Kemnebi]], who holds the office of chancellor.
> The lesser nobility consists of undead creatures such as mohrgs, [[Wight|wights]], [[Shadow|shadows]] and ghouls. They put on all the airs and graces of aristocracy, but are despised by the true aristocrats of the Blood Lords.
> Geb's laws prohibit channeling [[Positive energy|positive energy]], which effectively outlaws [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|good-aligned]] [[Divine|divine]] spellcasters.


### Foreign relations

> Geb is not interested in war, even with Nex. Instead, it adopts a patient and subtle approach to international relations. The war with Nex ended millennia ago, and whilst the two nations are not exactly friends, they are bound together by mutual trade. The nation also maintains good relations with [[Jalmeray]], [[Katapesh]] and [[Qadira]]. It has little to do with the [[Mwangi Expanse]], relying on the protection of the [[Shattered Range]] to keep its threats at bay. Geb's only real enemy is [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], far to the north – they have neither forgiven nor forgotten the theft of Arazni.


## Economics

> Geb's lush climate combined with warm winds from the [[Obari Ocean]] creates lush grassland in Geb, allowing crops to prosper. The fields are mainly worked by mindless undead, and foodstuffs are Geb's major export. With relatively few living citizens to feed, these are traded with [[Nex]] in return for rare components and luxury goods. They also trade food to [[Alkenstar]], in return for the city state's [[Alcoholic beveragesAlkenstar Ice Wine|ice wine]], which is a favourite of Geb's nobility. Geb also exports to nations throughout the Inner Sea.
> As a mark of friendship, the nation makes an annual gift of corpses and slaves to the [[Ghoul|ghoul]] city of [[Nemret Noktoria]], situated in the [[Darklands]] beneath [[Osirion]].
