> **Diguo-Dashu** is also known to many as the **Empire of the Rat** or the **Empire of the Rats**, though in reality "empire" is probably too organised a title for this chaotic region. Rather than being unified, the [[Ysoki|ratfolk]] of Diguo-Dashu have warred amongst themselves for countless generations. Nevertheless, Diguo-Dashu is one of [[Golarion|Golarions]] most populous ratfolk centres. Diguo-Dashu stretches across wide swathes of the [[Darklands]] level of [[Sekamina]] located below the continent of [[Tian Xia]].


## History

> For many on the surface, Diguo-Dashu is most famous for its war with [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]] in [[4251 AR]], when the ratfolk managed to conquer over a dozen cities before being beaten back by Lung Wa's formidable armies and permanently pacified by the legendary [[Archmage|archmage]] [[Hao Jin]].
