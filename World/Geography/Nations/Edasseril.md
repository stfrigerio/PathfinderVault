> **Edasseril** (pronounced eh-DASS-ur-ill), the Realm of Envy, was one of the seven nations that formed the ancient empire of [[Thassilon]]. More recently, Edasseril is the name of a region within the nation of [[New Thassilon]].


## History

> The land of Edasseril was rich in resources like timber, [[Gemstone|gemstones]], and [[Iron|iron]], as well as in [[Animal|animal]] resource with herds of wild [[Aurochs|aurochs]] and [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horses]] roaming the country. Edasseril even had a decent supply of [[Giant|giants]] to [[Slavery|enslave]]. The land did have its problems, however: from Edasseril's verdant forests came a constant stream of raiders, varying from [[Elf|wild elves]] to [[Ettercap|ettercaps]], and even hulking [[Ettin|ettins]].
> Despite its many resources, Edasseril was a nation of bitter rivalries and substance-less vanity. Even though the few remaining documents from the [[Age of Legend]] speak of it as a utopia where nothing went wrong; this was far from the truth. The domain's byzantine bureaucracy was full of envious and backstabbing officials more concerned with their own advancement than effectively managing the affairs of the nation.
> This realm's original name is unknown; in [[-6475 AR]], the first runelord of envy [[Naaft]], who looked to the local elven kingdom of [[Mierani]] and its elves' beauty with characteristic envy, took the family name of the loveliest elven princess to be the name of her domain.
> At the time of its fall, Edasseril was ruled by [[Runelord]] [[Belimarius]], who maintained her capital at [[Xin-Edasseril]]. During [[Earthfall]], Edasseril was destroyed by rising oceans.


## Modern Edasseril

> Edasseril now exists as a region in the nation of New Thassilon. It consists of [[Peridot Isle]], the deserted southern half of the [[Ironbound Archipelago]], and the [[Mierani Forest]]. It is still ruled by Belimarius, who continues to be poisoned by the sting of envy, despite mercy and understanding from those who could have destroyed her.
