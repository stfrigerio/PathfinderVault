> The realm known as **Razmiran** (pronounced RAZZ-meer-ann) was once a turbulent, violent [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] called the [[Arch-Duchy of Melcat]], where leadership changed as often as the years. This ended in [[4661 AR]], when the land was conquered by [[Razmir]], a petty tyrant masquerading as a [[God|god]].



## Government

> Razmiran is a realm devoted to its tyrannical ruler, Razmir, who claims he is a living god. He asserts that he achieved his divinity by passing the [[Test of the Starstone]] and now claims Razmiran as his own. Unbeknownst to many of the inhabitants of his theocracy, this is a lie. Razmir is little more than a powerful arcanist who feels no remorse in tricking an entire population into venerating him as an all-powerful god with the help of his chief lieutenants, colloquially called the Visions. 
> Gold-masked priests who have achieved the rank of Vision of the Fifteenth Step perform the day-to-day running of the country. These priests come from all walks of life: some are fierce warriors, while others are powerful [[Wizard|wizards]]. As they are all dressed identically, most citizens obey them without question; many are vicious sadists with a lust for power, looking for an excuse to victimize the downtrodden. The rank of Mask of the Twelfth Step is the second-highest rank in the Razmiri priesthood and wear silver masks.
> Despite having little to do with the country's daily operation, Razmir's erratic proclamations are always enforced. Razmir issues these commands from a thirty-one-stepped throne, with each step supposedly representing one of the stages Razmir went through to achieve divinity. Atop this throne he hides his ageing form behind an ornate ivory mask, and grows more power-hungry every year.


### Foreign relations

> Razmiran has poor relations with all three of the nations that border it. To the north lies haunted [[Ustalav]], to the south the [[Elf|elven]] haven of [[Kyonin]], and to the east the River Kingdoms to which Razmiran once belonged. It also has poor relations with nearby [[Brevoy]], which detests Razmir's priests due to their reputation for spreading dissent wherever they go.
> The River Kingdom of [[Lambreth]] lies very close to the theocracy of Razmiran, and this proximity has brought about a particularly violent history between the two nations as Razmiran seeks to expand its land and influence in the River Kingdoms through conversion. Razmiran nevertheless maintains small embassy-temples in several of the River Kingdoms. The Razmiri also launch raids into Kyonin in an attempt to punish perceived elven heresy and remain a constant thorn in the elves' side. The faith of Razmir was made illegal in Ustalav soon after the nation was founded. Despite later claiming hundreds of acres of land in southern [[Varno]], Razmiri missionaries soon became the victims of numerous unexplained disappearances among their numbers. Discovery of bloodless corpses followed soon after, deterring future immigration and making the Razimiran's understandably nervous of their northern neighbour.
> Before its fall, the rulers of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] kept a close eye on Razmir and his clergy, not wanting its citizens to become distracted from their primary mission of watching the [[Hold of Belkzen]] and the prison of the [[Whispering Tyrant]]. After Lastwall's collapse, an agreement was made with the newly empowered [[Tar-Baphon]] that guaranteed mutual non-interference between Razmiran and the [[Gravelands]]. It is rumored, however, that Razmiri corpses are given over to the [[Undead|undead]] lord to feed his legions as part of this arrangement. This has not caused undo concern among the citizens of Razmiran, as many of the bodies come from the prison mine called the [[Forgotten Track]], and the Church of Razmir has long declared the bodies of the dead as taboo and unclean.


## History

> Razmiran's history is a short tale, as it is among [[Avistan|Avistans]] youngest nations, and begins when Razmir first appeared in the region in 4661 AR, first stopping in the city of [[Xer]] near the shores of [[Lake Encarthan]]. He then moved on to the River Kingdom known as the Arch-Duchy of Melcat, where he began ousting the local magistrate and the parasitic trade guilds. Little did the people of Melcat know that he murdered the magistrate and incorporated the thieving trade guilds into the priesthood of his new religion.
> Razmir's popularity slowly grew until he controlled much of Melcat. Soon, the only part of the old duchy that was not under his control was its capital, [[Aerduin]]. Razmir went to Aerduin himself on 17 [[Erastus]] and made three requests of fealty to the [[Melcat person|Duke of Melcat]], all of which were rebuked. That night Razmir [[Magic/Conjuration|conjured]] a terrible cloud of burning fire and obscuring smoke that descended upon the city. The screams of the dying echoed all night long, and by morning the city was naught but ash and ruin. Since then, the nation of Razmiran has expanded its border on five separate occasions, each time at the expense of a neighbouring River Kingdom or the country of [[Ustalav]].


## Geography

> Situated between the eastern shore of the [[Lake Encarthan]] and the western-most of the River Kingdoms, Razmiran is not a particularly large country when compared to the great nations of the [[Inner Sea region]] like [[Andoran]] or [[Taldor]]. It is, however, a huge country when compared to the River Kingdoms to the east. Considering that Razmiran began as a small River Kingdom, its current size—after only sixty years of existence—is considerable, and few would deny that Razmir's conquests are impressive. The biggest geographical feature of Razmiran is the [[Exalted Woods]] in the center of the country. A [[First Step|secret fortress]] devoted to the worship of Razmir lies at the center of the woods, giving the place a fell reputation.
> The [[Glass River]] is the most notable river of the region, which runs through southern Razmiran before emptying into Lake Encarthan.

## Inhabitants

> The inhabitants of Razmiran live much like any other peasants slaving beneath a tyrant's harsh rule. The only difference is that those who speak ill of Razmir are not executed as traitors, but instead burned as heretics and heathens. Religion plays a larger role in daily life than it does in other states, as it is the state's main tool of control. The worship of any god other than Razmir is banned, and few dare to tempt the wrath of his faithful by criticizing this policy.


### Tieflings

> A small colony of [[Shackleborn|shackleborn]] [[Tiefling|tieflings]] live in Razmiran, trained from youth to serve the will of the clergy. It is believed that these are the offspring of [[Velstrac|velstrac]] torturers, employed to persuade doubtful acolytes. However, the Razmiran priests have never confirmed any such dealings with the [[Evil|evil]] [[Outsider|outsiders]].


## Church of Razmir

***Main article: [[Church of Razmir]]***
> Religion plays a large, often detrimental part in every aspect of Razmiri citizens' lives. The priests of Razmir have oversight over every part of society, acting more as enforcers than spiritual guides, and even the poorest laborer must tithe a portion of his meager income to the priesthood in what is known as the Tithing Step. While everyone else is forced to pay extortionate taxes, the priests of Razmir live lives of luxury and comfort. This lifestyle leads many of Razmiran's people to aspire to join the priesthood—regardless of their religious beliefs or their doubts about Razmir's divinity—as it seems to be the easiest path to wealth. Every year, hundreds of doubters are sent to the heart of the [[Exalted Wood]] to be indoctrinated into Razmir's faith. Those who return come back changed; they seem to lose their niggling doubts and return with a new-found faith, and many return with unexplained burns and scars, although some never return at all. Whispers of the foul rituals that may take place in the depths of the Exalted Woods spread rumors of magic that can bend people's minds or warp their [[Soul|souls]].


### Temples

> Razmir's temples are located in every Razmiri village and market square, but also have spread into several nearby River Kingdoms, [[Molthune]], [[Nirmathas]], and Ustalav. The governments of [[Druma]], Kyonin, and [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] have banned his worship and forbid his clergy from proselytizing. Most churches are quite simple affairs with a large central worship chamber arranged around a set of steps that lead up to a gold or silver mask.
