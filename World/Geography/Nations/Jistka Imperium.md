> The **Jistka Imperium** (pronounced JIHST-kuh) was the first [[Human|human]] kingdom to establish itself in the [[Inner Sea region]] after the centuries of darkness and devastation caused by [[Earthfall]]. Its citizens spoke a nearly forgotten language called [[Jistka language|Jistka]], whose alphabet became the basis of the alphabets of the modern languages of [[Skald language|Skald]], [[Varisian language|Varisian]], and [[Taldane]].



## History

***Main article: [[History of Jistka Imperium]]***
> The Jistka Imperium ruled over north-western [[Garund]] from the early years of the [[Age of Anguish]] (*ca.* [[-4120 AR]]), through the first 700 years of the [[Age of Destiny]]. At is height (in ca. [[-3500 AR]]) it dominated all of northwestern [[Garund]] and also parts of southwestern [[Avistan]]. This is evidenced in the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] cities of [[Westcrown]] and [[Corentyn]], where some of the deepest and oldest ruins are clearly of Jistkan design.
> One of the first documented sightings of a [[Spawn of Rovagug]], the festering [[Ulunat]], was recorded in [[-3729 AR]]. Accounts tell that six of Jistka's finest legions were sent to combat "a sky-filling darkness that flies on four hellish wings, vomiting always death". The fate of these legions is unknown, although they certainly did not destroy the monstrosity.
> Weakened by raids of desert nomads and attacks by powerful [[Outsider|outsiders]] from *ca.* [[-3300 AR]] onwards, and the lack of a strong eastern trade route, led to the slow decline of Jistka. The newly-risen kingdoms of [[OsirionHistory|Ancient Osirion]] and the [[Tekritanin League]] were simply easier for Jistka's eastern trade partners to reach.
> In addition to the economic pressure put on Jistka by its eastern neighbors, came their eventual military push for expansion. Osirion, then a burgeoning kingdom under the control of the powerful [[Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues]] pushed westward, forming an alliance with the Tekritanin League. Together, they overthrew already weakened Jistka, and the Imperium was plunged into numerous succession wars around [[-'64 AR]], from which it was never again able to recover its former political, military, and economic power. Because of this military and economic defeat, the important cultural, magical, and technological advances of the Jistka Imperium were largely lost and forgotten.


## Culture

> Little is known of these truly ancient people, as time has erased most remnants of this once great culture, although it is assumed that they were of the [[Garundi human ethnicity|Garundi]] ethnicity. At their height, the people of the Jistka Imperium were known for their great mechanical aptitude, which they overwhelmingly used to conquer other, less advanced, peoples. As the first human civilization to reemerge during the [[Age of Anguish]], they brought the advances of culture back to the primitive peoples of Garund and Avistan, showing the way for others to follow.
> They are known to have used magically controlled [[Bulette|bulettes]] as part of their armed forces. After the decline of the Imperium, these creatures simply reverted to their wild state and still plague that land.


## Jistkan ruins

> Little remains of this truly ancient empire, having been lost to the passing years, the sands of the desert, or by adoption by other cultures. Few actual ruins remain, although most that do can be found in the modern nation of [[Rahadoum]]. They carry such names as the [[Hanging City of Teskra]], [[Lost Yemal]], and the [[Tomb of Emperors]]. Ruins in Avistan are extant but less common, and include the remnants of the ancient temple-forge [[Rachikan]] in southwestern Cheliax at the delta of the [[Maiestas River]], and the coastal ruins of [[Nicyruse]] near to the modern city of [[Hinji]].


## Modern-day influence

> When [[Aligois Thels]] reorganised the [[Hellknight|Hellknights]], he based their ranks and organisation on the legions of Jistka.
