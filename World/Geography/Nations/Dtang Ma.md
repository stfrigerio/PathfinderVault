> Conquered by [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]] only 20 years before its ultimate collapse, **Dtang Ma** is a nation in southern [[Tian Xia]] ruled by a confederation of five powerful [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]]. Each is tied to one of the four traditions of sorcerous power:

> - [[Magic]] from the storms.
> - Magic from the [[Fey|fey]].
> - Magic from [[Music|music]].
> - Magic from the [[Star|stars]].
> A fifth then rules above those four, sitting on the Cinnamon Throne in the capital of [[Ramparassad]]. The Cinnamon Throne grants powers to this ruler that combine the powers of the four traditions mentioned above.
> The people of Dtang Ma believe that magic is the best means of maintaining peace and fostering knowledge, and the many rare substances found in its jungles lead to many [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemists]] adventuring in the country.

## History

> Dtang Ma was founded in [[3223 AR]] by five sisters, each of whom was a powerful sorcerer but also drew their power from a different source: the fey, the stars, storms and music. This tradition of rulership has continued ever since, although the kingdom has not always remained independent. In [[4432 AR]], the empire of [[Lung Wa]] began the first of its conquest attempts, which not only failed but indirectly resulted in the death of Lung Wa's emperor at the time. Just over fifty years later, Lung Wa would march again: in [[4480 AR]], the Seven Year War began. In [[4487 AR]], Dtang Ma finally surrendered to the conquering forces of Lung Wa, bringing the Seven Year War to an end. In [[4599 AR]], the [[Volcanic|volcanic]] Mount Pho-Yim exploded and devastated the country; many blamed Lung Wa's influence for this destructive event.
