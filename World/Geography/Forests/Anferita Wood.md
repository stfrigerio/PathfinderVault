> The **Anferita Wood** is the southwestern-most forest in the nation of [[Cheliax]] located just north of the port city of [[Corentyn]].


## Inhabitants

> A number of [[Yeth hound|yeth hound]] packs hunt in the southern part of the wood, having found their way there from the [[Great Beyond]]. They occasionally terrorize the farms and vineyards north of Corentyn, and their howls can be heard in the city as well, much to the amusement of the local [[Devil|devils]]. Two prides of [[Manticore|manticores]], loyal servants of the Chelish naval officer [[Frazura Antelo]], also live within the Anferita Wood, roaming through the forest when not serving him directly.
> The Anferita is also the birthplace and home of [[Tregellus Aranega]], the blind Grand Druid of the [[Green Faith]]. He frequently leaves the wood to confer with other Great Druids and Archdruids throughout [[Golarion]].
