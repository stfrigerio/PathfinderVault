> The **Ashwood** is a large [[Varisia|Varisian]] forest bounded to the west by the [[Skull River]], to the north by the sheer face of the [[Storval Rise]], and to the south by [[Lake Syrantula]].  It also forms the western border of the domain claimed by the city-state of [[Korvosa]]. It has one of the darkest reputations of any woodland in Varisia, and is said to be haunted by [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] and [[Werewolf|werewolves]], including the ghost of a werewolf named Loper. Because of this, the [[Erastil|Church of Erastil]] patrols the borders of the forest regularly to make sure that none of these terrors can escape to torment the neighboring towns and hamlets. The Ashwood is bordered to its west by the [[Kreegwood]] and [[Claybottom Lake]], upon whose shores lies the small town of [[Turtleback Ferry]].
