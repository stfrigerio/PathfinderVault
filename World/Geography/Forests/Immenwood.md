> The **Immenwood** is a large forest on the [[Isle of Kortos]] just south of the [[Kortos Mounts]] and north and northwest of the city of [[Absalom]].



## Geography

> The interior sections of the Immenwood are older and wilder than its edges, especially to the east, where the [[Necromancy|necromantic]] emanations of the [[Tyrant's Grasp|Tyrants Grasp]] twist the trees.


## Inhabitants

> The Immenwood holds many active settlements, the largest of which are the towns of [[Meravon]] and [[Otari]]. It also includes several mines and fortresses, both active and abandoned. The trails between the forest's towns and villages are patrolled by the [[First Guard|First Guards]] [[Eagle Garrison]].
> The [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaur]] tribes of the Immenwood are more hospitable to [[Human|humans]] than the tribes of the [[Scrape]], although tension between them and the city of Absalom has been quite poor recently.
> The wilder parts of the woodland are home to strange [[Fey|fey]] and a large number of carnivorous [[Plant|plants]].


## Lumber industry

> The center of Absalom's thriving lumber industry is the bustling town of [[Meravon]] in the western Immenwood. Wood harvested there is transported via the [[Deluge River]] to the town of [[Diobel]], or overland to [[Otari]] and from there is shipped out to world. The growth of the trees was once supercharged by the Old Forest Aeon Tower, but since the death of [[Aroden]] more than a century ago, the local lumber barons of the [[Kortos Consortium]] have been looking to [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] to help boost it.
