*For another meaning of "Backar", please see Backar.*
> The **Backar Forest** is a large woodland region in central [[Molthune]], found between the [[Mindspin Mountains]] to the west and the [[Menador Mountains]] to the east. Over 100 miles in length, east to west, it is nearly as wide, and is bordered by the [[Nosam River]] to the south. Its reaches are home to numerous [[Fey|fey]], including [[Sprite|sprites]], [[Satyr|satyrs]], twigjacks, and [[Grig|grigs]]. Molthune's rigid, imperialistic society does not sit well with these free-willed and chaotic creatures, and their apparently random acts of theft and vandalism are a source of much irritation to Molthune's government.
> Despite being banned from the country, many members of the [[Pathfinder Society]] seek to explore the Backar Forest's fey-haunted reaches.
