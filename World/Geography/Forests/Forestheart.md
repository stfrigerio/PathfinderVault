> **Forestheart** is a powerful rift between [[Golarion]] and the [[First World]]. It is a dark glade in the ancient [[Grungir Forest]] surrounded by giant trees. In the center of the glade there is an otherworldly calm and clear pool. By observing the reflections in the water's surface a visitor could look at any place in the First World and, by leaping into the pool, he could be transported to the place the pool was reflecting. The journey is one-way and the visitor has to find another way back. A capricious and demanding [[Bestiary/Nymph|nymph]] named [[Imavajana]] guards the pool and controls the destinations.


## Inhabitants

> Forestheart is a favoured place for [[Norn|norns]] as they use the breach for travel and appreciate the lack of strangers in this place.
