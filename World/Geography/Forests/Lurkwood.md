> Situated between the [[Red Mountains|Red]] and [[Stony Mountains]] of northern [[Varisia]], the **Lurkwood** has a bizarre reputation.  It seems to have become unhinged from the normal passage of time, with trees displaying fall colors in spring, and stories of travelers venturing within, emerging much younger or older than when they entered.  Whatever the truth may be, Lurkwood is a place best avoided, and even the few locals who dwell near it make sure to lock their doors and windows at night.


## History

> The Lurkwood once was home to a large community of [[Elf|elves]] who abandoned it long ago for reasons known only to them.  It is also rumored to have been the home of Pouzel, the first [[Witchfire|witchfire]].
