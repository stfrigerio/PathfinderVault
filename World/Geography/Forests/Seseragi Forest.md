> The **Seseragi Forest** is a vast forest that sits within the [[Higashita Coast]] region of [[Minkai]], sandwiched between the [[Okaiyo Ocean]] and the Warashi River. The Seseragi Forest is said to have been home to Okirori Tomoko, a legendary hero who was able to negotiate a peace between [[Human|humans]] and the powerful [[Kami|kami lords]] of the forest. Ever since, those people brave enough to walk the forested paths of Seseragi have been granted advice in the form of visions and whispers from the resident kami.
