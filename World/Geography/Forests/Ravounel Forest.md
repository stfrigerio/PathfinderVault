Nation: Cheliax, Ravounel

> The **Ravounel Forest** is located in [[Ravounel]], between the [[Yolubilis River]] and the [[Arcadian Ocean]], and gives its name to the surrounding country. Rumors have begun to surface recently that a cult of [[Rovagug]] may be active within the wood, but no hard evidence has been found so far. Older rumours of [[Strix|strix]] and malicious [[Fey|fey]] have ensured the old forest has a dangerous reputation, and so the region has never been well populated.
> The forest was once part of the Archduchy of Ravounel, a part of Cheliax, before it seceded and became an independent nation.


## Inhabitants

> The Ravounel Forest is home to the strix of the [[Kitkasiticka tribe]], who have lived in the forest for centuries. A coven of Rovagug-worshipping [[Storm hag|storm hags]] known as the Grundlescorn sisters also settled in the forest at a later date, coming in conflict with the strix for dominance of the Ravounel Forest. Other dangerous creatures live in the forest, including several evil fey.
