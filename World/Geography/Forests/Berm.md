> The **Berm** is a miles-long stand of semi-sentient trees that defend [[Kyonin|Kyonins]] northern border with [[Razmiran]] along the [[Glass River]]. Nominally part of the northern [[Fierani Forest]], and capable of independent movement, the Berm is greatly feared by the soldiers and agents of [[Razmir]], who have never seen how it travels from place to place. Those who enter the forest are rarely seen again and their blood-soaked clothing is sometimes found downriver. The Berm's sudden morning appearance on what had been gentle plains the day before, is enough to give the stoutest Razmiri pause.


## History

> For the last 50 years, the Razmiri have been hungrily eyeing the fertile plains and lush forests of northern Kyonin. During the middle 47th century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]], they sent raiding parties south in order to annex land in the name of their god. To protect the border, a group of [[Elf|elven]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] worked together with the [[Fierani creature|Fierani]] [[Arboreal|arboreals]] to create the Berm in [[4683 AR]], and they have been mutely standing guard ever since.
