> The **Estrovian Forest** makes up a large part of central and southern [[Mendev]]. Its reputation is so fierce that few trespass under its snow-laden boughs, especially in its northern reaches.



## History

> Historically, the Estrovian Forest was used for timber and hunting. However, during the [[Mendevian CrusadesFirst Mendevian Crusade|First Mendevian Crusade]] a group of [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]], angry at the influx of foreigners, transformed a trespassing [[Andoran|Andoren]] huntsman called [[Herne Vilhaur]] into a stag-horned avenger known as a [[Herne|herne]] by calling down the [[Curses of GolarionCurse of the Winterthorn|curse of the winterthorn]]. The creature killed its creators, and then began indiscriminately killing all it found within the forestâ€”sometimes creating more of his kind in the process. These creatures are known as hernes as a result. The herne creature that was once Herne Vilhaur is said to be buried in a barrow at the foot of a tree now known as [[Herne's Oak|Hernes Oak]], an area his descendants view as sacred.


## Inhabitants

> In addition to the vicious and territorial hernes, the forest is also home to [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]] and [[Snowy owl|snowy owls]], along with a pack of apparently ghostly [[Owlbear|owlbears]] who roam it on snowy nights. The bodies of any slain owlbears disappear with the dawn. [[Werebear-kin]] are also known to inhabit the forest and are respected for their abilities as [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]] and woodland guides, and [[Taiga giant|taiga giants]] settled in the forest after being displaced by the opening of the [[Worldwound]].


## Locations of interest

> The Chapel of the Argent Shield is a temple that was once dedicated to [[Aroden]] that lies on the road between [[Kenabres]] and [[Egede]] on a remote edge of the Estrovian Forest. Originally, it was a small shrine purposed to protect against the cult of [[Deskari]] but is now enlarged, fortified, and rededicated as a temple of [[Iomedae]].
> The Severed Spiral is a circle of standing stones deep within the forest, consisting of forty-three menhirs around seven dolmens. The stones on one half of the circle are made of black, rough-hewn basalt, while those on the opposite side are of white, smooth dolomite. The circle is the only permanent holy site of the Children of Balance, an organization of religious [[Ettin|ettins]] who worship the gods that most closely embody the duality and dichotomy of an ettin's lifeâ€”especially [[Pharasma]], [[Nethys]], and [[Gozreh]].
