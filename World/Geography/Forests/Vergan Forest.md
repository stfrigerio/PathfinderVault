> The **Vergan Forest** is the smaller of the two forests in [[Razmiran]], located in the southern part of the nation between the [[Exalted Wood]] and the [[Glass River]]. During [[Razmir|Razmirs]] conquest of the the [[Melcat|Arch-Duchy of Melcat]] in the 4660s, the woodland served as a hiding and resupply location for his forces. Today it is largely abandoned, and home to vigilantes, anarchists, and outlaws wishing to live outside the control of the dictatorial government and the [[Church of Razmir]].


## Description

> [[4665 AR|Fifty years ago]], this dark and musty region served as cover for guerilla forces loyal to the powerful [[Wizard|wizard]] Razmir, while he conquered the region and mercilessly slaughtered those who refused to bend their knees. Today, those unquiet [[Soul|souls]] infuse the Vergan Forest with latent [[Psychic magic|psychic power]] with which its primary inhabitants must contend. Razmiri dissidents and anarchists alike now use the forest to hide from authorities, but they are not alone; also lurking in the forest are [[Drider|driders]], giant [[Vermin|vermin]], assorted [[Undead|undead]], and a terrible ancient power that could bring ruin upon the whole region. The woodland is strewn with crumbling structures that were not meant to last and forgotten caches of weapons and other supplies.


## Places of interest
