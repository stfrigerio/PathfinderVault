> The **Narlmarches**, also known as the **Narlmarch Woods**, bifurcate the [[Stolen Lands]]. The Narlmarches spreads across the lowlands of the region and feature craggy hills, lazy streams, deep ravines, and a great variety of trees, including oak, beech, and rushleaf.
> The region hosts a rich variety of wildlife as well, with [[Elk|elk]], rivercats (a cousin to the bobcat, with a strange sort of mossy-fur), black bears, many large rodents, boars, and brush thyclacines. Stranger still are the giant owls, [[Will-o'-wisp|will-o-wisps]], [[Owlbear|owlbears]], and aggressive vegetation. Gangs of [[Troll|trolls]] range the southern edge of the forest, closer to [[Candlemere|Lake Candlemere]], and the ruins of many bandit hideouts dot the landscape as well, leading to rumors of long lost riches and fantastic treasures.
> The kingdom of [[Mivon]] at the southern end of the Narlmarches has begin to exploit them for lumber, but a band of elves reside in that part of the forest and resist the loggers.
