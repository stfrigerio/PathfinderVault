> The **Sanos Forest** of central [[Varisia]] is the heart of the [[Gnome|gnome]] community of that land where gnomes live according to their true natures.  This large wood is located north of the [[Yondabakari River]], south of the [[Iron Peaks]] and east of the [[Malgorian Mountains]], and the gnomes who live there are quite secretive about what goes on within it.  Rumor has it that there is a direct gate to the [[First World]] of the [[Fey]], but no gnome has officially confirmed this.


## Places of Interest

> - Old Sanos Trail: This forest path winds through the Sanos connecting many of the gnome communities, and eventually leading to the [[Human|human]] town of [[Turtleback Ferry]].  Some say that the trail will magically change its path in order to redirect those who come with ill intent towards the gnomes.
> - [[Sipplerose]]: A gnome community in the Sanos Forest, known to be the home of the [[Lyrakien]] Novi.

## Lumber Industry

> Lumber from the Sanos Forest is sent down the Yondabakari River in long, flat-bottomed river barges; much of which is processed in the many mills on [[Kyver's Islet|Kyvers Islet]].
