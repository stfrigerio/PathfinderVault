> **Coreth Wood**, is a large forest in northwestern [[Iobaria]]. Despite being inhabited by bands of [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]], [[Ogre|ogres]], and [[Frost fir|frost firs]], local [[Iobarian human ethnicity|human]] artisans use Coreth's valuable woods, which they carve into valuable works of art and export to [[Brevoy]].
