> The boggy **Eshirwood** is a large woodland covering about 600 square miles in the east of the county of [[Canterwall]] in [[Ustalav]]. To its north-west is the hamlet of [[Bladswell]]; to its north runs the [[Vistear River]]; to the east lies the [[Sclerain Swamp]]; to the south-east the [[Orphield River]] flows; while, to the west, lies the large moor that is the centre of Canterwall, which extends as far as [[Lake Lias]].
> From out of this forest, a voice called a younger [[Zoenessa Thell]] while she still lived in Bladswell. The fear of this motherly call sent Zoenessa to seek her uncle in [[Tamrivena]], where she still lives today.
