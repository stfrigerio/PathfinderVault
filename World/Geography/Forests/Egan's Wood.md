> **Egan's Woods** lie along the southeast side of the [[Ashen Rise]] south of [[Sandpoint]]. Egan lived in a shack in the woods while forbidding any clearing of the land for farming. Even though Egan has passed on, the forest remains. It is currently inhabited by [[Giant spider|giant spiders]] with blue stripes on them. This brings large numbers of [[Mite|mites]] to the woods here, as having tamed one of these spiders has become a point of pride among the youths of the local tribes.
