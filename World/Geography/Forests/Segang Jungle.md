> The **Segang Jungle** is the largest woodland on the southern half of the island-nation of [[Jalmeray]]. It contains an unusual variety of plants and [[Animal|animals]] that have been brought to the island from distant [[Vudra]] by generations of travelers and [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]]. The jungle is home to numerous hunting lodges run by [[Niswan|Niswani]] businessmen who cater to the emerging interest in traditional Vudrani hunting expeditions. These organizations are known to sometimes employ unusual and unethical practices in securing their customers. The jungle also contains abandoned shrines to unknown [[Deity|gods]], and there are no known active cults here at this time.
