*For another meaning of "Whisperwood", please see [[Whisperwood]].*
> Running along most of the [[Lost Coast]], only the northern edge of the **Whisperwood** is in the [[Sandpoint]] [[Sandpoint Hinterlands|hinterlands]]. The [[Wolf|wolves]], [[Bugbear|bugbears]], and bandits make this area of majestic redwoods dangerous for those seeking out tales of the ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] states of [[Shalast]] and [[Bakrakhan]].
