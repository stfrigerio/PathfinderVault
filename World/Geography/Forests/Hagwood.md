> The forest known as Hagwood is located near the city of [[Westcrown]] in the nation of [[Cheliax]]. 
> The southern expanse of the dense woodland is located only 2 miles from Westcrown's western edge, across the waters of the [[Adivian River]] to the northeast.
> The forest has a somewhat fearful reputation among the populace of Westcrown as was the home of three [[Hag|hags]] who dwelt in the woodland's dark depths. Although two of these vile beings were recently slain, the surviving hag, known as the [[Mother of Flies]] still lurks in the forest's deepest reaches.
> The forest is a dangerous place for outsiders as it is the home of vermin, stirges, and vicious [[Fey|fey]], many of whom have allied themselves with the Mother of Flies.
