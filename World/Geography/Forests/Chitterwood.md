 [[Goblin|Goblins]] and [[Zombie|zombies]] clash in the Chitterwood.

> The **Chitterwood** is a large hardwood forest located in southern [[Isger]] between the [[Keld River|Keld]] and [[Conerica River|Conerica rivers]]. It is best known as the home of the hundreds of [[Goblinoid|goblinoid]] tribes that invaded Isger during the [[Goblinblood Wars]] ([[4697 AR|4697]]â€“[[4701 AR]]). Large parts of the forest were burned by Isgeri forces after the wars in an effort to exterminate their enemies.



## Geography

> Much of the forest was destroyed to drive out the goblins, and these scars remain evident today. Entrances to the [[Caverns of Chitterwood]] can be found throughout the woods, and most goblin tribes make their homes near them.


### Settlements

> The city of [[Logas]] is close to the edge of the forest. The city's war engines indiscriminately launch huge stones into the forest to intimidate the goblins.
> The village of [[Gillamoor]] is just a stone's throw from Chitterwood's southern edge. It has been quarantined by [[Isger]]'s army, who believe its inhabitants have been transformed into ravenous, [[Undead|undead]] creatures by an infectious plague.


### Trade route

> Most of the trade through Isger follows a path along the [[Conerica River]] known as the [[Conerica Straits]]; this route is well-patrolled by Isgeri soldiers. A lesser route passes through the Chitterwood despite the obvious dangers posed by its occupants, and tends to attract trade caravans hauling goods they'd rather keep from the authorities' prying eyes. Many of these caravans are operated by the [[Sczarni]] and came under fierce attack in [[4712 AR]] by the [[Skeleton|skeletal]] minions of Telda, a [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]] [[Oracle|oracle]] of [[Urgathoa]]. These attacks continued until a band of [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] allied with the Sczarni took down the undead mistress of the Chitterwood.


## Inhabitants

> Chitterwood's most notorious denizens are the hundreds of [[Goblin|goblin]] and [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]] tribes that still make their home there, despite the wholesale slaughter brought on by the Goblinblood Wars. They carry such names as [[True Hoard]], [[Spine Threshers]], and the [[People of the Stirge]], and are doing their best to rebuild their decimated populations. These [[Goblinoid|goblinoids]] are known to be particularly crafty and well-organized.
> It is also rumored that a dangerous [[Hodag|hodag]] has hunted here for hundreds of years. Storytellers claim that the creature is now a living shadow and that safety from the beast can only be found in sunlight.
> The blood-stained history of the forest has also made it attractive to the homicidal [[Fey|fey]] known as [[Redcap|redcaps]], who dwell in the caverns below and are said to be allied with the local goblin and hobgoblin tribes.


## Economy

> Silkworms found in the Chitterwood are cultivated to produce fine [[Silk|silk]] valued throughout [[Avistan]].
