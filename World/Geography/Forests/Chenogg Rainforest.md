> The **Chenogg Rainforest**, also known as **Motak Jungle**, is a vast untamed and deadly rainforest that dominates the northern part of the [[Motaku Isle]] in the [[Shackles]]. A number of utterly alien, vine-choked crumbling obelisks of black stone are found in the jungle. At least seven of these monuments line the [[Ravensfoot River]]'s banks. Some scholars say that these monuments may be the reason why not a single [[Ghol-Gan]] ruin has been found on Motaku. Some say that these obelisks are somehow gateways to subterranean vaults and that untold riches await whoever unlocks their secrets.
