The Mierani Forest
> The **Mierani Forest** (pronounced meer-AWN-ee) was until recently part of northwestern [[Varisia]]; it is now annexed to [[New Thassilon]]. The forest is one of the ancestral homes of the [[Elf|elves]] in [[Avistan]].



## Geography

> Situated between the [[Calphiak Mountains]] and the [[Velashu Uplands]], the Mierani Forest also borders the [[Steaming Sea]] to its north. The forest is known for its ancient, verdant fir trees, pines, and redwoods, and plentiful wildlife, gently maintained by the elves.


## Elves of the Mierani

> The elves are quite protective of the forest and go to great lengths to keep intruders out, especially lumberjacks and monsters. Although they live throughout the forest, the greatest concentrations can be found in the villages of [[Crying Leaf]], cliff-side [[Arsmeril]], and the ruins of their ancient capital, [[Celwynvian]]. The job of clearing the forest of danger after the elves' long period away from [[Golarion]] continues: they regularly battle [[Ettercap|ettercaps]] and carnivorous [[Plant|plants]], but their main target is the [[Green dragon|green dragon]] [[Razorhorn]]. Some Mierani elves are so distraught over their inability to retake their ancient city since their return, that they leave the forest to become [[Forlorn]].


## New Thassilon

> After the founding of [[New Thassilon]] in [[4718 AR]], [[Belimarius|Runelord Belimarius]] moved quickly to annex the Mierani Forest, though the elves who live there oppose this part of Edasseril's expansion.
