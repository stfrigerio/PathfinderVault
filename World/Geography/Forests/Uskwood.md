> The **Uskwood** is a large hardwood forest located entirely within the shadowy nation of [[Nidal]].  Little is known about this country, as its inhabitants do not welcome foreigners, and even less about the forest which surrounds its capital, [[Pangolais]].
> It is believed that a [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druidic]] order, all worshipers of [[Zon-Kuthon]], dwell at the heart of Uskwood. These albino druids carry with them powerful effigies of hair, twigs, and blood that each crawl with the terrible cold of the Midnight Lord's hallowed hunting grounds. They specialise in cold [[Magic|magic]], but are forbidden to evoke fire magic.
