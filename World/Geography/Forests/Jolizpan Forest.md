> The **Jolizpan Forest** is a huge forest in the northwest of [[Xopatl]] that grew up around a fragment of magic that struck the land during [[Earthfall]]. Legends claim that this shard struck a [[Chicome couatl|chicome couatl]] mid-flight causing the Jolizpan Forest to grow from the creature's body. The [[Tumbaja Mountain]] is the source of much of the magic in the Jolizpan Forest and locals utilise its power to grow unique [[Arcane magic|arcane]]-infused plants.
