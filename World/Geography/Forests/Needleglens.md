> The **Needleglens** are one of the few remaining forests left in the [[Worldwound]], seemingly unaffected by the blight or destruction that has occurred throughout the rest of the land. Located in the [[Riftshadow]] region along the [[Sarkora River]], the Needleglens are filled with thorny underbrush and twisted trees.
