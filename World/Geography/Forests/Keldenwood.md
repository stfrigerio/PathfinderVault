> The **Keldenwood** is a large woodland in the north-east of the county of [[Odranto]] in [[Ustalav]]. The mighty [[Moutray River]] acts as the wood's northern border; its eastern trees act as the border between Odranto and its neighbouring county of [[Sinaria]]. To its north, on the border of Ustalav with the [[Worldwound]], the infamous [[Castle Kronquist]] rises out of the brambles of the wood.
