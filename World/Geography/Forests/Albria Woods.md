> **Albria Woods** is a woodland in the county of [[Caliphas]] in [[Ustalav]]. To its north are the southern peaks of the [[Hungry Mountains]]; to its east runs the [[Raiteso River]]; on its murky southern edge flows the [[Droa River]], on whose southern bank lies the settlement of [[Anactoria]]; while to its west is the [[Carabosse River]].
> A legend exists that the [[Witch|witches]] of the Albria Woods attempted an alliance with the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] once the last Ustalavic king, [[Ardurras Virholt]], was defeated. They aimed to take control of the area; however, [[Tar-Baphon]] rejected their approach and routed the witches.
