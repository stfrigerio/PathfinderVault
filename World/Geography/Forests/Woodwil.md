> The **Woodwil** is the workshop of the artist [[Deveera Gadsel]] in the town of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] in [[Andoran]]. The workshop serves also as a gathering place for a number of semi-artistic locals in town.
> [[Ayda Vorshin]], a [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/half-orc|half-orc]], of the [[High Market]] sees the growing popularity of Deveera's crafts as cutting into the profits of her own import business. She has attempted to frighten Deveera into restricting her business to [[Low Market]]. The half-orc and her men have broken into Woodwil, smashing goods and injuring artisans. Deveera is trying to organize a guild to provide mutual protection from Vorshin. Thus far, [[Thuldrin Kreed]] has not intervened but he promises to crush both sides if they pose a threat to public order. Meanwhile, the [[Lumber Consortium]] is paid a share of Deveera's profits as an "administrative fee".
