> **Storith Wood** once encompassed all of [[Okor's Basin|Okors Basin]], but logging and the growth of [[Human|human]] settlements in the region, including [[Orlov]], has left the forest a shadow of its former size. The remaining woods are protected by [[Korred|korred]], [[Satyr|satyrs]], and fanatical [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] who prevent any further logging, though they will trade deadfall with neighbouring humans in return for [[Cattle|cattle]] and knowledge.
