> The **Witchgate Forest** is a large woodland that straddles the border between the [[Hold of Belkzen]] and western [[Virlych]], in [[Ustalav]]. The forest lies at the foot of the north-western [[Hungry Mountains]] and the ruins of [[Renchurch]] are in the shadows of the forest's eastern reaches. The forest is named after magical protections, called *[[Witchgate|witchgates]]* that [[Tar-Baphon]] created to protect [[Gallowspire]], his capital. Today, the incredibly dangerous forest is patrolled by soldiers from [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] and cultists of the [[Whispering Tyrant]].
