> The **Frozen Pines** is a nightmare glade in the [[Grungir Forest]] that even the [[Fey|fey]] of the forest fear to visit. This extremely frozen region consists of several dozen square miles of territory.
> The pine trees have adapted to the frost, but nothing else grows here, including any of the normal undergrowth of the forest. Frozen Pines is said to be under the control of the [[White Witch|White Witches]] of [[Irrisen]], but in truth, it serves as the hunting grounds for some very powerful [[Wendigo|wendigos]].
