> The **Palakar Forest** is located in the center of the mercantile nation of [[Druma]], between the [[Five Kings Mountains]] and the waters of [[Lake Encarthan]]. It is divided into roughly three sections by the waters of the [[Profit's Flow|Profits Flow]] and [[Great Goldpan River|Great Goldpan Rivers]], which meet at the city of [[Macridi]]. Each of the three sections is ruled by a different [[Fey|fey court]] (one which is dominated by [[Satyr|satyrs]], one by [[Bestiary/Nymph|nymphs]], and the third by [[Dryad|dryads]]). Members of each of these courts rarely travel into the territory of another, and conflict between the groups is relatively common.


## Fey relationship with Macridi

> Unlike in other logging communities, the [[Human|humans]] of Macridi do not clear cut the Palakar. Due to the influence of the [[Prophecies of Kalistrade]] that preach long-term profits above all else, the logging companies instead take a longer view. They only fell the choicest and most valuable trees, leaving most of the forest intact. This has generated so much good will with the local fey courts, that occasionally fey even act as scouts for the lumber companies, pointing out particularly impressive [[Darkwood|darkwood]] or [[Paueliel|paueliel]] trees.
