> The **Axan Wood** is [[Geb's Rest]]'s only major woodland, and can be found in the central part of that country, north of the [[Axanir River]]. It suffered badly in the magical war between [[Nex]] and [[Geb's Rest]]. The trees of this twisted forest are all either dead or [[Undead|undead]], and it is home to many strange creatures. Some, such as ghostly [[Dryad|dryads]], hate-filled [[Wolf|wolves]] and twilight unicorns, are unique to this forest.
