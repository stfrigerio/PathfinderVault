> The **Shudderwood** is one of the largest forests in northern [[Avistan]], with half of its area in [[Ustalav]] and the other half in the [[Worldwound]].



## Ustalav

> In Ustalav, the Shudderwood is infamous for its [[Wolf|wolves]] and [[Werewolf|werewolves]].


### Geography

> The Shudderwood in Ustalav is almost entirely within the county of [[Lozeri]] covering most of that county to the point that, for many, the Shudderwood and Lozeri are synonymous. There is a small part of the wood in eastern [[Vieland]]. Many rivers flow through the wood including: the [[Buestral River]], the [[Calscroix River]], the [[Mothburn]], the [[Moutray River]], and the [[Troll's Tail|Trolls Tail]]. The [[Dippelmere Swamp]] lies in the Vieland portion of the wood.

## The Worldwound

> Much of the south-western part of the Worldwound is under the canopy of the Shudderwood. Here the [[Fey|fey]] of the forest have fought against the [[Demon|demonic]] invasion: in the north they have failed, becoming [[Half-fiend|half-fiends]] or other [[Abyss|Abyssal]] monstrosities; in the south they are failing.
> The northern part of the Shudderwood is twisted and haunted. The vicious, tainted fey of the forest hate any intruder as much as they hate the demons who tainted their home; beasts have been replaced by the haunts of the [[Sarkoris|Sarkorian]] refugees murdered by the Ustalavs during the Demonskin War; and large packs of werewolves, many devoted to the demon lord [[Jezelda]] but others with allegiances to clans from the south, are fighting within the forest.
