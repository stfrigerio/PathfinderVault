> The Nettlewood is a wild woodland along the [[Lost Coast]] of southwestern [[Varisia]], between the village of [[Sandpoint]] and [[Windsong Abbey]]. Found north of the [[Lost Coast Road]], it is filled with dangerous brambles, thorns, and briars; few travelers or hunters frequent the woods. Hazards of the Nettlewood include not only stinging nettles and goblinberry patches, but the tribes of [[Goblin|goblins]] that make the forest their home. The westernmost portion of Nettlewood contains an intricate series of tunnels and rooms in the thick undergrowth created and maintained by the [[Thistletop goblins]].
