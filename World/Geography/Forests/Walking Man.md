> The **Walking Man** is a 30 foot tall tree-like construct sculpted to look like a man. It has at least 4 different trees bound together with ivy and other vines, and covered in herbs and flowers. The flowers include amaranth, bluebell, buttercup, celandine, clover, creeping bellflower, daffodil, dragon's teeth, eyebright, goldenrod, hawksbeard, hyacinth, iris, knotweed, lily, mouse-ear, mudwort, nightshade, orchid, shepherd's purse, and tansy. Most likely it was created by [[Elf|elves]], but no one remembers when or how it was made. There is an entrance in the shoulder of the construct where many have climbed and written notes inside its hulking body. One such note, from Variel Morgethai, states that the burial mound [[Erithiel's Hall|Erithiels Hall]] may somehow be connected to The Walking Man. In this room are panels that can act as controls for the construct which were tested by [[Varian Jeggare]]. On [[Midsummer|midsummer]] each year, it takes one step towards [[Erages]].
