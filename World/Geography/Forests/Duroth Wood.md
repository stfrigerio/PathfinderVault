> **Duroth Wood**, is a ancient and gnarled forest in southeastern [[Iobaria]] that shelters a number of [[Gnome|gnomish]] settlements, as well as settlers from numerous other civilized races seeking refuge. Like [[Fangard]] to the north, Duroth Wood is protected by mysterious [[Lycanthrope|lycanthrope]] [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]] and [[Hunter|hunters]] who refuse to disclose their purposes. Rumours speak of [[Treant|treants]] and other creatures who dwell within the Duroth Wood and protect it from those who would despoil it.
> Several groups of the [[Fey|fey]] creatures known as anhana dwell within the forest, where they tend to the land and encourage the woodland's growth.
