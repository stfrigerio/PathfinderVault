> The **Laughing Jungle** takes up much of southern [[Sargava]]. The [[Korir RiverTributaries|Lower Korir River]] flows past the jungle's southern edge, separating it from the [[Jungle of Hungry Trees]].
> The jungle is the home of a tribe of [[Halfling|halflings]] known as the [[Song'o|Songo]]. A number of abandoned villages within the jungle belonged to the tribe.
