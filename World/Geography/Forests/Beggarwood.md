> The **Beggarwood** used to once be known as "**Bugbear Wood**" for the [[Bugbear|bugbears]] that once inhabited it, but now is home to the destitute of [[Meratt|Meratt County]]. The Beggarwood is an old oak forest now home to approximately 50 vagrants who live within it, as the forest provides good shelter and food. It also provides easy access to the Oppara Highway where the residents of the Beggarwood create an impromptu 'beggar's market' selling what little goods they have for whatever money they can make. The local nobility consider this something of an embarrassment but, luckily, they lack the will to really do anything about it, other than occasionally sending soldiers to harass the Beggarwood's residents.
