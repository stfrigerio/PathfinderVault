> The **Ebonwall**, sometimes called the **Ebonwall Forest**, is a very large woodland in southern [[Virlych]], in [[Ustalav]]. The forest lies at the foot of the south-western [[Hungry Mountains]] while the [[Path River]] marks the forest's southern border. The north-eastern regions of the forest spill over the border of Virlych into the neighbouring county of [[Amaans]] at the southern end of the [[Ghorcha Pass]]. The forest contains some of the magical protections, called *[[Witchgate|witchgates]]*, that [[Tar-Baphon]] created to protect his capital, [[Gallowspire]].
