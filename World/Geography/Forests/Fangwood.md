> The **Fangwood** is a large forest that covers most of eastern [[Nirmathas]] as well as the western [[Gravelands]]. The Nirmathi see the Fangwood as vital to their economy as well as a hiding place for its soldiers in their ongoing fight against the forces of [[Molthune]].



## Geography

> The Fangwood is divided into a northern and southern half by the [[Tourondel River]] (which also forms the border between Nirmathas and the Gravelands). The northern portion found in the Gravelands is known as the **Northern Fangwood**, while in Nirmathas it is called the **Southern Fangwood**.
> Terrain within the Fangwood is often difficult and broken up by hills, cliffs, canyons, and large boulders. The forest itself has very thick undergrowth, and is often in perpetual twilight due to the canopy of its trees, which can reach 100 feet in height, blotting out the [[Sun|sun]]. In addition, remnants of [[Elf|elven]] [[Magic|magic]] linger in the forest, often causing its geography to change seasonally as geographic features shift, move, emerge, or vanish. Currently, much of the Fangwood remains unexplored and unmapped.


## Flora

> The forest is a mix of fir, spruce, and maple trees. The deeper reaches are often full of fir; the shadows and still air seem to cause travelers to be easily spooked. The underbrush is thickest in the spruce-dominated sections, but these areas do not cause the same feelings of fear.


## Northern Fangwood

> The northern part of the Fangwood was long avoided by Lastwall's inhabitants due to its impenetrable undergrowth and hostile fauna. As one penetrates deeper into the forest, the dangers multiply, as the central woodland is home to several tribes of [[Orc|orcs]], a [[Green dragon|green dragon]] named [[Zedoran]], and [[Redcap|redcaps]] who prey on anyone they meet.


## Southern Fangwood

> The southern half of the Fangwood provides vital cover for Nirmathi guerrilla fighters. Its [[Fey|fey]] presence is once again on the rise after the invasive [[Darkblight]] that brought an end to the seven-millennia-old [[Accressiel Court]] was defeated by Nirmathi soldiers. The southern Fangwood also remains home to a reclusive population of [[Arboreal|arboreals]], as well as to a clan of natural [[Werebear|werebears]].


## History

*See also: [[Darkblight]]*
> The Fangwood has been settled by [[Humanoid|humanoids]] for millennia. The first were the [[Elf|elves]] who discovered numerous fey and countless connections to the [[First World]] in the forest. Most left just before [[Earthfall]], either fleeing [[Sovyrian]] or through planar [[Portal|portals]] to the First World where they discovered that most of the connections to the [[Material Plane]] had closed behind them.
> Next came [[Kellid]] nomads from the north and [[Dwarf|dwarves]] from the [[Mindspin Mountains]] to the west, who both found that the forest was rich in natural resources and settled nearby. This angered the fey, who rallied behind their leader [[Gendowyn]] to repel them. She scared them off using guile and trickery, but later negotiated treaties of mutual defense and non-interference with both groups that lasted for thousands of years.
> In the end, Gendowyn's downfall came not from outside interlopers, but from her own kind. Her handmaiden [[Arlantia]], who had become a devotee of [[Cyth-V'sug|Cyth-Vsug]], the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of [[Fungus|fungus]] and parasites, overthrew and imprisoned the fey noble in [[4062 AR]]. Arlantia then released a terrible supernatural [[Disease|disease]] known as the [[Darkblight]], which spread quickly among the fey and corrupted the Fangwood. The transformed sections of the forest became known as the **Blight** and was home to debased [[Dryad|dryads]] loyal to Arlantia and who lived in dead trees. The Nirmathi fought the Darkblight for generations to protect their own settlements, and were finally able to slay Arlantia and free Gendowyn in [[4717 AR]].


## Inhabitants

> The Fangwood Forest (technically including some of the smaller woodlands surrounding it) is known to be one of the few places on [[Golarion]] where one can find [[Canopy troll|canopy trolls]], a smaller, more agile offshoot of regular [[Troll|trolls]]. The Fangwood is also one of the few forests old enough and large enough to be home to the [[Ohancanu|ohancanus]], brutish, [[Giant|giant]]-like fey that revel in destruction of civilised structures.


### Accressiel Court

> The [[Accressiel Court]] in the Southern Fangwood is once again ruled by the fey queen Gendowyn. Pockets of the Darkblight still mar the wood in numerous locations, and the fey-queen seeks allies among the Nirmathi and the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of [[Crystalhurst]] to overcome it, and to deal with the numerous [[Orc|orcs]], [[Dragon|dragons]], and other threats in the forest that murder her kind.


### Zedoran

> The great wyrm Zedoran has lived in the Fangwood for generations, and no dragonslayers have ever tracked him to his lair. Even those who have attempted to scout his home from the air have come up empty-handed, leading some to believe that the creature disguises his home with [[Illusion|illusion magic]]. Zedoran generally keeps to himself, and emerges every few decades to raid settlements in Lastwall, Nirmathas, and [[Ustalav]]. When he does so, he is always followed by numerous tribes of orcs, who take advantage of the distraction to attack smaller villages. This indicates that Zedoran might have an alliance with the orcs, or else the latter are simply observant opportunists.
