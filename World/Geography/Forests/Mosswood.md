> The **Mosswood** primarily consists of large redwoods, leaving more open space at ground level compared to the [[Nettlewood]]. It lies south of the Nettlewood (and the [[Lost Coast Road]]), just east of the [[Tors Sandpoint hinterlands|Tors]]. Its main residents are the Mosswood Goblins: a very large tribe of [[Goblin|goblins]], led by the tenacious Big Gugmut, who claims descent from a [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]] and a wild [[Boar|boar]].
