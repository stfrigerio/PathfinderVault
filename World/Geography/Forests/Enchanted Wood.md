> The **Enchanted Wood** is a region of the [[Dreamlands]] dominated by colossal oak trees well over one hundred feet in height, with branches and leaves large enough to support the weight of [[Humanoid|humanoids]].


## Inhabitants

> The Enchanted Wood is home to tribes of [[Zoog|zoogs]], who live in the great trees' canopy. The forest is also home to a number of feline creatures, including [[Pard|pards]], which lair on the forest floor, and a unique breed of green-and-black, unusually social, arboreal [[Tiger|tigers]] that hunt high in the trees' branches. The zoogs, who greatly enjoy the taste of feline meat, are known to hunt the pards, but find the tigers too powerful and dangerous to approach. [[Evil]] [[Arboreal|arboreals]] are also known to live within the wood.
