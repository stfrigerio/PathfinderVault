> **Shank's Wood** is a small forest a couple of miles east of the town of [[Sandpoint]] along the [[Lost Coast]] of [[Varisia]]. The woods were unnamed until [[Vyron Jethezme|Vyron Shank Jethezme]] took up residence a few years ago. Shank was fleeing Sandpoint after killing an acquaintance in a fight. After several years of frequently ambushing both travelers and [[Goblin|goblins]], he is still seen occasionally by those out hunting. 



## Composition

> Pine and eucalyptus make up most of the trees in the wood, with blackberry bushes, cottonwood, manzanita, and pygmy oak creating the underbrush.


## Inhabitants

> In addition to Shank, the [[Seven Tooth]] goblin tribe lives in these woods, as do a few [[Bugbear|bugbears]], firepelt cougars, and wild [[Boar|boars]] (although fewer than the nearby [[Tickwood]]). The bugbears attack the goblins as much as they do travelers, traveling far out of the wood to make their attacks on humans. Even the goblins living in the wood have adopted this tactic, usually limiting their raids to the leftovers at Sandpoint's [[Junk Beach]].
> The goblins have been harassed by [[Harpy|harpies]] from the small, rocky islands to the north known as the [[Three Cormorants]], as well as the bugbears that live in the woods.  They have in turn created a game called "Grig Fiddlin'" which has driven off many of the region's [[Grig|grig]] population.


## Notable locations

> The Shankshack is where the wood's namesake built his home base after fleeing Sandpoint
