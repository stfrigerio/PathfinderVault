> The **Forest of Veils** is a vast and dense deciduous woodland in the south-east of [[Ustalav]] shared nearly equally between the two counties of [[Varno]] and [[Versex]] creating an autumnal display of note each year.


## Scope of the Forest

> The forest's southern edge acts as the border between Ustalav and the nation of [[Razmiran]]; its western edge is defined by [[Avalon Bay]]; to its north are [[Lantern Lake]] and the [[Lake Redleaf]]; to the east are [[Castle Corvischior]] and the three lakes: [[Lake Korsinoria]], [[Lake Eirio]] and [[Drakeye]]. Within the forest flow both the [[Nicklecross River]] and the [[Destach River]]. The south-western part of the forest, around the town of [[Illmarsh]], becomes marshy and is known as [[Soddentimbers]].


## Features of the Forest

> The trees of the forest are mainly cypress, laurel, and alder often of great height. Animals found in the forest include [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bats]], [[Wolf|wolves]], [[Bear|bears]] and [[Cougar|cougars]].
> Unconfirmed reports and eye-witnesses suggest a grave hydra called Yargouth the Ebon Fury resides in the Varno side of the Forest of Veils in a sinkhole to the west of the county.
> Within the forest may be found ancient stone circles and henges dating to the time of the [[Kellid|Kellids]] in Ustalav.
