***Main article: [[Scar Thicket]]***
> The wood has a dark, tangled heartâ€”a place where precious little sunlight filters through primeval growth. Known as the [[Scar Thicket]], this undergrowth-choked region is home to huge colonies of monstrous [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Level 1/Bat|bats]], vicious insects, and deformed [[Animal|animals]]. Youths in the area grow up learning to deal with [[Evil|evil]] [[Outsider|outsiders]], and the inhabitants are quite skilled at leading hunts for them. At the center of the thicket, huge mushrooms and other deformed fungi dominate the landscape, providing a home for a rare tribe of surface-adapted [[Vegepygmy|vegepygmies]]. Twisted tunnels lie beneath them, reaching down into [[Nar-Voth]] and connecting it to the [[Midnight Jungle]].


## Hellish reputation

> It is rumored that an unclosed portal to [[Hell]] can be found in the woods. [[Paladin|Paladins]] of [[Iomedae]] have vanished and several paralictors of the [[Order of the Gate]] have lost their entire commands while searching the area. The [[Order of the Pike]] runs active patrols along the western edge of the forest to hunt down any creatures that emerge from the woods. A reward has been posted to enlist the help of bounty hunters and adventurers by Master of Blades Tolsis Tuvadorn in [[Senara]]. It remains a mystery why the Hell-aligned [[House of Thrune]] would want such a gate closed.


## Observatory

> Striking a deal with [[House Thrune]] of Cheliax, the [[DragonAge categories|great wyrm]] [[Athervox]] maintains an observatory in the woods, near [[Senara]]. After years of instructing a small, pre-agreed group of apprentices, the [[Green dragon|green dragon]] was betrayed and robbed, losing many volumes of her notes. Still furious, the normally scholarly dragon now plots her vengeance.
