> The **Barrowood** is the largest woodland in western [[Cheliax]] and lies between [[Lake Sorrow]] and the [[Menador Mountains]]. The forest is a source of rare and valuable lumber, including barroak (used in ship construction) and shade maple (used in arcane implementations).



## History

> Barrowood is the location of [[Iomedae|Iomedaes]] [[Acts of Iomedae|third miraculous act]]. While mounted on a flying [[Griffon|griffon]], the soon-to-be-goddess cleaved Segruchen the Iron Gargoyle's wings from his body. The plummeting "King of Barrowood" created a large crater as he impacted with the ground, where she slew him.


## Inhabitants

> Despite the fact that the veneration of [[Asmodeus]] is the state religion, the people who live near the Barrowood tend to worship the god [[Erastil]] in greater proportions than those in the rest of Cheliax. No civilized folk live within the wood, although it does serve as a haven for those fleeing the law, including runaway slaves. Other residents include the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Goblin|goblin]] tribe known as Jurdan's Volunteers, an unusual group that has a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Human|human]] leader. A [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] mounted on a mighty griffon, called [[Ironwing Kazi]], aggressively patrols the forest, slaying [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Devil|devil]]-worshippers.
> The Barrowood is also home to [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fey|fey]], as well as [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Animal|animals]] tainted by [[Infernal|infernal]] influences.


## Place of Interest

> - [[Everpine]], a hidden enclave of feyâ€”chiefly [[Dryad|dryads]], [[Huldra|huldras]], [[Bestiary/Nymph|nymphs]] and [[Pixie|pixies]]â€”secluded from both Cheliax and the rest of the forest.
> - The [[Winter Grove]], a ruined druids' grove, is located in the southern portion of the forest.

## Rumours

> The Barrowood is the subject of a wide variety of myths and rumours:

> - It is believed a small [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Elf|elvish]] settlement and a [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] enclave exists within its depths.
> - It is said that Barrowood received its name from the many graves within, all said to belong to numerous petty tyrants.
> - According to rumour, [[Abrogail Thrune I]] made her infernal pact with [[Asmodeus]] within the [[Winter Grove]].
> - The [[Order of the Scourge]] is said to be constructing a hidden redoubt within the forest, and an underground highway that would connect it to their headquarters at [[Citadel Demain]], in order to use it as a refuge should Cheliax ever turn on the Hellknights.
