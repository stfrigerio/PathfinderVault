> The **Hanging Forest** stands at the western edge of the [[Land of Black Blood]], one of the vaults of [[Orv]]. It is a region of tree-sized fungi, and takes its name from the fact that mushrooms not only grow out of the vault floor â€“ they also hang down from the ceiling in a strange symmetry. Occasionally, these massive hanging mushrooms fall to the floor, potentially with unfortunate results for anyone passing underneath at the time. 


## Denizens

> The hanging mushrooms are home to bats, and also tribes of [[Cloaker|cloakers]]. The floor section is home to the fearsome [[Moldering Emperor]]. 


## Features

> - The Mouldering Emperor makes its lair in the largest of the forest's mushrooms, a 250 foot high specimen known as the Fetid Palace. 
> - The forest is the site of the Land of Black Blood's last remaining shrine to the bat-god [[Camazotz]], known as the Livid Sanctum.
