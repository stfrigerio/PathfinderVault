> The **Gronzi Forest**, also known as "The Forest" to the locals of [[Brevoy]], is the only woodland of any size within that nation. It covers [[House Medvyed]]'s lands and sweeps from the [[Icerime Peaks]] to the shores of [[Lake Reykal]], the former border between the nations of [[Issia]] and [[Rostland]]. Illegal hunting and woodcutting goes on around the forest's outskirtsâ€”particularly in its westâ€”even though its resources are ostensibly protected by the Brevic Crown. The parts of the forest near the capital of [[New Stetven]] have largely been clear-cut to rebuild and expand the city. Its woodcutters must travel ever further to the north and west to find unspoiled stands of lumber.


## Inhabitants

> The forest is currently menaced by a bandit chieftain known as [[Duma the Sly]], who raids merchants, travelers, and tax-collectors. The chieftain gives part of his proceeds to the poor, so the people love him, even as [[Noleski Surtova|King Surtova]] and the army oppose his efforts.
> The forest is also home to communities of gnomes. These enclaves are considered uncivilized and shamanistic by the usual standards of their race and mostly keep to themselves. [[Taiga giant|Taiga giants]] are also found in the Gronzi, having settled there after the opening of the [[Worldwound]] cut them off from populations farther west.
