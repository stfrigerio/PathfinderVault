> **Woodsedge Gaol** is the prison serving the [[Galt|Galtan]] [[Woodsedge|town]] and is situated close to the town square; it is fortified and used to hold political as well as criminal prisoners. The prison block contains many cells and interrogation rooms in its dungeons and on higher floors; these are often the final abode of those destined for the [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Artifacts/Minor Artifacts/Final blade|guillotine]] in the town square. 
> Prison guards are housed in a three-storied barracks on site. The prison block, the stables and the barracks all surround a common courtyard within the fortified gaol walls. A thick oak door in the gate house prevents escape. [[Gray Gardeners]], as well as the prison guards, are known to use the jail to interrogate people.
