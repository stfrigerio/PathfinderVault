> The **White Wood of Malarkhan** is a sprawling, hilly forest of aspen, pine and whitebark holly located in the [[Crown of the World]], north of the western [[Wall of Heaven]]. It is alive with the battle cries and songs of the bestial [[Troll|trolls]] and [[Giant|giants]] that live there as well as the howls and shrieks of the beasts that they hunt or hunt alongside them, causing some travellers to nickname it the **Roaring Forest** or the **Hill of Screaming Trees**.
