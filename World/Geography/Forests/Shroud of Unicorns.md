> The **Shroud of Unicorns** was a [[Sarkoris|Sarkorian]] forest in the [[Frostmire]] region that was the home to the largest herd of [[Unicorn|unicorns]] on [[Golarion]]. The [[WorldwoundFall of Sarkoris|cataclysm]] that opened the [[Worldwound]] turned this forest into a desolation of burnt trees and ash.


## Inhabitants

> The few remaining unicorns still living in the Shroud are led by twins [[Alunelsheas]] and [[Caedaynenlo]]. Since neither has been seen for many years, it is feared that they have perished or become corrupted. Some members of the herd still live deep within the forest where a few trees still grow. These survivors fight the [[Demon|demons]] as best they can, defending the woods from the [[Succubus|succubi]] and [[Incubus|incubi]] that are after their horns.
