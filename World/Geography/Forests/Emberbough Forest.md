> **Emberbough Forest** is a forest of cinderpine trees whose red and orange flesh and smoke-like pollen clouds give the forest its name. It lies east of the [[Sellen River]] between [[Hajoth Hakados]] and the ruins of [[Heibarr]]. While some forage and trap game within Emberbough Forest and treasure hunters seek lost ruins and [[Emberbough Cairn]], few live in or near it due to fears of [[Gyronna|Gyronnas]] followers.
