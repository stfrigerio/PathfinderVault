> The **Jungle of Worms** is a three-dimensional forest of corals and sea anemones found within the [[Plane of Water]]. The forest is structured in a complex layered system, the floors of each level being made up of the canopies of the one below it, and crossed by winding, aimless paths. The Jungle is inhabited by numerous predatory creatures, including [[Lusca|luscas]] and [[Sea cat|sea cats]]. In addition, the polyps of the Jungle are themselves carnivorous. Despite these dangers, the Jungle of Worms is home to a number of reclusive [[Merfolk|merfolk]] communities who use it as shelter from the dangers of the [[Plane|planes]] open oceans.
