> **Wilewood** is the largest forest in the [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Sevenarches]]. It is inhabited by numerous dangerous [[Fey|fey]], [[Arboreal|arboreals]], [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] and other forest denizens. The fey think of themselves as a sovereign nation within Sevenarches, and are unfriendly to all outsiders. They do not consider themselves strictly aligned with the [[Oakstewards]], but recognize the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] as friends of the Wilewood, working with them despite their chaotic nature. Many [[Animal|animals]] living in the wood are permanently awakened by fey [[Magic|magic]].
> Somewhere within the Wilewood is a great clearing hundreds of feet across. Seven Arches stand in the clearing, carved from gray-brown basalt and arranged according to some arcane pattern.
> The legendary [[Hydra|hydra]] [[Ladonica]] is thought to have been enchanted with powerful fey energies when it accidentally stumbled upon a gateway to the [[First World]] in the heart of Wilewood.
> The land around the Wilewood serves as a base for several tribes of [[Marsh giant|marsh giant]] raiders. They are brazen and sometimes raid as far as [[Riverton]].
