> The **Jungle of Hungry Trees** is often the southernmost forest in [[Garund]] shown on maps on the [[Inner Sea region]]. Located near the continent's west coast, it stretches from [[Desperation Bay]] in the west hundreds of miles to the east all the way to the [[M'neri Plains|Mneri Plains]]. Generally thought of as part of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] territory, the jungle is known as the [[Laughing Jungle]] north of the Lower Korir River, which is part of [[Sargava]].
Not much is known about the Jungle of Hungry Trees, not even where its name comes from. Its most well-known inhabitants are the magical [[Coral capuchin|coral capuchins]], sometimes trained as [[Familiar|familiars]] by spellcasters.
