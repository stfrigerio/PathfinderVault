> The looted **Woodsedge Lodge** stands in the city of [[Woodsedge]] in southern [[Galt]]. It was once an important locale for the [[Pathfinder Society]] and held [[Magic|magical]], historical, and cultural [[Artifact|artifacts]]; during its heyday, the lodge housed fabled treasures such as the [[Thorncrown of Iomedae]], [[Vesper's Rapier|Vespers Rapier]], and the [[Golden Carriage of Gaspar Longfellow]], among other items of cultural value.
> In addition, the lodge serves as an important hub for travel due to the [[Maze of the Open Road]].


## History

> The lodge suffered considerable damage when the [[Red Revolution]] first began, although it persisted in some capacity regardless. The death blow came due to a bandit raid in [[4704 AR]], when its remaining relics were looted. The lodge was then heavily damaged by the following riots when Revolutionary fanatics also attacked, slaying the [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] and hanging her servants from the three towers of the lodge.
> In response to the fall of their lodge, the Pathfinder Society secretly sent three [[Pathfinder]] venture-captains to Woodsedge to reclaim the lodge. This trio consisted of the elderly former adventurer [[Lofton]], the cunning [[Sorcerer|sorceress]] [[Senri Stenn]], and their [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/half-orc|half-orc]] leader [[Thuurv]]. The Society tasked them with uncovering information about the lost relics, reclaiming the lodge, and perhaps gaining revenge against those responsible for the lodge's demise.
> More recently, Venture-Captain [[Eliza Petulengro]] returned to [[Galt]] from [[Absalom]] in an official attempt to reclaim the building for the organisation. However, her presence is barely tolerated by the locals due to her less-than-revolutionary views and tendency to hire servants from the former aristocracy.
> After Petulengro's unmasking as a member of the [[Decemvirate]] in [[4719 AR]], the role of venture-captain was ceded to [[Armeline Jirneau]].


## Layout

> The Woodsedge Lodge is a two-story manor with a meeting room, great hall, kitchen, training facility, armory, libraries, master bedroom, and walled-in garden on the first floor, and bedrooms for guests, visiting dignitaries, and servants on the second floor. The grand hall contains the stuffed body of [[Beaky III]], the pet [[Owlbear|owlbear]] of [[Stavian I]], the grand prince of [[Taldor]] in the early part of the 46th century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]].
