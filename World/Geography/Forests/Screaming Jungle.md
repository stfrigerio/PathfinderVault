> The **Screaming Jungle** in the southeastern [[Mwangi Expanse]] is named after the constant screeching of the countless [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Monkey|monkeys]] who live in its canopy. The jungle floor is home to numerous mobile, carnivorous [[Plant|plants]]. The [[Korir River]] flows through the jungle. The jungle is a source of [[Darkwood|darkwood]], which is traded in [[Kibwe]] and elsewhere.


## Settlements

> The jungle's only settlement of note is the utopian city of [[Osibu]].


## Fauna

> Rising above the jungle is the termite-built tower of [[Dbede]]. The [[Mwangi]] consider the [[Sargavan boar]] to be an [[Animal|animal]] guardian who protects the [[Soul|souls]] of those who die in the Screaming Jungle.
