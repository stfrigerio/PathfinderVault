> The **Chuyokai Forest** occupies the lower reaches of the kingdom of [[Chu Ye]] and, due to its fearsome nature, it effectively serves as a buffer between Chu Ye and the neighbouring kingdom of [[Wanshou]]. The forest is generally avoided by most sane folk and even the [[Oni|oni]] rulers of Chu Ye, for in the heart of Chuyokai dwell monsters even the demonic oni fear. The Chuyokai Forest is also home to over a dozen secret [[Mizu Ki Hikari]] bases, the Mizu Ki Hikari are a group of [[Human|human]] rebels who resist the oni rule of Chu Ye. They use the Chuyokai due to it being an area the oni have no interest in, however, the Mizu Ki Hikari are active only around the forest edges as, like the oni, they fear the terrible things that dwell in the forest's heart.
