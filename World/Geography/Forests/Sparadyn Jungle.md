> The **Sparadyn Jungle** is a jungle located in the western area of central [[Katapesh]]. It is unique in that it is the largest jungle in the whole of Katapesh, which is mostly desert and savannah. Its most famous site is [[The Steps of the Agate King]], an agate-veined marble pyramid that supposedly is the final resting place of the Agate King and the vast fortune with which he was buried.
