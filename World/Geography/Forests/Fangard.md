> **Fangard** is the largest forest in [[Iobaria]] and dominates much of the nation's eastern reaches. Numerous factions call Fangard home, many of which remain unknown to outsiders. Protected by [[Lycanthrope|lycanthrope]] [[PathfinderWiki/Ranger|rangers]] and [[Hunter|hunters]], travellers are only permitted to cross Fangard on the ancient [[Koloran road|Koloran roads]], though a few lucky souls who tried entering by other means were allowed exit in the direction they came.
> Because of this secrecy, numerous rumours guess at what really lies within Fangard's depths. These include tales about a hidden [[Elf|elven court]], the realm of [[Erastil]] and other nature gods, and a still-surviving remnant of the [[Koloran Empire]]. The cairn of [[Hask-Ultharan]] rises above the forest's heart and is frequented by the [[Giant|giants]] who inhabit the forest. These giants have attacked [[Humanoid|humanoid]] settlements near Fangard, including [[Mavradia]].
