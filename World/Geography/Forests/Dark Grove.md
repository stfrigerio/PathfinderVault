> **Dark Grove** is a tainted region of the [[Fangwood]] in the [[Marideth River valley]]. The same blight had previously been spreading through the northern reaches of the Fangwood as well. The [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of [[Acorn's Rest|Acorns Rest]] are trying to find a cure, but [[Androssana]], one of the druids, believes it may be caused by the [[Abyss]].
