> The **Hoarwood Forest** is the only sizeable woodland within the ever-winter realm of [[Irrisen]]. Located in the southeast of the country (within the province also called [[Hoarwood province|Hoarwood]]), the Hoarwood is a tightly regulated forest where unlawful logging is punishable by death. The forest's coniferous trees are tall and perpetually covered in snow. Many rumours of danger exist about the forest, including glades that prematurely age those who wander through them, and a deserted village now haunted by black crows. [[Fey]] [[Wolverine|wolverines]] are known to hunt in the depths of the forest.
