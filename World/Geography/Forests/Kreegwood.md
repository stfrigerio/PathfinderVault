> The **Kreegwood** is a small [[Varisia|Varisian]] woodland tucked between the much larger [[Ashwood]] to its east and the [[Sanos Forest]] to its west. To its north lie the westernmost peaks of the [[Wyvern Mountains]], which includes [[Hook Mountain]], where the Kreeg family of [[Ogre|ogres]] once made their home. It is from these giants that the Kreegwood gets its name, although the forest was home only to their degenerate [[Ogrekin|ogrekin]] offspring (primarily the Graul family), until a band of adventurers wiped them out in [[4707 AR]]. Directly south of the Kreegwood lies [[Claybottom Lake]] and the small town of [[Turtleback Ferry]], while Lake Coal and the [[Shimmerglens]] can be found directly west and southwest of it respectively.
