> The [[Dryad|dryad]] named [[Akoni]] makes this grove his court over the other [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fey|fey]] of [[Tickwood]]. This court is held in the wood's deepest grove, where its oldest redwood trees stand. His court mainly consists of [[Grig|grigs]] and [[Sprite|sprites]]. The [[Redcap|redcap]] troop lead by Grustmier has poisoned Akoni's redwood with barkbleak in an attempt to take over the wood. This caused the dryad to enter into the tree in an attempt to save it. He has not been seen since this time, and the redcaps have taken over in his absence.
