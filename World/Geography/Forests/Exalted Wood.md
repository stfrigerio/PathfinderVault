> The **Exalted Wood** is a vast, untamed forest located in central [[Razmiran]], north of the much smaller [[Vergan Forest]].


## History

> In the days before [[Razmir]] ascended to power, the Exalted Wood was known as the **Vergan Forest**. It was during this time in [[2021 AR]], that the famous [[Taldan]] gladiator [[Maldar Tymon]] was given jurisdiction over a large section of the region that included the Vergan Forest.


## Inhabitants

> The Exalted Wood is known for a wide variety of dangerous beasts and animals including the [[Boar|blood boar]] and the large [[Owl|emerald owls]]. An unusual variant of [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaur]] possessing human arms and torso but with the head of a horse lives in the northern part of the forest, and speak their own language that is nearly unintelligible. [[Razmir]]'s faithful have tried to tame the forest and subjugate the strange centaurs, but thus far have not succeeded.
> Far more dangerous than any forest creatures are the clergy of Razmir who dwell in a hidden fortress known as the [[First Step]] in the central part of the wood, east of the capital of [[Thronestep]]. New acolytes of the faith are sent there to complete their training and come out forever changed, fanatically loyal to the faith regardless of any previous misgivings.
> Despite this, the Exalted Wood remains a hotbed for outlaws and rebels dreaming of a life without the [[Razmir|masked gods]] harsh rule.
