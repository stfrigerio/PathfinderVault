> The **Churlwood** is a dense forest of impenetrable thickets located to the north of [[Varisia|Varisias]] [[Lost Coast]], bordered by the [[Fogscar Mountains]] to the west and the [[Lampblack River]] to the east. Due to the difficulty non-natives have in finding their way through it, and its proximity to the settlements of [[Wolf's Ear|Wolfs Ear]], [[Roderic's Cove|Roderics Cove]], and [[Ravenmoor]], it has also become a favorite hide-out for all manner of criminals. Besides the bandits, it is home to small communities of [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] who guard the natural beauty of the place, a legendary [[Sasquatch|sasquatch]] named Paakis-si, and plentiful large vermin and wild game.  The [[Shoanti]] [[Shriikirri-Quah]] tribe consider the eastern edges of the forest to be part of their domain, and tribesmen sometimes study and commune with the native wildlife there.
