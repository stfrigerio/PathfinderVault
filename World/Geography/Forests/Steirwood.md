**Steirwood** is a small rotting forest on the [[Raugsmauda's Reach|Raugsmaudas Reach]] island in the [[Shackles]]. The forest was once home to many [[Animal|animals]] but now hosts the majority of the hordes of [[Undead|undead]] that aimlessly roam the island. [[Raugsmauda]] creates her [[Necromancy|necromantic]] horrors using victims she captures on her monthly hunts. Some of the terrible creatures that wander Steirwood resemble animals that perhaps once populated the isle or distant lands, including [[Cattle|bovine]] [[Ghast|ghasts]], [[Elephant|elephantine]] [[Skeleton|skeletons]], and [[Serpent|serpentine]] [[Ghoul|ghouls]]. The winding tainted trees spontaneously animate their barbed roots to gore and consume [[Zombie|zombie]] animals that wander too close.
