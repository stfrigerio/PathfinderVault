> The **Boarwood** is the largest forest in [[Galt]] stretching over 200 miles west to east, yet it never widens to more than 40 miles wide north to south. It lies east of the capital [[Isarn]] and north of the [[Kantele River]] and the [[Fog Peaks]]. The cities of [[Halvon]], [[Edme]] and [[Stavintower]] all lie on its borders. The Boarwood's easternmost trees mark the eastern border of Galt itself.
