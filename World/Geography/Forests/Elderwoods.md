> The **Elderwoods** is a forest located on the southern border of the small nation of [[Sevenarches]], in the [[River Kingdoms]], near the [[Kyonin]] border.
> The woodland is ancient and thick with [[Arboreal|arboreals]]. The rulers of Sevenarches, the [[Oakstewards]], meet and confer in a secret lodge somewhere in the Elderwoods. The lodge exists inside a series of enormous oak trees, joined by branches to create one huge internal room.
> Although the millennia-old lumber that could be produced here is of incredible value, the [[Oakstewards]] have forbidden logging in the forest.
