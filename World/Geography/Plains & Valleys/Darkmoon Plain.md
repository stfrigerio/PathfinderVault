> The **Darkmoon Plain** is a flat, lowland area found roughly between the [[Aspodell Mountains]] and [[Arthfell Forest]] of northwestern [[Andoran]]. Much of the plain shows signs of continuous logging over centuries, with fields of clear cut tree stumps covering the landscape. The area is also a geological hotspot, and geothermal vents are common.
