> The **Ashen Rise** is a small limestone escarpment located just south of the larger [[Devil's Platter|Devils Platter]] escarpment just inland of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of [[Sandpoint]]. [[Egan's Wood|Egans Wood]] can be found just southeast of it, while [[Cougar Creek]] has its headwaters here. Locals consider it generally safe (at least safer than the Devil's Platter), although flocks of [[Stirge|stirges]] have been encountered there from time to time, along with particularly aggressive ravens and crows.
