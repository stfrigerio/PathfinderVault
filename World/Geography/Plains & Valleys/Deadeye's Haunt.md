> **Deadeye's Haunt** is a narrow valley on the border between [[Molthune]] and [[Nirmathas]], at the southern edge of [[Fangwood]]. It is the site of the bloodiest battle in the war between the two nations.


## History

> Originally known as **Deadeye's Gulch**, the valley was home to a small shrine to [[Erastil]] where hunters could find succor. This changed when the Molthuni army selected the gulch as a staging ground for an invasion of Nirmathas, only to be set upon by several hosts of Nirmathi guerrilla fighters in the [[Battle at Deadeye's Gulch|Battle at Deadeyes Gulch]]. The battle lasted for a week before the Molthuni force fled back over the border, leaving many Nirmathiâ€”and many more of their ownâ€”dead in the devastated valley.
> All attempts by Nirmathi druids to resanctify the valley have failed due to the continued Molthuni presence in the area, and both nations now regard Deadeye's Haunt as cursed, a belief only bolstered by the ever-increasing presence of [[Undead|undead]] formed from the bodies and [[Soul|souls]] of fallen soldiers.
