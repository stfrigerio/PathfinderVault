> The grassy **Plains of Paresh** are located north of the city of [[Katheer]], capital of the satrapy of [[Qadira]]. The plains stretch from the [[Pashman River]] in the south up to the [[Jalrune River]] in the north, and from the [[Saray Coast]] in the west up to Ladan River in the east.


## Inhabitants

> The Plains are home to shepherds and tribes of horse-breeding nomads. The nomads love [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horses]] and a fine mount brought in by a visitor may easily be stolen. The nomads are happy to challenge outsiders to races in order to prove the rightful ownership of a fine steed. Their leader rides a white [[Genie|genie]]-booned stallion.
