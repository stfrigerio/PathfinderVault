> The **Horun Plain** is the central growing region of the anarchic nation of [[Galt]], located in the west of the nation between the [[Fog Peaks]] and the [[Southern Hymbrian Forest]]. Before the [[Red Revolution]], farmers here sent their grain to be milled in the city of [[Litran]], but much of this commerce, like everything else, has been disrupted by Galt's ongoing troubles.
