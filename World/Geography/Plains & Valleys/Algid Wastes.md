> The desolate badlands known as the **Algid Wastes** lie at the northern edge of the [[Hold of Belkzen]], where the land meets the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]]. The Wastes are even more desolate than the badlands to the south, being higher in elevation and covered nearly year-round by a blanket of snow. The [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Orc|orcs]] of Belkzen pass through this land in caravans on their way north to poach the megafauna that give the Realm of the Mammoth Lords its name. The orcs also fear the Wastes, as they are home to [[Remorhaz|remorhaz]], also known to the orcs as "ghost worms."
