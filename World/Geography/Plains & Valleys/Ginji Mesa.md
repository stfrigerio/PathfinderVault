> The **Ginji Mesa** is a large plain in the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] east of the southern [[Tusk Mountains]]. To its north rise the northern Tusk Mountains, while to its east are the dangerous [[Thunder Steppes]]. The Ginji Mesa is not without its own dangers, however, as the tribes and [[Following|followings]] here fear the mythical [[Nightsnake]], a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Level 1/Bat|bat-winged]] creature able to transfix its prey with a simple stare. The Nightsnake has been blamed for countless disappearances of livestock and lone individuals.
