> The location of the legendary **Green Valley** has been lost. It might be in a remote part of [[Golarion]], but it might equally be on [[Castrovel]] or a [[Demiplane|demiplane]] in the [[Ethereal Plane]].
> It was discovered many centuries ago by explorers from [[Azlant]], who may have been accompanied by [[Elf|Elves]] from [[Kyonin]].  They described it as an idyllic wilderness, heavily overgrown with trees.
> However, the Green Valley possessed some form of self-awareness, and perceived the visitors as a threat. While they slept, the primal intelligence of the Green Valley infected them with parasitic spores, which were intended to transform them into more compatible creatures. However, the visitors teleported back to their city base, and so the intelligence was not able to guide the spores' development. Left to themselves, the spores transformed the explorers into nightmare plant creatures â€“ the first [[Shambling mound|shambling mounds]]. Horrified by the experience, they fled into the wilderness, and all knowledge of the Green Valley's location was lost.
> Their shambling mound descendants are filled with a longing for communion with the intelligence of the Green Valley, which is forever denied to them.
