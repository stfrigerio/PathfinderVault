> **Tremor Valley** divides the [[Glazen Sheet|Glazen Sheets]] from the deep desert and the [[Parched Dunes]], in [[Osirion]]. The valley's walls are sheer, but deep ravines allow access from the desert above. Frequent earthquakes give the valley its name, though they are not strong enough to destroy the huge [[Gozarin Necropolis]] that is built in the valley. The cliff walls of the valley host numerous dwellings, with architecture that is obviously Osirian but influenced by a strange foreign style.
