*For another meaning of "Plains", please see The Plains.*
> The **Plains of Molthune** are the agricultural heartland of the nation of [[Molthune]].
> They consist of mile after mile of arable crops. Molthune's labour shortage is felt particularly strongly here, and [[Wizard|wizards]] in the employ of the government have attempted to solve the problem by animating the [[Scarecrow|scarecrows]] in the fields and instructing them to help plant and harvest the crops. The imperial wizards make monthly visits to ensure the [[Construct|constructs]] are working as intended.
