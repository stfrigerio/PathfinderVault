> **Mephit Spring** is a valley in the [[Footprints of Rovagug]] mountains of western [[Osirion]] that is the locus of several powerful [[Elemental|elemental]] forces. Located between the [[Kho-Rarne Pass]] and [[Tar Kuata]], the springs once were the home of many [[Mephit|mephits]] who communed peacefully with one another. Lately the mood has darkened, as a [[Demon|demon]] has taken over the area.
