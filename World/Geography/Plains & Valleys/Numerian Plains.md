> The **Numerian Plains** is the most fertile region in [[Numeria]]. It is separated from the [[Sovereign's Reach|Sovereigns Reach]] region by the First Blade's Path. The region's agriculture is so important that the [[Black Sovereign]] and the [[Technic League]] don't interfere. Of the four regions of Numeria, the Numerian Plains are the most "civilized" reaches of the land. Notable settlements in the region are the city of [[Hajoth Hakados]], the large towns of [[Iadenveigh]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Torch]], the small town of [[Marstol]], as well as the small community of [[Blackpipe]]. A number of small farming settlements are found on the shores of either the [[Dagger River]] or the [[Seven Tears River]]. The largest settlement of [[Android|androids]] in Numeria, the [[Szamrak's Haven|Szamraks Haven]], lies hidden in a series of caverns beneath the western Numerian Plains.


> [[Paizo]] published a major chapter considering the Numerian Plains in *[[Numeria Land of Fallen Stars]]*.
