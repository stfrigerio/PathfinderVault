> The **Egobarius Plain** is a wide expanse of rolling grasslands in southern [[Cheliax]]. It sits between [[Westcrown]] (to the south) and [[Barrowood]] (to the north). Roads between [[Egorian]] and Westcrown stretch across the plain, a preferred method of travel due to the dangers of traversing the [[Adivian River]].
> Although sparsely populated, the area is rife with bandits, making the area dangerous to traveling merchants. [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]] from the [[Order of the Nail]] occasionally sweep the grasslands to drive out these criminals.
> [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|Centaurs]] have long made their home in these lands, ignoring the rest of Cheliax in favour of their own traditions and inter-tribal politics. The largest tribe is known as the [[Swifthooves]], who sometimes provide aid to bandit victims and even interact with Chelish society.
> [[Maidrayne Vox]], Hellknight and [[Mistress of Blades]] to the Order of the Nail, grew up on the Egobarius Plain.
