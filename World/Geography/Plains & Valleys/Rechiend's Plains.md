> The **Rechiend's Plains** (variant spelling: **Rechand's Plains**) is the name given to the savannah that lies between the [[Mwangi Jungle]] and the [[Kaava Lands]]. The plains are some of the most fertile land in the [[Mwangi Expanse]], and the environs of [[Bloodcove]] are actively farmed. Tribes of nomadic hunters roam these lands, including the infamous Kuta lion-riders, who fight from the backs of [[Lion|lions]].
> In one otherwise featureless part of Rechiend's Plains, sits a treacherous fissure known as "[[Calistria]]'s Grin" which serves as the entrance to a vast underground complex known as the [[Gutblood Labyrinth]]. This buried remnant of the ancient [[Ghol-Gan|Ghol-Gani]] empire was once a part of the [[Cyclops|cyclops]] empire's holding in [[Nar-Voth]] known as the [[Reguare|Sleepless Realm]]. None knows what manner of creature still dwells in the Gutblood Labyrinth, only that the bodies of those who enter the labyrinth normally wash up on the shores of the [[Fever Sea]] weeks later mutilated almost beyond recognition.
