> The **Vale of Shadows** is a dangerous valley located in the [[Five Kings Mountains]], in which one of [[Zon-Kuthon]]'s [[Star Tower|Star Towers]] may be found. Here the planar fabric between the [[Shadow Plane]] and [[Golarion]] is weak and the Vale all but appears to be within the Shadow Plane itself; creatures and monsters from that plane may be found within. The [[Elf|elves]] of [[Elistia]] forbid entrance to the Vale of Shadows believing nothing good comes from it and having experienced that few return alive from inside.
