> The **Valley of Fire** lies in the southern part of the [[Icerime Peaks]] of [[Brevoy]]. The land there is blackened and melted and it has been that way ever since [[Choral the Conqueror]]'s [[Red dragon|red dragon]] allies scourged the land in [[4499 AR]], destroying the [[Aldori swordlord|Aldori swordlords]] last great army.
> [[Bestiary/Ghost|Ghosts]] of the soldiers who died in the valley still haunt it, preying on the living who dare travel to the accursed place. There are still treasures to be found in the Valley, however. In fact, artifacts like magical longswords have been discovered on the ancient battlefield.
