 Entering the Scar of the Spider.

> The **Scar of the Spider** is a small, fungi-encrusted vale in the southwestern [[Felldales]] of [[Numeria]], just north of the [[West Sellen River]]. Generally avoided by everyone, this valley of gray stone spears is said to be the home of a steel arachnid that strikes terror into even the stoutest warriors. Other legends tell of a glass coffin located somewhere in the vale, wherein writhes a dancing and whistling enigma.
