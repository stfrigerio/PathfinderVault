Unfortunately, in [[4465 AR]], the [[Rajput Shivji Shashibhushan|Vile Prince Rajput Shivji Shashibhushan]], a powerful [[Necromancy|necromancer]], violated this sacred site, harvesting the vast supply of bone and ivory to build [[Undead|undead]] known as [[Rajput ambari|rajput ambari]] and as raw materials for his blasphemous [[Palace of Ivory and Bone]].
