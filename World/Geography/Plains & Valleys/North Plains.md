> The **North Plains** are a low-lying tundra north of the [[Menador Mountains]] shared equally by the nations of [[Cheliax]] and [[Nidal]] and consist of rolling hills and grassy plains.
> Found roughly between the cities of [[Kintargo]] to the west and the [[Usk River|Usk]] and [[Southern Usk River|Southern Usk Rivers]] to the east, the North Plains are dotted with small towns and villages that face east, away from the cold, never-ending winds that blow off the [[Arcadian Ocean]]. The agriculture that is produced here mainly goes to supporting the population of Kintargo. It is also dotted with steaming brine springs due to local volcanic activity. The [[Salt|salt]] that is harvested from these springs is considered high quality due to its silver sheen and has become one of Kintargo's primary exports.
> The rains that water these prairies in the warmer months turn them icy in the winter, given them the appearance of a sub-arctic tundra. A fair number of [[Halfling|halflings]] live here, but keep themselves hidden for fear of running afoul of the authorities of either Cheliax or Nidal.
> The faith of [[Desna]] is strong in this region, and her followers work from here to oppose the shadowy influence of Nidal.
