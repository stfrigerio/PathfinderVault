> The **Rostland Plains** are part of the [[Rostland]] region, south of [[New Stetven]] and north of [[Restov]]. They are the breadbasket of [[Brevoy]]. The Plains are also to the east of the [[East Sellen River]] and south of the [[Gronzi Forest]].


## Peoples of the Rostland Plains

> Their culture is mixed between [[Issia|Issian]] and [[Taldan]] ancestry. People in the Plains, though close geographically to New Stetven, still harbor allegiance to the old [[Aldori swordlords]] and tend toward opposition against King [[Noleski Surtova]].
