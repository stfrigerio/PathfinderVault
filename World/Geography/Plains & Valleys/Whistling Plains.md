> Technically part of the [[Taldan Empire]], the **Whistling Plains** (sometimes the **Whistling Plain**) are a vast grassland beginning on the eastern border of [[Taldor]], that stretches from the borders of [[Galt]] in the north to the deserts of [[Qadira]] in the south, and then to the east, deep into the heart of the Padishah Empire of [[Kelesh]]. To its south, lie the [[Parchlands]], an area of desert inhospitable even compared to the other deserts of southern [[Casmaron]].


## Travel

> The plain is criss-crossed with dozens of old trade routes, used by nomadic tribes and merchants from far-flung regions, such as [[Vudra]] and the Keleshite empire. The land makes travel easy during the warmer seasons, but winter blizzards can make travel dangerous and difficult.


## Inhabitants

> The plains are also home to a myriad of creatures including [[Cockatrice|cockatrices]], [[Worg|worgs]], locusts, and [[Bulette|bulettes]]. [[Bison]] are also common in the Taldan portion of the Whistling Plain. [[Lion|Lions]] live on the plains, including a breed of [[Grisantian lion|grisantian lions]] sired by the legendary [[Grogrisant|grogrisant]]. A species of seed-eating weaverbirds, known as queleas, also live on the plains, congregating in large flocks. Overall, the land is wild and vast, although [[Taldan Horse]] stationed in the city of [[Yanmass]] patrol some of the land, ever watchful for highwaymen, or Keleshite aggression. A tribe of [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] resides in the vicinity of [[Sardis Township]], and occasionally trades with the settlement. Farther south, [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] sometimes travel to the villages in the [[Headwater Gap]].
