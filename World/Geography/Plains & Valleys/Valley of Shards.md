The **Valley of Shards** is a long shallow valley near the headwaters of the [[Asp River]] in [[Osirion]]. The valley's floor is full of shards of more than a thousand pots. The shards are inscribed with [[Ancient Osiriani]] [[Osirian hieroglyph|hieroglyphs]] which seem to deal with [[Magic|magic]], both divine and arcane. A small group of hermits study the shards, attempting to piece them together into a coherent message. The [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] roaming the region either haven't noticed the hermits or have left them unharmed on purpose.
