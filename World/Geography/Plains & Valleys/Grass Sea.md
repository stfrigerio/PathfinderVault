> **The Grass Sea** is a vast area of endless steppe that sits in the centre of [[Casmaron]], south of the [[Castrovin Sea]]. The Grass Sea is home to the nation of [[Karazh]], a nomad kingdom split between city dwellers and the free-roaming Kara horse tribes. The Grass Sea is arid and it can be several days ride between patches of water. Life on the Grass Sea revolves around [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horses]] and, for those who live there, horses are both their most valuable possession and most cherished companions. The Kara live a nomadic lifestyle, dwelling in felt gers that are easy to transport as they move across the Grass Sea moving their herds onwards to new grazing. [[Bison]] are a common sight across the Grass Sea as they roam in large herds.


## Trade

> At the heart of Karazh is the city of [[Ular Kel]], a trade hub that sits at the nexus of a series of trade routes between exotic [[Vudra]], the [[Kelesh|Padishah Empire of Kelesh]], xenophobic [[Kaladay]], and the nations that lie on the shores of the Castrovin Sea.
> Wooden statuettes of [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Eagle|eagles]], known as *caravan guardians*, are frequently carried by caravans traversing the Grass Sea to warn of the approach of danger. The *caravan guardian* can [[Summon|summon]] an eagle to help combat such threats.
