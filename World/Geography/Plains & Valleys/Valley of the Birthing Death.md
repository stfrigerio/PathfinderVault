> The **Valley of the Birthing Death** is located in the foothills of the [[Stormspear Mountains]] in the far north-east of [[Icemark]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. The valley looks as if it had been hewed clean out of the mountain and its narrow red walls create a realm of perpetual twilight. The [[Varki]] tribes avoid the valley due to the curse of [[Curses of Golarion#Birthing Death|Birthing Death]]: a curse manifesting as a rapid rejuvenation of the afflicted taking them back to childhood and then oblivion. This curse is not just physical but mental as well; stealing the memories and experience of the victim as they regress. Many have attempted to study or harness this strange effect but they have all succumbed to it, the knowledge required to understand the strange curse is inevitably one of the first things the curse claims.
