> The **Plains of Conflict** is a unique area that lies within the storied region of [[The Cradle|the Cradle]] in [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]]. The Cradle is not only full of history but the [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapadas]] of the region boast swathes of incredibly fertile and valuable farmland. Because of this, it is considered unconscionable to damage this land with war, so a vast area, the Plains of Conflicts, was left unsettled so warring armies from rival mahajanapadas could war with each other without disrupting the rest of the Cradle. The mahajanapadas of [[Kaurata]] and [[Pandata]] have been involved in intermittent hostilities for centuries now and shows no sign of abating.
