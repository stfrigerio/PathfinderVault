> The **Broken Shore** is a mile-wide sea of hard black glass and sand that ripples out in concentric circle patterns located in the [[Algid Wastes]], on the amorphous border between the northern [[Hold of Belkzen]] and the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]]. On its edge stand statues of forgotten gods, and it is avoided by both the [[Kellid]] tribes of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords and the [[Orc|orcs]] of Belkzen, who know it to be haunted.
