The continent of Casmaron, with [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]] to its west and the [[Embaral Ocean]] separating it from [[Tian Xia]] to its east. The [[Castrovin Sea]] dominates its center.
> 
**Casmaron** is the large continent to the east of both [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]]. It is dominated politically by the [[Kelesh|Empire of Kelesh]], a vast realm that extends even into Avistan: [[Qadira]] is its westernmost [[Satrap|satrapy]]. The second-most renowned nation of Casmaron is the impossible kingdom of [[Vudra]]. The adjective to describe something of Casmaron is Casmar; the people of the continent may be referred to generally as Casmars, although other ethnicities exist on the continent in addition to the specific Casmar ethnicity.






## History

> In the ancient times before the [[Age of Darkness]], the [[Cyclops|cyclops]] nation of [[Koloran]] ruled most of northern and central Casmaron according to the writings of ancient [[Iblydos]]. Some accounts suggest the cyclopes' realm extended into Avistan and Garund as well.


## Geography

> From the perspective of the [[Inner Sea region]], Casmaron begins west of [[Taldor|Taldors]] [[World's Edge Mountains|Worlds Edge Mountains]]. From there it stretches to the east and south-east for thousands of miles. Most overland travel and trade to Casmaron takes place along the [[Golden Path]], a route that begins in the Qadiran capital of [[Katheer]], stretches through the plains and deserts to the heartland of Kelesh, and finally ends in the Kingdoms of Vudra. Both Kelesh and Vudra claim huge territories, rivaling the territory claimed by [[Taldor]] during its height.
> East of [[Brevoy]] lies the crumbling kingdom of [[Iobaria]], a foreboding vastness of pine forests where small city-states fight a losing battle against encroaching barbarism.
> The heart of northern Casmaron is dominated by the [[Castrovin Sea]], a massive inland ocean along whose western banks lie the nations of [[Ninshabur]] and [[Kaskkari]], while Kelesh is located to the south.
> On Casmaron's southwestern coast lies the island nation of [[Iblydos]], while in the northeast one finds the mysterious nation of [[Kaladay]], a xenophobic land of fabulous cities and arid plains settled by [[Tian human ethnicity|Tian]] colonists long ago. South of Kaladay and serving as the site of great trade routes connecting most of Casmaron's nations stretch plains dominated by [[Karazh]], the land of [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Horse|horse]] nomads, and its *de facto* capital city of [[Ular Kel]].
