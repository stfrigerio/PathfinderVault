The continent of Avistan, with [[Casmaron]] to its east, [[Garund]] across the [[Inner Sea]] to its south, and the [[Crown of the World]] to its north.
> **Avistan** (pronounced AV-ihs-tan) is a continent on the world of [[Golarion]]. One of the most heavily-settled areas on the planet, Avistan possesses as many varied cultures and environments as any other continent in the world and an ancient history stretching back tens of thousands of years. The continent is home to once-great empires like [[Cheliax]] and [[Taldor]], rising powers like [[Andoran]] and [[Molthune]], and the ancient ruins of [[Thassilon]] in the wild frontier of [[Varisia]].
> Together with the northernmost third of [[Garund]], Avistan constitutes the [[Inner Sea region]].
> An inhabitant of Avistan is known as an **Avistani**.



## Geography

> Avistan is a peninsular continent which branches off the main mass of [[Casmaron]] west of the [[World's Edge Mountains|Worlds Edge Mountains]], west to the [[Arcadian Ocean]] and the [[Steaming Sea]].  The landmass stretches from the [[Inner Sea]] in the south, beyond which lies [[Garund]], to the [[Rimethirst Mountains]] in the north, which separate Avistan from the [[Crown of the World]].

## Inhabitants

> Avistan is home to a vast, diverse population of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Human|humans]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Elf|elves]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dwarf|dwarves]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Gnome|gnomes]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Halfling|halflings]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Orc|orcs]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Goblin|goblins]], and countless other races. Among humans, the [[Kellid human ethnicity|Kellid]], [[Shoanti human ethnicity|Shoanti]], [[Ulfen]], and [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisian]] ethnic groups originated in Avistan, while the [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelaxian]] and [[Taldan human ethnicity|Taldan]] peoples are descended from [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] settlers and refugees who came to the continent ages ago.
> In the north, superstition and barbarism holds sway, such as the [[Ulfen]] [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]] of [[Irrisen]] and the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], the [[Kellid human ethnicity|Kellids]] of the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], and the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Orc|orcs]] of the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. Further south, toward the [[Inner Sea]], the lands are more civilized and magic is more widely accepted, as in the centuries-old empires of [[Cheliax]] and [[Taldor]].
