> Perhaps the least populated of [[Golarion|Golarions]] continents, the Crown of the World is certainly not the least traveled.  Covered in glacial ice, the landmass sits atop the world and serves as a passage from [[Tian Xia]] to [[Avistan]], the most well-known of which is called the [[Path of Aganhei]]. Traders and explorers frequently brave the harsh cold to reach the other side of the world via this shortest route.

## Geography

> The Crown of the World is roughly divided into three geographical zones based on climate and distance from the North Pole. From south to north, they are the subarctic [[Outer Rim]], which borders the more southerly continents, the polar ice cap known as the [[High Ice]], and the cold desert surrounding the pole known as the [[Boreal Expanse]]. The continent's southern borders are the [[Rimethirst Mountains]], over which lie [[Avistan]], and the [[Wall of Heaven|Wall of Heaven Mountains]], which separate it from [[Tian Xia]]; cold seas separate the Crown from [[Casmaron]] and [[Arcadia]]. Despite its reputation as a frozen wasteland, the Crown hosts a vast expanse of rivers, mountains, wetlands, forests, and other biomes.

## Inhabitants

> Despite its inhospitable conditions, the Crown of the World contains numerous thriving cultures, most notably the [[Erutaki (human ethnicity)|Erutaki]] [[Human|humans]] and [[Ilverani]] [[Elf|elves]]. Most of the Crown's people live in isolated communities or tribal confederations; the only centralized nation on the continent is the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] kingdom of [[Zavaten Gura]].
> Monsters such as [[White dragon|white dragons]], [[Frost giant|frost giants]], [[Wendigo|wendigos]], and [[Remorhaz|remorhazes]] also inhabit the frigid continent. Furthermore, the ice holds the ruins of a highly advanced civilization, which predates even [[Azlant]], [[Thassilon]], or the coming of the [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]] to Golarion, presenting one of the most perplexing mysteries in the entire world.
> Legend tells of the White Legion, an army of frost [[Wight|wights]] gathered in the Crown of the World. Their purpose is unknown, but there are fears that they are in league with [[Baba Yaga]] and her witch daughters.
