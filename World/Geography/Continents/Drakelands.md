> **The Drakelands** is the name of a continent made up of a collection of warring states on the [[Planet|planet]] [[Triaxus]]. It would not have been so different from the [[Allied Territories]] save for their leadershipâ€”most of the Drakelands' citizens are serfs, and lesser residents of the land are [[Humanoid|humanoid]]. The leaders, however, are [[Dragon|dragons]] and their savage kin. Dozens of ancient dragons maintain city-states here and engineer whole countries made up of humanoid servitors, while their offspringâ€”dragonblooded humanoids and the strange [[Dragonkin|dragonkin]]â€”act as the generals and administrators to these ancient wyrms. This arrangement has been in place for generations beyond remembrance and the original reason or cause has been lost to Triaxian legend.



## Inhabitants

> The majority of the Drakelands's population is made up of dragonkin and [[Triaxian|Triaxians]], who share their homelands with bestial [[Drake|drakes]] and dozens of powerful dragon rulers.
> In addition to dragons, dragonkin, and Triaxians, the Drakelands are home to species such as tribal [[Adlet|adlets]] that make their homes near the Vahara Glacier and [[Kokogiak|kokogiaks]] in their far north.
> The demonym for peoples of the Drakelands is **Drakelanders**.


## Government

> Drakelander society is dominated by a strict caste system: the [[True dragon|true dragons]] rule their various holdings as absolute monarchs, unanswerable to anyone else and with full authority over everything save one another. The dragonkin come below them, serving the dragons as generals, officials, consorts, and in other positions of influence. The drakes come next, alongside dragonblooded Triaxians. The rest of the Triaxian population that cannot trace its ancestry to a true dragon comes at the very bottom of the social ladder, serving its superiors as soldiers, serfs, and [[Slaves|slaves]].
> Few holdings are led by [[Good|good]] dragons in the Drakelands. The majority are held by [[Chromatic dragon|chromatic dragons]] of all colors, while the [[Metallic dragon|metallic dragons]] that were native to this world have been hunted to near-extinction for their role in aiding the Triaxians during the War of Heroes. Only the bravest remain now in the company of their peers, while the land is ruled by the savage ferocity of their [[Evil|evil]] kin. The change in seasons affects the balance of power in the Drakelands: in the spring, the powerful [[Red dragon|red dragons]] hold prominence, whereas in the winter years, the barbaric [[White dragon|white dragons]] rise to heights of power unimaginable in Golarion's long history. The [[Blue dragon|blues]] and [[Green dragon|greens]] are more active in the summer seasons, and in autumn, the savage [[Black dragon|black dragons]] dig in and begin fortifying their isolated settlements for the long brutal winter ahead. Those areas ruled by metallic dragons are often sought out by Triaxian serfs fleeing from chromatic tyrants, but need to maintain harsh, military lifestyles to defend themselves against their more powerful, evil neighbors.
> In addition to the dragon-ruled territories, the Drakelands are home to a number of scattered clans collectively referred to as the [[Unbound Tribes]], which maintain their independence by leading nomadic existences in the spaces between the dragons' holdings and fiercely maintain their freedom, refusing to permanently join themselves to either the dragons or the Triaxian-ruled nations to the east.
