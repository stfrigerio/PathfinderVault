The continent of Garund, with [[Casmaron]] to its northeast and east across the [[Obari Ocean]] and [[Avistan]] to its north across the [[Inner Sea]].
> **Garund** (pronounced gah-ROOND) is a [[Golarion]] [[GolarionContinents|continent]] located south of [[Avistan]] across the [[Inner Sea]], and west of [[Casmaron]] separated by the [[Obari Ocean]].
> At one time, central Garund was the heart of civilisation in the hemisphere. It was a major territory of the [[Cyclopes|cyclopes]], who once ruled all of Golarion. Their Empire perished before (or possibly because of) the fall of the [[Starstone]], which created the [[Inner Sea]]. Later, the citadels of the [[Shory]] flew through the sky, until their kingdom also failed. Now, much of the continent is uncharted and uncivilised, but numerous ancient ruins await bold explorers. 
> Today, there are also some highly developed nations including [[Osirion]], [[Katapesh]], and [[Holomog]]. Despite the civilizations along the outer edges of the landmass, it remains a dangerous and wild place. Whether one is exploring the unmapped jungles of the [[Mwangi Expanse]], traversing the magic-blasted [[Mana Wastes]] between [[Nex]] and [[Geb's Rest]], or braving the permanent hurricane called the [[Eye of Abendego]] on the continent's western coast, there are many ways to die throughout Garund.
> Together with [[Avistan]], the northernmost third of Garund constitutes the [[Inner Sea region]].
> An inhabitant of Garund is known as a **Garundi**.

## Inhabitants

 A [[Garundi (human ethnicity)|Garundi]].
> As with most of Golarion, [[Human|humans]] are the primary inhabitants of Garund. As a broad generalisation, the native humans of the north and east tend to be [[Garundi human ethnicity|Garundi]] or [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]], whereas those of the west and interior are of [[Mwangi human ethnicity|Mwangi]] stock. There are, of course, exceptions - for example, the Mauxi people are considered to be Mwangi, but they live in [[Thuvia]] in the north. Some isolated ethnic groups call Garund home, including the [[Caldaru human ethnicity|Caldaru]] and [[Lergeni human ethnicity|Lergeni]]. The nation of [[Sargava]] is home to many [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelaxian]] settlers.
> [[Elf|Elves]] are prolific in Garund as well. The so-called wild elves were sundered from their northern kindred following [[Earthfall]], when their ancestors took refuge in the Mwangi Expanse rather than flee to [[Sovyrian]]; Mwangi elf tribes include the western [[Ekujae]], the northwestern [[Kallijae]], and the northern [[Alijae]]. The elves of the northern deserts have a culture distinct from the wild elves.

> The [[Dwarf|dwarves]] colonized Garund after emerging from the [[Darklands]] in Avistan. The nomadic desert dwarves inhabit the eastern deserts abutting the [[Shattered Range]] in eastern Garund. [[Osirion]] is home to two dwarven cultures - the [[Ouat]] monks who integrated into human society and the xenophobic [[Pahmet]] or sand dwarves in the empire's southern mountains.. In the continent's interior are the more traditional [[Mbe'ke|Mbeke]] dwarves of the [[Terwa Uplands]] and the primitive [[Taralu]] or jungle dwarves of the eastern Mwangi Expanse.
> Two [[Halfling|halfling]] cultures are indigenous to Garund. The more common Mwangi halflings live alongside the Zenj Mwangi humans much like halflings elsewhere, while the halflings of the [[Kaava Lands]] have a reputation as savage cannibals.
> [[Gnome|Gnomes]] live in scattered groups throughout the continent. The communities with the largest gnome populations are [[Finderplain]], [[Tiven's Reed|Tivens Reed]], and [[Yavipho]] in [[Katapesh]]; and [[Quantium]] in [[Nex]]. Many gnomes inhabited the lost lands of [[Yamasa]] and [[Lirgen]] and now exist as nomads in the Mwangi Expanse and the [[Sodden Lands]].
> Among the savage races, [[Orc|orcs]] are rare in Garund owing to the continent's lack of many connections to the Darklands, save for the superstitious jungle orcs. [[Goblin|Goblins]] are very common in the [[Shackles]] and [[Mediogalti]], with a minority in the Mwangi Expanse and the [[Mana Wastes]].

### The West

## Southern Garund

> Only the northernmost third of Garund is considered to be part of the [[Inner Sea region]]. There has been little exploration of southern Garund by inhabitants of the north, as it does not lie on any trade route to [[Vudra]] or [[Tian Xia]]. The exploration that does take place is usually sponsored by the [[Pathfinder Society]] or the [[Aspis Consortium]].
> The early volumes of the [[Pathfinder Chronicles]] mention several of the strange lands of the south. In particular, [[Pathfinder ChroniclesVolume 4|Volume 4]] describes [[Durvin Gest]]'s circumnavigation of the continent and his interaction with the matriarchy of [[Holomog]].
> The savage jungles of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] dominate the interior of southern Garund just as they do in the north. Civilised lands can be found in the coastal regions, but even then there are tales of hostile cities built among the trees, massive termite-like mounds, and great swamps from which emit terrifying noises and mysterious lights.
> The wealthy elites of southern Garund take advantage of their proximity to the [[Antarkos Ocean]], towing icebergs north to enjoy ice year-round.


### Inhabitants of southern Garund

> The most populous races of southern Garund include humans, elves, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aasimar|aasimars]], [[Catfolk|catfolk]], and [[Grippli|grippli]].
