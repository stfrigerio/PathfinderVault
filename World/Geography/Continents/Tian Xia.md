The continent of Tian Xia.
> **Tian Xia** (pronounced TEE-yawn-shaw) is the continent geographically farthest from [[Avistan]], and lies across the [[Embaral Ocean]] that borders the eastern shore of exotic [[Casmaron]]. Often referred to as the **Dragon Empires**, Tian Xia is most easily accessed by the residents of Avistan via the dangerous land route over [[Golarion|Golarions]] northernmost continent, the icy [[Crown of the World]]. As a result of its distance from the [[Inner Sea region]], not much is known of this mysterious continent. It has acted as a cradle of civilization for nearly 7,000 years, and in that time has boasted three continent-spanning empires, the most recent of which, [[Lung Wa]], ruled up until a century ago. Mainland Tian Xia today has many different sovereign nations, many of which have experienced a cultural renaissance since the fall of Lung Wa.



## Geography

> The mainland of Tian Xia is incredibly large, equaling (and some say surpassing) the size of any other continent on Golarion. The mountains of the [[Wall of Heaven]] (or Qiang Tian as they are known locally) run along the western border of the continent's northern half from [[Hongal]] in the north, all the way to [[Nagajor]] in the south. The mountains are incredibly tall with few dips, forcing all overland east-west trade through a limited number of passes, the greatest of which is near the cosmopolitan city of [[Goka]].
> To the east of the Wall of Heaven, the land quickly becomes flat and opens into the lands once controlled by Imperial Lung Wa, now the territories of the [[Successor States]].
> Many of the islands on Tian Xia's northeastern coast are part of the empire of [[Minkai]], a land slipping toward civil war thanks to the holding of the emperor by the Higashiyama clan.
> Tian Xia's southern half is much wilder, and dominated by the massive [[Valashmai Jungle]], along with two mountain ranges: the [[Chenlun Mountains]] and the [[Sudisan Peaks]]. Here lie the territories of the realm of Nagajor, land of the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|serpentine]] [[Nagaji|nagaji]]; the mysterious [[Xa Hoi]]; and the distant islands of [[Minata]].

## History

> The history of Tian Xia is incredibly long and detailed, dating back 7,000 years to when most [[Human|humans]] in the Inner Sea region were still living in barbarism. [[Wen|King Wen]] of [[Quain]], for instance, has a 98-foot-long scroll that supposedly shows his direct descent from the first [[Tian]] emperor, [[Mu Lung]], while [[Shigure Higashiyama|Emperor Shigure]] of Minkai claims he can trace his family tree back 296 generations to the [[God|goddess]] [[Shizuru]]. During this long period, hundreds of different nations and three empires have risen and fallen, each of which has taken it upon itself to rename the continent they call home.
> The last great empire to arise in Tian Xia was Lung Wa, which ruled the northern half of the continent from [[4142 AR]] on until the death of [[Aroden]] in [[4606 AR]]. The natural calamities that accompanied his death led to massive civil unrest that collapsed Lung Wa and led to the current political structure of over a dozen Successor States.

## Inhabitants

> Most of Tian Xia is dominated by [[Human|humans]] of the various branches of the [[Tian human ethnicity|Tian]] ethnicity: the [[Tian-Dan]] (found primarily in Xa Hoi), the [[Tian-La]] (native to [[Hongal]] and the northernmost parts of the continent), the [[Tian-Min]] of the Minkai archipelago, the elusive [[Tian-Sing]] of [[Minata]], and the [[Tian-Shu]], the most common of the five subgroups, which dominate the Successor States of Imperial Lung Wa.


### Religion

> The people of Tian Xia worship a wide variety of [[Deity|gods]], many of which are unique to the continent, while others are shared with those found in the Inner Sea region. [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]] missionaries first brought the worship of [[Irori]] to Tian Xia in [[2187 AR]]. It quickly spread and is now the official state religion of most of the continent's nations.


### Slavery in Tian Xia

> [[Slavery]] is not limited to the Inner Sea region and is also practised throughout the continent of Tian Xia. This is especially true in the monstrous nations of [[Chu Ye]], [[Kaoling]], [[Shenmen]], and [[Wanshou]], where humans and other native races are kept as chattel, but also in the lands of Minata, [[Nagajor]], and [[Shaguang]], as well as the underground [[Darklands of Tian Xia]]. Slavery is even found in the cosmopolitan city of Goka, although it is heavily regulated there.
