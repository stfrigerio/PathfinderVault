The continent of Arcadia. The shattered remnants of [[Azlant]] are to its east, and the [[Okaiyo Ocean]] separates it from [[Tian Xia]] to its west.
*See also: [[Arcadian human ethnicity]]*
> **Arcadia** is a continent of [[Golarion]] located 4,000 miles west of [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]] over the [[Arcadian Ocean]]. Because of the long and dangerous sea journey needed to reach it, few folk of the [[Inner Sea region]] have visited it, and fewer still have returned. People who live in Arcadia are known as **Arcadians**.



## Geography

> The sea journey from Avistan to Arcadia is a treacherous one, as it leads one either through the sea monster-infested waters around the sunken continent of [[Azlant]], or far to the north via a long chain of islands that connect Arcadia to far-northwestern Avistan. Those who have visited Arcadia describe it as a verdant, natural wonderland filled with stunning vistas and boundless resources; parts of it seem to be completely unclaimed by civilization. Even though most cartographers do not possess an accurate map of the continent, it is believed to be Golarion's largest landmass.
> Likewise, few from Arcadia show much interest in travelling to Avistan, though some [[Segada|Segadans]] believe isolated explorers might have long ago secretly settled parts of Avistan.


## History

> Little is known in the Inner Sea region about Arcadia, much less of its early history. It was inhabited by [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Human|humans]] since as early as the [[Age of Legend]], during which southern Arcadia was dominated by the militaristic, tyrannical [[Razatlan|Razatlani Empire]], which lost most of its conquered territory in the [[Age of Darkness]]. Around the same time, northeastern Arcadia was attacked by [[Azlant|Azlanti]] forces, and subsequently entered a long period of isolation just before the Age of Darkness began.
> The first recorded Avistanis to reach Arcadia were [[Ulfen]] explorers under the leadership of [[Ulvass|King Ulvass]] of [[Kalsgard]] in [[-473 AR]]. A powerful [[Scylla|scylla]] [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Rovagug]] named [[Urtleytlar]] is also believed to have terrorized Arcadia's eastern seaboard for a thousand years before being called east across the ocean by the chaos that followed the death of the god [[Aroden]] in [[4606 AR]]. Even a [[Spawn of Rovagug|spawn of Rovagug]]â€”the great, winged monstrosity named [[Volnagur]]â€”is said to have wreaked havoc in the western interior in ages past.
> Millennia after the first Ulfen arrivals, the next [[Avistan|Avistani]] settlers arrived in [[Arodus]] [[4679 AR]], as part of a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] colonization expedition that landed on the Grinding Coast near the [[Degasi]] city of [[Segada]]. The first Avistani born in Arcadia was [[Pimm Deori]], 13 days after the colonists' arrival; years later, Deori also became the first Avistani to gain Segadan citizenship. Soon after the arrival of the Chelish colonists and a separate band of [[Andoren]] colonists, the local nations enacted the Segada Protocol to strictly limit and regulate Avistani colonization and exploitation of Arcadia. (See *[[Avistani colonies]]*.)


## Inhabitants

> Despite Arcadia's pristine appearance, it is not as uninhabited as it first appeared to Avistani settlers. Soon after [[Ulvass]], the first [[Linnorm King]], completed his epic quest and landed on Arcadian soil, he encountered one group of native [[Arcadian human ethnicity|Arcadians]]. The Arcadians that Ulvass encountered were the [[Kansari]] people, fierce combatants who fought many battles against the Ulfen invaders using [[Bow|bows]] and [[Tomahawk|tomahawks]].
> More than a dozen nations encompass Arcadia, and Avistani settlers primarily interact with Degasi, a [[Mahwek]] nation in northeastern Arcadia.
> Despite eastern Arcadians' general distrust toward outsiders in the centuries after Azlanti assaults, the Mahwek people of Degasi generally leaves Valenhall alone, having decided it is too heavily defended to be worth their trouble. The other Avistani settlements to the south (see *[[Avistani colonies]]*) have been met by inhabitants of the Degasi city of Segada, however, to both protect the colonists and limit their influence. The powerful Segadan military quickly secured a border with the newcomers, and Segada's commercial influence drew its parent nation of Degasi and a coalition of three other Mahwek nations to enact the Segada Protocol, an agreement that spared the Avistani colonies in return for strict regulations on Avistani access to the Arcadian interior and Segada, a 15% limit on the amount of income they can ship off Arcadia, and regular inspections from the Segadan guard.
> The western coast of Arcadia, bounded by the great [[Okaiyo Ocean]], is relatively sparsely populated.

### People of Arcadia

***Main article: [[Arcadian human ethnicity]]***
> Hundreds of unique cultures cover the massive continent, though few are known to visitors from the Inner Sea region (and fewer still in their homelands).
> Known Arcadian nations include:

> - Degasi and three other Mahwek nations that form a trade coalition
> - [[Three Craters]], a city-state in the eastern [[Land of Northern Lakes]]
> - [[Xopatl]], a nation in central Arcadia
> - [[Razatlan]], a former major empire now reduced greatly in size north of Xopatl
> - [[Innazpa]] and Nalmeras, neighbors and trade partners of Xopatl and Razatlan
> - Briarbough, a small forested area in the Deadshot Lands mainly inhabited by [[Beastkin]]
> - Crownpeaks in the Mildanesi Mountains
> - The [[Halana Theocracy]] on Arcadia's west coast
> - The Illani Plains north of Briarbough
> - [[Tazuni]] south of the Halana Theocracy

### Avistani colonies

> The only Avistani settlements of any size on the continent are the colonies of three Avistani nations on the continent's eastern seaboard, which are permitted by Segada through the Segada Protocol.


#### Valenhall

***Main article: [[Valenhall]]***
> [[Valenhall]] is the oldest and largest Inner Sea colony in Arcadia. It is a place where the great lords of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] come to die after embarking on one final voyage, island hopping across the northern reaches of the Arcadian Ocean. Those who reach Valenhall believe they have ascended to their final reward on another plane.


#### Elesomare

***Main article: [[Elesomare]]***
> The [[Andoran]] settlement of [[Elesomare]] was founded as a timber and agricultural colony during that nation's [[AndoranHistory|pre-revolutionary]] days, and is but one of a number of small Andoran villages dotting Arcadia's eastern seaboard. Long under the thumb of the [[Lumber Consortium]], the colonists have recently been able to free themselves from that organization's iron-fisted control. Because of the great distance between Elesomare and the homeland, the [[Eagle Knights]] have done little to reverse this trend. Elesomare exists with the heavily regulated permission of four Arcadian nations, including Degasi, through the Segada Protocol.


#### Anchor's End

***Main article: [[Anchor's End|Anchors End]]***
> [[Anchor's End|Anchors End]] is a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] settlement known for its extensive [[Gold|gold-mining]] operations. It is of great interest to [[House Thrune]], as it is among that nation's most lucrative colonies. Chelish [[Ship|ships]] bound for Anchor's End generally depart their homeland from the western port of [[Kintargo]].
> A second Chelish colony, [[Canorus]], was struck by disaster in [[4714 AR]], and its survivors abandoned the colony for Anchor's End.
> Anchor's End (and Canorus, until its abandonment) exists under the protection, and with the heavily regulated permission, of four Arcadian nations, including Degasi, through the Segada Protocol.


#### Gogpodda

***Main article: [[Gogpodda]]***
> Even though it is not an Arcadian colony, the floating [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Gnome|gnome]] settlement of [[Gogpodda]] occasionally drifts far enough westward to trade with the inhabitants of the continent's eastern coast.


### Non-human races & other fauna

> The Arcadians are not the only intelligent [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Humanoid|humanoid]] race native to the continent. The [[Syrinx|syrinx]], a race of [[Owl|owl-like]] humanoids, lives here as well, as do the [[Skinwalker|skinwalkers]], the descendants of [[Lycanthropy|were-creatures]]. Perhaps the best-known non-human inhabitants of the continent are the giant, ape-like [[Sasquatch|sasquatches]], and the beneficent [[Couatl|couatls]].
> Other less benevolent creatures include the aquatic [[Ningyo|ningyos]], [[Fire giant|fire giants]] who make their home near places of volcanic activity, [[Adherer|adherers]] who dwell near shamanic mounds, [[Shadow giant|shadow giants]], as well as [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Halfling|halflings]] and [[Wyrwood|wyrwoods]]. Of all of these races, the humans, halflings, skinwalkers, and wyrwoods are the most populous.


## Arcadia in Avistani culture

> Because of the length of the journey from the Inner Sea region to Arcadia, not to mention the danger, the continent has become a byword for perilous journeys and distant adventures throughout the region. An example of this is the popular sea shanty *Haul Away for Arcadia*.
