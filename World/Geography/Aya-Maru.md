> **Aya-Maru** is the name of a deep underwater trench that almost splits the centre of the aquatic nation of [[Xidao]]. While Xidao is a nation of relatively pacifistic [[Locathah|locathahs]], [[Cecaelia|cecaelias]] and [[Triton|tritons]], the Aya-Maru is the reason why it has never known true peace. While most of the [[Xidao Gulf]] is only a few hundred feet deep, the Aya-Maru is over three miles deep with some claiming it has no bottom, instead linking to some deep underwater region of [[Hell]] itself. The walls of Aya-Maru are riddled with caves and cavern complexes that serve as the lairs for countless tribes and petty kingdoms of [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] and [[Merrow|merrows]]. Were these bickering groups ever to be united under a single leader the devastation that they could cause Xidao and the land-bound kingdoms surrounding it would be apocalyptic. But something even worse lurks below this, at the deepest points of the Aya-Maru dwell the [[Kraken|krakens]]. Mercifully these vast, powerful, malevolent beings almost never visit the surface and those that do are normally outcasts or exiles, banished from Aya-Maru's benighted depths.
