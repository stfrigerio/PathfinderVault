> **Blackraven Hall** is a fortress constructed for the sole purpose of monitoring the eastern border of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] from the monstrous creatures in neighbouring [[Irrisen]]. It is the largest fortress in the nation, and overlooks the [[Rimeflow River]] in the eastern [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Hagreach]].



## Description

> The massive granite fortification of Blackraven Hall sits on the border with Irrisen, its crenellations topped with the decapitated heads of [[Ice troll|ice trolls]] and other [[Evil|evil]] minions of the [[Elvanna|Witch Queen]].


## History

> Built in [[3314 AR]], Blackraven Hall was always intended as a bulwark against the forces of the [[Baba Yaga]]. It was built atop the foundations of a [[Thassilonian|Thassilon]] pyramid, an enormous granite structure filled with numerous underground chambers and strange [[Magic|magical]] resources. These ancient resources (including bound [[Golem|golems]] and controlled [[Outsider|outsiders]]) have proven invaluable in the defense of Blackraven Hall time and time again, especially against the vile [[Witch|witch]] magic that could have slain the [[Human|human]] defenders with ease.


## Inhabitants

> The organisation known as the [[Blackravens]] is responsible for the fortress' defense. Their leader, [[Freyr Darkwine]], has spent the last decade improving the already formidable defenses by orchestrating the excavation of a moat, and the building of spike-filled ditches and other obstacles designed to hinder attackers. Several [[River drake|river drakes]] have allied themselves with the Blackravens, inhabiting the moat and strengthening the defenses even further. Darkwine's second-in-command, [[Stenvast Trollkiller]] is a young [[httpenwikipediaorghuscarl|huscarl]] who would like nothing more than to launch in invasion of Irrisen and retake the lands lost more than a millennium ago during the [[Winter War]].


## Duties

> The Blackravens constantly patrol along Hagreach's eastern border, and carefully monitor the trade between the two nations, enforcing heavy tolls on any [[Ship|ships]] that use the Rimeflow River. The fortress accepts refugees from Irrisen but typically imprisons them for several days, weeks, or longer, before deciding whether the newcomer is a friend or a foe.
