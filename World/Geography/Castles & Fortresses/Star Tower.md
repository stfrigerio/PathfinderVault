> The **Star Towers** maintain the seals imprisoning [[Rovagug]], the Rough Beast, deep inside [[Golarion]].


## History

> The Rough Beast, [[Rovagug]], was so mad and [[Evil|evil]] in his designs for the destruction of creation that the other [[Deity|deities]] united against him in a unique alliance. The gods succeeded in imprisoning Rovagug and his minions within the centre of [[Golarion]] after [[Sarenrae]] cut open the world. Once the Rough Beast was locked inside the oubliette, other deities all made contributions towards the maintenance of the Rough Beast's prison. Of these contributions, the **Star Towers** are the most well-known.
> [[Zon-Kuthon]], then known as [[Dou-Bral]], contributed by closing up the earth over Rovagug's prison before driving an array of Star Towers like spikes into the [[Planet|planets]] surface to strengthen the seal.


## Known Star Towers

> Many Star Towers now lie forgotten, but some are known:

The [[Tower of Slant Shadows]]
This spiky tower leans across the grasslands of [[Nidal|Nidals]] [[North Plains|southwestern plains]]. Home to the sadistic fleshweaver [[Mother Ravel]], the tower is also the subject of an unusual conflict between [[Tarry demodand|tarry demodands]] and a fragile alliance of [[Desna|Desnans]] and cultists of Rovagug.
The [[Vale of Shadows]]
Located in the [[Five Kings Mountains]], the boundary here between Golarion and the [[Shadow Plane]] has weakened terribly. Until [[4711 AR]], it was the location of the [[Crown of Twilight]], part of a set of weapons for use against minions of the Rough Beast in case of an escape that were kept in a temple of [[Shelyn]], the sister of Zon-Kuthon, within the Star Tower.
The Star Tower of Castle [[Scarwall]]
Located in the [[Hold of Belkzen]], this Star Tower was chosen by the warlord [[Kazavon]] as the site to build his fortress due to its sacred connection to [[Zon-Kuthon]]. The Star Tower stands 110 feet tall, and its foundation is rooted hundreds of feet into the ground to a deep set of [[Volcano|volcanic]] tunnels. The tower is difficult to enter because it is warded with powerful [[Magic|magic]].
The Star Tower of Vekheen
This tower was conquered by the [[Dragon|dragon]] [[Raskineya]] in an attempt to release [[Rovagug]].
