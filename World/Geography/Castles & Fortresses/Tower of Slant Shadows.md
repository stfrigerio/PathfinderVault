 The fate of treasure seekers in the Tower of Slant Shadows.

> Located in the southwestern plains of [[Nidal]], the **Tower of Slant Shadows** is a rugged [[Iron|iron]] edifice that juts diagonally from the umber grassland. It is believed that it sinks several times its own height into the earth beneath it. A mystery to most, the tower is in fact one of the almost-forgotten [[Star Tower|Star Towers]], constructed untold millennia ago by [[Zon-Kuthon]] (then [[Dou-Bral]]) as part of the process necessary to confine [[Rovagug]] within [[Golarion]].
