> The frozen **Palace of the Brumal Lords** is where the three Brumal Lords are [[Magic|magically]] sealed, as they have been for the past 1,400 years. The three [[Fey|fey]], Baeloc, Nojec, and Yahlo, were once allied with [[Baba Yaga]], but after the Holvirgang Uprising, they retreated here and refused any attempts at peace. So Queen [[Jadwiga person|Jadwiga]] used the *Lock of Pajari* to seal them within its walls.
> Oddly, [[Gremlin|gremlins]] are the only creatures that can still get in and out of the palace, and will sometimes raid nearby villages.
