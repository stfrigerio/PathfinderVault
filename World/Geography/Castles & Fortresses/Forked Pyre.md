> The **Forked Pyre** is the mighty [[Iron|iron]] fortress at the heart of the [[Hanging Marches]], the [[Infernal duke|infernal duke]] [[Furcas]]'s realm within [[Avernus]]. The fortress is built upon a powerful cascade of roaring lava atop the swamp [[Volcano|volcano]] Barrowsiege overlooking the Pilgrim's Basin and it guards the main passageway to [[Dis]]. One of its three spiked black towers houses the burning armories of the duke; the second holds the barracks of the duke's 20 legions; and the third contains a dungeon packed with tormented rivals and useful [[Soul|souls]]. On an island upon the lava flow at the heart of the duke's palace, rests the six-eyed, [[Hellmouth|hellmouth]] called [[Gissiclis]], its bowels stretching to the Garden of Heresies in Dis.



## Points of Interest


### Altar of Barbatos

> A shrine dedicated to the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Barbatos]] that the [[Damned|damned]], either destined for the Forked Pyre or passing through to Dis, are allowed to use to beseech the Bearded Lord.


### The Last Grove

> An area overgrown with ancient trees and writhing vegetation. Within the dense foliage are the stolen monuments of fallen or forgotten [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druidic]] faiths, the last copies of several archaic druidic secrets, and the petrified remains of a lynx-like [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] once called Urhasdea, Sister of the Moon.


### The Red Warden

> A living gate forged from the [[Pit fiend|pit fiend]] Zhurook, who failed in its service to the Knight of Laurels. Reshaped by Furcas himself, the former pit fiend is now a gate of scales and forever molten iron. Zhurook now serves as a commander of Furcas's guard and as an immovable sentinel forever guarding passage deeper into the Forked Pyre.


### Typhon's Oppression

> A monument to [[Typhon]] made of obsidian and steel. It overlooks the Forked Pyre's lavafall and all those who enter the citadel. Within the construct is one of Typhon's [[Poisons of Golarion|poisoned]] claws, which bestows upon it some of the deceased archdevil's former power.


### The Walk of Laurels

> This inner wall controls the flow of the Torn Oath, as well as serving as an observation deck for Duke Furcas to oversee the endless stream of damned souls destined for Dis and the patrols of his uncannily disciplined troops.
