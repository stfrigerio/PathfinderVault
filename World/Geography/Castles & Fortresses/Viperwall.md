**Viperwall** is the name of the notorious keep built on the eastern shores of [[Ember Lake]] in central [[Varisia]]. Its many conical towers and serpent carvings emit a sickening green light and [[Poison|poisonous]] fumes, so it is to no surprise that the place is greatly avoided by the local population. Rumor has it that the castle was built sometime in the mid-fifth millennium [[AR]] by [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]] who traveled up from [[Sekamina]] through the [[Mobhad Leigh]] in order to create a surface outpost for their race. Others believe that the fortress has existed since the time of [[Thassilon]]. Deep within the keep is a portal to the ruins of [[Sverenagati]].
