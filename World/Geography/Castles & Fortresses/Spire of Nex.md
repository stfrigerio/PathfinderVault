> The **Spire of Nex** is an impossibly tall siege castle created by the archmage [[Nex (person)|Nex]] as part of his unsuccessful siege of [[Absalom]] in [[166 AR]]. Nex constructed it using a shard from his personal [[Demiplane|demiplane]] known as the [[Crux of Nex]].


## Location and layout

> The Spire is a mile-high column of smooth grey stone located 10 miles north of Absalom in the [[Cairnlands]]. It holds dozens of pocket dimensions, which Nex used to draw countless creatures from numerous different realities to aid in his war effort. The spire is so tall that it can be seen from nearly all of [[City districts of Absalom|Absaloms city districts]], and along with the [[Absalom Lighthouse]], the [[Blue Tower]], and the peaks of the [[Kortos Mounts]], the Spire of Nex is among the most recognizable parts of Absalom's skyline.


## Destination for adventure

> Today, the Spire continues to attract [[Adventurer|adventurers]] despite the lack of obvious entrances. There are plenty of tales of those who have managed to find a way in—and of the strange monsters that have managed to find a way out.
