> The **Spire of Destiny** is a tall formation of white rock that rises 300 feet above the surface of [[Lake Ocota]] in the [[Mwangi Jungle]]. Its unusually regular appearance is the subject of a number of legends. The local [[MwangiCulture|Zenj]] tribes believe it may have been built by [[Titan|titans]]. A more mythical tale claims that it is the spear of [[Gozreh]], which the deity thrust into the earth in order to bring forth the region's many rivers.
