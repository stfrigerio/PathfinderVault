> **Citadel Gheisteno** was the headquarters of the [[Order of the Crux]], a now defunct order of mercenaries who claimed to be [[Hellknights]]. The order refused to disband after the [[Chelish Civil War]] and was destroyed by the [[Order of the Scourge]] in [[Desnus]] [[4663 AR]]. The castle too was put to the torch, and it stood for over 50 years as a charred reminder to those who might oppose the [[Hell|Hell-inspired]] proponents of absolute [[Law|law]].
> In [[4688 AR]], a grim parody of the former fortress reappeared along with three [[Undead|undead]] [[Graveknight|graveknights]] who called themselves the Order of the Crux, and began to gather an army of deathless soldiers around them.


## Description

> Citadel Gheisteno can be found in the [[Menador Mountains]] along the [[Cheliax]]-[[Nidal]] border, near the source of the [[Southern Usk River]]. The newly raised castle bears a close resemblance to its destroyed namesake, with the most notable difference being countless charred black skulls that sit atop the mortar of the citadel's black walls.


## Inhabitants

> The countless undead of Gheisteno are led by the poison-shrouded [[Shokneir|Lictor Shokneir]] and his two graveknight lieutenants.
