 Symbol of the Order of the Gate.

> **Citadel Enferac** is the stronghold of the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Gate]]. Located in the [[Menador Mountains]], Citadel Enferac is the primary place where [[World/Culture/Titles & Kings/Hellknight signifer|Hellknight signifers]] (spellcasters) are trained.
> Constructed by inhuman hands, only a small part of the fortress rises upon the slopes of [[Mount Nyisaid]]. The larger part of the citadel lies within the mountain, spread through great caverns and halls. The smoke of numerous forges and [[Laboratories|laboratories]] rises from the fortress like eerie pennants; and spiked towers and precarious walkways mar the higher slopes. At the top of the mountain, the [[Iron|iron]] statue of a huge Hellknight guards a gate for flying visitors. The citadel includes garrisons, training halls, armories, libraries, workshops, and fortifications. Tales also tell of a prison for terrible creatures within the citadel which resembles a pit into a black eternity.
> Deep within Citadel Enferac is a [[Portal|portal]] that leads to the Razor Stair, a library in [[Stygia]], fifth level of [[Hell]]. The Order of the Gate's signifers frequently go there to consult with Mahshoka and Sister Drove, two [[Uniila|uniilas]] who curate the Razor Stair. Despite decades of control, the Order of the Gate has not explored far beyond the portal due to the difficulty of navigating the Razor Stair; nevertheless, its members' sojourns have brought back many fantastic secrets and powerful [[Weapon|weapons]]. Spies infiltrating Citadel Enferac have reported that this portal is no longer the only one within Mount Nyisaid, and nor is it the most terrifying.


## History

> The creation of the citadel was funded by the [[Wizard|wizard]] [[Sheel Leroung]] who was a political ally of [[Daidian Ruel]]. In [[4599 AR]], Lictor [[Aligois Thels]] granted the wizard 20 Hellknights to go into the western reaches of the Menador Mountains on a private venture. In return, the nobleman wizard funded the construction of a new Hellknight fortress there.
