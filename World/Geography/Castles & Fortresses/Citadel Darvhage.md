> The ruins of **Citadel Darvhage** lie on the northern coast of [[Lake Sorrow]] in central [[Cheliax]], and were once the home of the [[Hellknights|Hellknight]] [[Order of the Vice]]. The citadel (along with the entire order) was destroyed some time ago by unknown assailants. Travelers give the ruins a wide berth, but those that pass close to them report flashes of green light coming from the ruins during the night. Reports have also come of mutated animals, such as [[Bear|bears]] with [[Lion|lion]] heads and vestigial wings, roaming around the ruins of Citadel Darvhage.
