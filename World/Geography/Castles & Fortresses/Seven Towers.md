> The district of **Seven Towers** in [[Oppara]] is named for a group of six crumbling towers arranged in a circular pattern around a central column. Most of the residents in the district belong to the senatorial class.
> The district was built on top of the ruins of the original [[Azlant|Azlanti]] settlement that was once founded in the region. While most of the ruins are gone, many [[Dungeon|dungeon]] complexes and interconnected vaults can be found beneath the district. The entrances to the subterranean complexes are sealed by the government, though no official reason for this has been publicly announced. Rumours abound of [[Undead|undead]] walking through the streets at night and of the namesake towers humming low, discordant notes while the ground itself seems to undulate.
