> The **Castle District** is the district of [[Kintargo]] that lies to the north of [[Old Kintargo]] and [[Jarvis End]] on [[Argo Isle]]. Dominated by [[Castle Kintargo]] that was built atop an easily defensible high bluff, the rest of the district slopes down towards the surrounding city. The Castle District is home to not just Kintargo's military heart but also much of its civilian government, including [[Andos Hall]] and various business that support them, like [[Highwall Market]].
