> The [[Yolubilis River]] begins high on the slopes of [[Mount Spire]], just below the tree line, as a trickle that turns into a series of waterfalls. These waterfalls gather multiple streams as they surge downward, and the tallest, called the **Veil of the Spire**, falls more than 300 feet into a large pool that is the river's highest navigable point. Behind the waterfalls is an extensive networks of caves, some of which contain their own streams and falls. Many of these caves are riddled with cave fishers, chardas, and other monsters. In addition, several tribes of goblins and kobolds compete for a living in these caverns.
