> **Castle Galdcye** is a ruined keep in the mountainous [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Amaans]].  Located in the [[Vale of Red Breath]], it sits near the small village of [[Sen's Pass|Sens Pass]].  Formerly the home of the [[Galdyce|Viscount Galdyce]], a [[Nosferatu|nosferatu]] [[Vampire|vampire]] and also the ruler of Amaans, it was destroyed following the Viscount's apparent true death in [[4685 AR]].  Galdyce had terrorized the region for years in his fruitless search to sire a male heir, taking countless vampire brides in the process.  Lately, lights have been spotted in the ruin at night, leading locals to fear that the Viscount, or one of his vampire brides, has returned.
