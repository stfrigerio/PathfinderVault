> **Fort Nunder** is the [[Chernasardo Rangers]] stronghold closest to the [[Nesmian Plains]] of [[Nirmathas]]. It sits against the west side of a steep hill called Nunder Scarp. Decades ago, the Rangers constructed a vault beneath the hill to secure specialized [[Weapon|weapons]] and equipment. The two best trapsmiths among the Rangers, Dargrit Foehewer and Ekaterin Fletcher, built two separate, trapped passages leading to the vault. Fort Nunder is more of a storehouse than a fortress. A handful of barracks are available, but the bulk of the fort is dedicated to storage space.
