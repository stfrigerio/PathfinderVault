> **Raugsmauda's Tower** is located at the western edge of the [[Raugsmauda's Reach|Raugsmaudas Reach]] island in the [[Shackles]]. It is a stone tower six-stories high, looming over a natural harbor. The long wharf of the [[Raugsmauda]]'s dreaded [[Ship|galleon]] *[[Naiegoul]]* is just out from the tower's heavy iron portcullis.
