> The **Trilmsgitt Towers** in [[Molthune]] are three towers, each within several miles of the others. They were built by three brothers, each of whom was a [[Wizard|wizard]], and are believed to be connected to each other by [[Magic|magic]]. However, nothing has been heard from any of the brothers for some time, and the towers appear to have been abandoned for some unknown reason.
