> **Fort Kragang** is an occupied fort among the mountain realms of [[Zi Ha]], originally constructed by invading [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]] from [[Kaoling]] under the leadership of Warlord [[Tsung-cha Kavangaki]]. It is currently occupied by a contingent of troops led by [[Ping-la Maningki]], which harass local [[Samsaran|samsarans]], raiding them for supplies and capturing them. Some samsarans of Zi Ha have hired mercenaries to oppose the hobgoblins, so it may only be a matter of time before a clash erupts.
