> The [[Frost giant|frost giant]] town of **Holvirgang** is located in the far north of the [[Witch|witch]] realm of [[Irrisen]], hard against the icy tundra of the [[Crown of the World]]. Built into the side of a glacier, the town is composed of an outer walled bailey open to all, and the caverns of [[Holvir]] carved into the ice, where only the frost giants are allowed.



## Government

> The keep is ruled by the frost giant [[Grungginnir|Jarl Grungginnir]], a devotee of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Kostchtchie]], and his [[White dragon|white dragon]] companion. Even though he is an ally of [[Elvanna|Queen Elvanna]] who sends regular levies of frost giant warriors (known as [[Druzhinnik|druzhinniks]]) to serve in her army, he is said to resent being subservient to a female.


## Inhabitants

> Holvirgang is a meeting place for [[Kellid]] traders from the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], merchants who travel over the [[Crown of the World]], and [[Fey|fey]] from Irrisen. None but the frost giants are permitted to leave the outer bailey, however.


### Notable inhabitants

> - Yrsa Betyrina, Irrisen's ambassador in Holvirgang
> - Holg Tuskrider, a merchant from [[Icestair]] who frequently visits Holvirgang
