> More of a fortified mustering station than a traditional town, **Castle Firrine** stands just south of [[Ghostlight Marsh]] at the edge of a war zone in the nation of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]]. It serves as a supply station and a place to regroup for knights battling the [[Orc|orcs]] to the west and [[Undead|undead]] to the north. There it controls the headland formed by the confluence of the [[River Esk|Esk]] and [[Kestrel River|Kestrel Rivers]].


## Inhabitants

> [[Cleric|Clerics]] of [[Iomedae]] administer healing to injured soldiers transported from the front lines, artisans and [[Engineering|engineers]] build and repair equipment vital for the war effort, and Battlemasters of [[Gorum]] rouse the fighting spirit of the crusaders. Despite the Gorumite fervor, the appearance of [[Half-orc|half-orc]] [[Warpriest|warpriests]] of Gorum in the [[Hold of Belkzen|Hold of Belkzens]] armies is a source of considerable concern.
