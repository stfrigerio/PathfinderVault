> **Castle Overwatch** in [[Vigil]] is established upon a rocky hill at the bend of the [[Path River]], called the [[Watcher's Tor|Watchers Tor]]. Its 100-pace high central tower provides a clear view of the [[Hold of Belkzen]] frontier, the river, and even the [[Virlych]] hills. By night, the great tower and turrets of the keep below are lit with a [[Magic|magically]] created golden flame, which sheds light all around the city of Vigil and gives an advantage to its defenders against the [[Orc|orcs]] and many [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] terrors moving in the dark.
> The original watchtower of [[Fort Lorrin]] which was located upon the Watcher's Tor, still stands as a monument, enshrined within the ground floor of the great tower of the castle, together with the holiest relic of the [[Shining Crusade]], the *[[Shattered Shield of Arnisant]]*.
> The central citadel of Castle Overwatch is home to the [[Watcher-Lord]], ruler of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], and the buildings of the [[Crusader War College]] are built in its outer bailey.
> An impressive feature of the Castle Overwatch is its magnificent [[Extradimensional|extradimensional]] stable where hundreds of [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horses]] are kept and tended. These horses are Vigil's strategic reserve of mounts. The stable can be connected to either the southeast gate or the northwest gate of the city, responding to an emergency.
