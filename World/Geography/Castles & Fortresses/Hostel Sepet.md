> The **Hostel Sepet** is a keep at the top of [[Sepet Pass]] on the trade route between [[El-Fatar]] and [[Ipeq]] in [[Osirion]]. It is built on top of an ancient Osirian fortifications on the eastern edge of the saddle of the mountain. It is surrounded by thick stone walls that rise up several stories. The ruined keep has been sealed up tightly, with only one heavily fortified gate and the narrowest of windows. The inside of the keep is a paradise of fountains and flowers. Hostel Sepet is the absolutely safe harbor for the caravans perilously journeying across the [[Brazen Peaks]] with [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]] raiders and dangerous wildlife plaguing the journey the entire way.
