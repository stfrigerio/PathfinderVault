> The **Saffron House** is a crumbling mansion once owned by [[Cleid Thord]] located within the murky [[Sclerain Swamp]] in eastern [[Canterwall]], one of the counties of [[Ustalav]]. There is something very wrong about this haunted and abandoned home: it is claustrophobic inside, the sheet-covered furniture is mouldy and there are noises from within the walls. Many of its room seem stunted or underformed, while others seem cripplingly small. Even stranger is a repulsive yellowing on every surface. Not many know of this house and fewer understand its blighted nature.
