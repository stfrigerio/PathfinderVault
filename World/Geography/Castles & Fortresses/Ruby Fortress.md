> The **Ruby Fortress** in [[New Stetven]] is the seat of power for the nation of [[Brevoy]], and serves as home of the ruling monarch. The symbolic throne of Brevic rule, the [[Dragonscale Throne]], is located here.
> Brevoy's founding clan, [[House Rogarvia]], held the Ruby Fortress for two centuries from the ascendancy of [[Urzen Rogarvia|King Urzen Rogarvia]] to the mysterious event known as the [[Vanishing]] in [[4699 AR]], in which the Rogarvia king and his entire clan disappeared without a trace. The fortress is currently home to [[Noleski Surtova|King Noleski Surtova]], the new claimant to the Dragonscale Throne.
> Unlike most structures in the Brevic province of [[Rostland]], which is poor in minerals and relies on wood for building materials for even noble manors, the Ruby Fortress is constructed of high-grade stone.
