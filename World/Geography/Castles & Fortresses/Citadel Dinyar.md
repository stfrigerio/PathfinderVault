 The symbol of the Order of the Godclaw Hellknights

> **Citadel Dinyar** was the base of operations for the [[Order of the Godclaw]] [[Hellknights]] under [[HellknightOrganization|Lictor]] [[Resarc Ountor]]. The citadel was seized by the [[Iomedae|Iomedaean]] [[Glorious Reclamation]] in [[4715 AR]].


## Description

> Citadel Dinyar features spidery buttresses and steeples reminiscent of cathedrals throughout the region. Visitors are confronted by grim statues of the Order's patron [[Deities|deities]] and this theme is repeated in the mountain stone and fortress's statuary. The path to the citadel proper is long, winded and easily defended.
> Past this lies the **Ardant Fist**, the chapel-keep. The five mighty bells, known as the **Empyrean Edicts**, ring loudly from here. The rest of the complex is comprised of cramped cells and cloistered walks, though rumours persist of hidden [[Holy|holy]] spots and shrines within the fortress and hidden in the adjacent mountains.

## History

> Construction of the Citadel began in [[4665 AR]] when the Order relocated to [[Cheliax]]. The construction was organised by Miron Vagaul, Hellknight and [[Dwarven|dwarven]] [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Torag]].. From their location in the [[Aspodell Mountains]] east of the [[Chitterwood]] within [[Isger]], the Hellknight order was able to quickly ride to other locations within Isger, or beyond to Cheliax, or even [[Andoran]] at the call of the temple-fortress' great bells.
