> **Bastion Tyrannous**, also known as **Armiger's Hold**, is one of the three distinct castles that collectively make up the headquarters of the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Nail]], [[Citadel Vraid]], in southern [[Varisia]].
> Two war towers, the [[Tower of Blades]] and the [[Tower Victus]] peer over the cliffs of the castle's east wall. The Tower of Blades is a heavily guarded tower in the northeastern corner of the bastion, serving as the headquarters of military operations and the residence of [[Maidrayne Vox|Mistress of Blades Maidrayne Vox]]. The Tower Victus in the southeastern corner of the bastion holds Citadel Vraid's armory, forge, foundry, and treasury. Barracks surround two small courtyards.
> The [[Keep of the Nail]] is a two-floor keep in the west wall where its first floor is divided into a dining hall and a common area, while the second floor functions as both a storage area and a commissary. Two watchtowers flank the bastion's barbican at the east end of the bridge, First Chasm, that connects Bastion Tyrannous with [[Bastion Dominus]], and two watchtowers are located in the north wall.
> The entrance to the bastion's under-cellar is located in the garrison block in the north wall. The under-cellar is a warren of alcoves used by the Indentured—former [[Slaves|slaves]] who agreed to buy their freedom from the Order by working as the citadel's servants.
> The [[Bridge of Eagles]] spans the wide chasm between Bastion Tyrannous and neighboring [[Bastion Ferox]] to the east. The bridge was named for Paralictor Kaan's vicious execution of [[Tungar Oxslayer]], jothka of the now-extinct Lamokra tribe of the [[Shoanti]] [[Sklar-Quah]] and leader of the Ten-Tribe's Rebellion.
