> The **Old Bridge Tower** is a squat fortification built on a hill overlooking the [[Andoren]] town of [[Riverford]]. As the nearby [[Old Bridge Riverford|Old Bridge]] is the only place in the area where an entire army can cross the [[Andoshen River]], the river crossing is of vital strategic importance to the nation of Andoran. It therefore has stationed an [[Eagle Knights|Eagle Knight]] officer along with a small contingent of soldiers at the Old Bridge Tower to train the local militia in the defense of the river crossing.
