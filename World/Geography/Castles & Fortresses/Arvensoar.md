> **Arvensoar** is the tower built by local [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisians]] and the citizens of [[Magnimar]] to replace the [[Seacleft Spire]] after it was destroyed by an [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Angel|angelic]] being. It took over 18 years to create the tower, but it now stands as a symbol of the city's receptiveness to the guidance of [[Good|good]] spirits.
> The tower is approximately 400 feet in height, towering over the districts of [[Lowcleft]] and [[Naos]], and is the tallest structure in Magnimar. The tower serves as the barracks and fortress for the [[Magnimar city watch|local city watch]] and is defended with eight powerful trebuchets able to target any attackers regardless of the direction from which they attack.
