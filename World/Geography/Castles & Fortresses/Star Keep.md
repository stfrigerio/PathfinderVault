> **Star Keep** is a fortress on the [[Mendev|Mendevian]] banks of the [[West Sellen River]] overlooking the southeastern plains of the [[Demon|demon-infested]] [[Worldwound]]. It is staffed by a number of holy [[Paladin|paladin]] orders who work independently from the national command in [[Nerosyan]]. Rumors along the [[Crusader Road]] claim that the soldiers of the keep strike deep into the Worldwound to track demonic troop movements, or make precise incursions to take down particularly troublesome opponents.
