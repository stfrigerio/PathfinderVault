> **Bleakwall** is the insufficient defensive barricade built between [[Canterwall|County Canterwall]] in [[Ustalav]] and the [[Orc|orc]] [[Hold of Belkzen]] to the west. It runs for approximately 90 miles from the [[Tusk Mountains]] in the north to the borders with [[Virlych]] in the south, but is often broken in stretches of up to a quarter-mile. The wall can hardly even be called that, reaching only two to four feet in height in most places, with few defensive towers still standing. The only two truly defensible positions along the Bleakwall are [[Tower Valballus]] and [[Castle Andachi]], but the militia of Canterwall refuse to go near them, as rumors abound that they are guarded by creatures feared even by the orcs.
