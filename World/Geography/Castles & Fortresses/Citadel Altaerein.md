*This article covers the former [[Hellknights]] citadel. For the [[Age of Ashes adventure path|Age of Ashes Adventure Path]] issue, see [[Hellknight Hill adventure]].*
> **Citadel Altaerein** is the abandoned former headquarters of the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Nail]], located in eastern [[Isger]], high in the northwestern [[Five Kings Mountains]], close to the border with [[Druma]]. It overlooks the town of [[Breachill]], whose residents call it **Hellknight Hill** and largely ignore it. Citadel Altaerein was built directly above [[Alseta's Ring|Alsetas Ring]], an ancient ring of [[Elf|elven]] [[Portal|portals]].


## History

> In [[4638 AR]], the Order of the Nail, impressed with the peace and efficiency of Breachill as well as its defensibility, chose a low-rising hill about ten miles northeast of town to build their headquarters. For decades, many citizens of the town took jobs in Citadel Altaerein, attending to the Hellknights' needs.
> In [[4682 AR]], [[Domina Arabasti|Queen Domina]] of [[Korvosa]] moved the Order of the Nail to [[Varisia]], and they relocated from Citadel Altaerein to their new home [[Citadel Vraid]]. They kept a small handful of [[Knight|knights]] at Citadel Altaerein to keep an eye out for [[Goblinoid|goblinoid]] uprisings to the southwest until [[4711 AR]], when their mounting missions in Varisia forced them to abandon their old headquarters entirely. All kinds of people and monsters have since moved into Citadel Altaerein, most notably the Bumblebrasher goblin tribe.
