*This article is on the location in [[Hell]]. For the adventure, see *[[Broken Chains]]*.*
> **Broken Chains** is the embassy of the [[Velstrac|velstracs]] in [[Hell]]. Located in the infernal city of [[Dis]] on Hell's second layer, Broken Chains is a mountainous citadel formed of massive chains. Sounds of grinding speech that emanate from within the Chains' halls have led some [[Devil|devils]] to believe that the entire citadel is a single living organism, an [[Ephialtes|ephialtes]] velstrac of unbelievable proportions.
> Broken Chains is overseen by [[Chayte|Consul Chayte]], an [[Oitos|oitos]] velstrac who represents the lords of [[Xovaikain]] on the [[Shadow Plane]].
