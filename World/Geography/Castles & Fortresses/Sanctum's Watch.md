> **Sanctum's Watch** was built to guard a pass in the Southern Range of the [[World's Edge Mountains|Worlds Edge Mountains]] in the [[Taldor|Taldan]] province of [[Ligos Prefecture|Ligos]], a purpose which it no longer serves. Sanctum's Watch is a fortress expertly hidden amongst the mountains and the valley itself was a sight of much bloodshed in the early days of the [[Grand Campaign]], when the [[Taldan Phalanx|Taldan army]] faced off against the forces of [[Qadira]]. Seen as an easy way to march an army into the soft belly of Taldor, the valley was eventually fortified, which discouraged Qadira from ever trying this approach again. Unfortunately, this led to disuse. After several centuries, Sanctum's Watch was all but abandoned, with Taldan officials even forgetting how the hidden fortress was accessed. 


## Current occupants

> Today, Sanctum's Watch serves as the seat of a petty [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]] fiefdom, which also includes swarms of [[Kobold|kobolds]] and even some [[Hill giant|hill giants]]. Unbeknownst to the current rulers, Sanctum's Watch sits atop a colossal stockpile of concealed [[Magic|magical]] siege weapons.
