> An immense fortress called **Cloudreaver Keep** guards the eastern border of the [[Alkenstar|Grand Duchy of Alkenstar]]. It is one of the three points connected by the massive [[Bridge of the Gods]], the other two being [[Alkenstar City]] and [[Dongun Hold]] on the far side of the canyon.  While the keep was intended to serve as a defense against outside threats, since its construction it has been plagued almost constantly with hauntings from [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] within and attacks from nearby bands of [[Yeti|yetis]].
> The keep stands on the western bank of the [[Ustradi River]], and all trade from [[Nex]] passes through it.
