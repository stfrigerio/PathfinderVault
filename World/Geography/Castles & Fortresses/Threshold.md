> **Threshold** was a prison tower in the High Cairns of [[Sarkoris]] reserved for those who practiced [[Arcane magic|arcane magic]]. It is now the epicenter of the [[Worldwound]].


## History

> In [[-1600 AR]] [[Frost giant|frost giants]] from the [[Northmounds]] were defeated on the future site of Threshold by [[Kellid|Kellids]] and [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of the [[Green Faith]]. The prison was built some years later to imprison arcane spellcasters, who could continue their research only under the supervision of [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] and other religious leaders. One of the prisoners, [[Areelu Vorlesh]], made a deal with the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Deskari]] and attempted a jailbreak. This eventually resulted in the [[Worldwound]] opening at that very site. Threshold straddles [[Golarion]] and the [[Abyss]].
