> The **Consortium Citadel** is located in south-central [[Diobel]]. This dockside building housing the [[Kortos Consortium]] was the tallest building in Diobel until the [[Hall of the Teriarch]] was created. Still the commercial centre of town, the large gray building is trimmed in green and a banner for each member family in the Consortium hangs in plain view. Each family with a stake maintains offices therein and all of the town's biggest trade deals are arranged in its warded conference rooms.
