> **Castle Golbanze** sits above the notorious [[Reaping Rock]] where the ruined skeletons of dozens of wrecked [[Ship|vessels]] litter the shores of [[Lake Encarthan]]. Castle Golbanze to this day guards the watery entrance to [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]] despite the city not having faced invasion from the water since the [[Shining Crusade|Shining Crusades]]. The castle bristles with siege weapons and serves as a base for much of the purple-and-black sailed Ustalavic Navy. Both Castle Golbanze and the navy are under the command of [[Marris Riddian|Admiral Marris Riddian]]. Her forces guard the citizens of [[Ustalav]] against a variety of threats ranging from [[Pirate|lake pirates]] to aquatic monsters to roving zealots from nearby [[Razmiran]]. Some of the Ustalavic Navy's most famous vessels operate out of Castle Golbanze, including the *Devilfish* under the command of [[Almira Perine|Captain Almira Cardinal Perine]]; *Princess Maraet* commanded by [[Liald Gaspair|Captain Liald Gaspair]]; and the largest [[Ship|ship]] of the navy the *Indomitable* captained by [[Leos Tailor]].
