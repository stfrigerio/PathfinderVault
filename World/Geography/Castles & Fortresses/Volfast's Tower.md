> High in **Volfast's Tower** stands the [[Undead|undead]] Volfast Raven-Banner, [[Curses of Golarion|cursed]] to forever remain at his post after he drunkenly boasted to Queen [[Sascha person|Sascha]] that, if not for his limited [[Mortality|mortal]] life, he would eternally hold back the [[Frozen Fog]] itself in the queen's name. Unfortunately for him, she granted his request, and transformed him into his current state. Here he remains until someone can defeat him in single combat. Some say that whoever defeats him would not only free him, but also inherit his cursed post, while others say they would gain a great, hidden wealth somewhere in the tower.
