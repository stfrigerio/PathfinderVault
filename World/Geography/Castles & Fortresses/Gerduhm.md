> **Gerduhm** is an extremely secret [[Dwarf|dwarven]] fortress located high in the [[Tusk Mountains]] of the [[Hold of Belkzen]], just north of the [[Gap of Valballus]] and approximately 50 miles south of the [[Cenotaph]]. It is operated by the [[Oathkeepers]], a society of dwarven priests of [[Kols]] who help maintain an ancient bloodline.



## History

> When it was obvious that the [[Sky Citadel]] of [[Urgir|Koldukar]] was going to fall, the last king of the citadel, Durlak II, entrusted the Oathkeepers with a sacred duty: protecting his daughter and the Prophecy of Ascendance. According to the prophecy a descendant of [[Taargick|King Taargick]] will one day lead their nation on a new mass migration similar to the [[Quest for Sky]] and to a new golden age. Durlak's daughter was the last of Taargick's bloodline. The priests of Kols accepted the duty and retreated to Gerduhm. The [[Orc|orc]] warlord [[Belkzen (person)|Belkzen]] besieged and took the Sky Citadel of Koldukar in [[-3708 AR]].


## Description

> The fortress consists of dozens of interconnected fortified chambers buried within the mountain without any external structure revealing its location. No roads or game trails lead to it. The only hints of Gerduhm's existence are its small front gate and a number of ventilation shafts cleverly disguised to look like natural rock.


## Inhabitants

> The descendants of the dwarves who move to Gerduhm still dwell in the fortress guarding their secrets. They have maintained the most valuable treasures of dwarvenkind for over 8 millennia. Among the sacred relics the dwarves keep in Gerduhm are the relics of King Taargick, the records of the locations of the hidden caches of armaments scattered about [[Avistan]], and the locations of all the ancient dwarven cities, fortresses, and mines in [[Nar-Voth]] and [[Sekamina]] the dwarves left behind.
> The secret order of Oathkeepers are led by [[Daras Moradan|High Oathkeeper Daras Moradan]]. He stays in contact with the other Oathkeepers who are spread among the [[Cleric|clerics]] of Kols across Avistan and [[Garund]], particularly within [[Highhelm Militia]] and among the [[Pahmet]] dwarves in [[Osirion]]. His subordinate [[Amli Faldar]] oversees the daily operation of Gerduhm. Amli is also one of the descendants of King Durlak's daughter and, because of this, has never left the hidden fortress. She is not the only descendant although the exact location of the others are known only to the other High Oathkeepers throughout [[Golarion]].
