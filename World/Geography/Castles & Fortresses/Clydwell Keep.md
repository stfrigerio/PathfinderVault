> **Clydwell Keep** is the largest and most important of the string of fortresses guarding the border between [[Mendev]] and the [[Worldwound]]. It houses the [[Artifact|artifact]] known as the *[[Demonscope]]*, and the [[Order of Holy Sentinels]] dedicated to protecting it. Like all such fortresses, it was named after a dead leader of the [[Mendevian Crusades]]—it was originally named **Corksberg Keep**—but was later renamed for [[Clydwell|Saint Clydwell]], after the *Demonscope* was placed there in [[4684 AR]].
