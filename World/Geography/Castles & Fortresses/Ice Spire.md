> **Ice Spire** is a vast [[Dungeon|dungeon]] located in the northern plains of the [[Thanelands]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. Found just south of the [[Vyalldehun River]] and close to the southern border of the [[Stormspear Hills]], Ice Spire is a singular spire that rises approximately 40 feet out of the frozen tundra. [[Adventurer|Adventurers]] tell that countless levels of dungeons and ice caves exist below the spire, most of them occupied by dangerous creatures and fearsome monsters. In the lowest levels of the Ice Spire, it is whispered that the rooms take on an altogether different and alien appearance.


## History

> The Ice Spire was once the lair of an ancient and fierce [[Linnorm|linnorm]] named [[Vyalldehun]], and many of the dungeon's denizens are still somewhat related to that [[Dragon|dragon]].
