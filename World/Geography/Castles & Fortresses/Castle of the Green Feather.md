> The **Castle of the Green Feather** was the flying castle of the [[Knight|knights]] of the [[Order of the Green Feather]]. It could easily transport legions across long distances. The castle is thought to have survived the [[Earthfall]] but shortly thereafter, the [[Magic|arcane magic]] keeping it aloft failed and the fortress crash-landed on the [[Kodar Mountains]] north-west of the city of [[Xin-Cyrusian]]. Some of the knights of the Order of the Green Feather were turned into [[Graveknight|graveknights]] and [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|liches]] upon death and today they continue to guard their sacred fortress and serve the [[Peacock Spirit]].
