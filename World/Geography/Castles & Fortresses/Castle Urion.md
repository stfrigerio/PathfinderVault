> **Castle Urion** is the first town most [[Mendevian Crusaders|crusaders]] heading to [[Mendev]] up the [[West Sellen River]] see when the enter [[Numeria]], but it is far from the typical [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarian]] settlements that are strewn across the country. This settlement is technically under the control of the [[Kevoth-Kul|Black Sovereign]], but it is in reality controlled by an order of [[Knight|knights]] dedicated to [[Iomedae]]. These knights built Castle Urion as a way to protect and guide those crusaders sailing up the [[River Sellen]] (or "[[River Road]]" as it is often called) from [[Cassomir]] in [[Taldor]] to [[Chesed]]. This order of Iomedaean knights is particularly special, as they ride trained [[Griffon|griffons]], which help them patrol vast stretches of the river, certainly more than they could if they patrolled only on horseback. The current commander of Castle Urion is [[Caroliss Minerran]].



## Geography

> Castle Urion sits on the eastern banks West Sellen River in the far southwest of Numeria, opposite the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] province of [[Varno]]. To its east lies the [[Echo Wood]] (largely within the [[River Kingdoms]]), and to its south the haunted castle of [[Bastardhall]]. The nearest upriver settlement of any size is the Ustalavic town of [[Cesca]] to the northwest. The closest one downriver is the village of [[Lockridge]] in the River Kingdom of [[Lambreth]].


## History

> In [[4629 AR]] the Knights of Urion approached the [[Traskind Elf-Eye|Black Sovereign Traskind Elf-Eye]] and requested permission to construct a military base in the southwestern corner of Numeria. The [[Paladin|paladins]]' leader swore many oaths that the proposed castle would never be used as a means to invade the ancestral Kellid lands. The intent was strictly to guard the northern part of the River Road. The Black Sovereign was initially reluctant to permit a foreign military force in his land. He gave his permission only when the knights agreed to offer the castle as a gift to him and his successors.


## Places of interest

> The town contains an active [[Pathfinder lodge]], which was established here far from the grasp of the Black Sovereign after he burned the lodge in [[Starfall]] in [[4699 AR]], accusing the [[Pathfinder Society]] of illegally stealing Numeria's secrets.
