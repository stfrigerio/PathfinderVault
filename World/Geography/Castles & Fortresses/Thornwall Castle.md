> **Thornwall Castle** is a large fortress made entirely of various thorny plants in the south of the [[Grungir Forest]], in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. It is ruled by [[Mad Jan]], the so-called 'King of Pixies' who claims to hold the loyalty of every [[Pixie|pixie]] in north western [[Avistan]]. In reality, Mad Jan's influence over his chaotic kin extends little further than nearby [[Sojourner's Rest|Sojourners Rest]]. The grounds and gardens of Thornwall Castle are claimed to have one of every plant that lives on [[Golarion]], many more from the mysterious [[First World]], and some foliage from worlds even further beyond.
