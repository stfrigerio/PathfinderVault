> [[Artokus Kirran]] discovered the secret of making the *[[Sun orchid elixir|sun orchid elixir]]* in [[1140 AR]]. The five city-states of [[Thuvia]] banded together to protect the *elixir*, and together they built a fortress in the Thuvian desert to protect the [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemist]] and his laboratories.
> This fortress is known as the **Citadel of the Alchemist**, and is carved out of the base of a mountain in the [[Barrier Wall]] known as the [[Bent Razor]]. Above ground it appears as a modest stone structure. However, below ground there are vast tunnels housing alchemical traps and guardians.  Hidden somewhere in this network are some of the best alchemical laboratories in the [[Inner Sea region]].
> The citadel houses a powerful alchemist. He has not left the citadel in living memory, but most believe him to be Artokus Kirran himself.
> Every year a blind, mute servant comes forth from the citadel with six vials of the *elixir*, to be auctioned off in one of Thuvia's five cities.
> The citadel serves as an [[Alchemy|alchemy]] school, although it is unknown how its students are chosen. Artokus Kirran teaches his alchemical lessons via Tukalo, his meerkat [[Familiar|familiar]]. Recently two [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]] sent by General [[Azaersi]] were accepted into it by Artokus, though he is keeping any motives for his decision close to his chest.
