> The **Aeon Towers** are a series of five adobe towers, four located in the [[Swardlands]] in the western [[Isle of Kortos]], and the other on the [[Isle of Erran]]. They were built early in the isles' history by [[Aroden]] to house the *[[Aeon orb|aeon orbs]]*, which [[Magic|magically]] enhance the fertility of the surrounding area in a 15-mile radius.
> Since Aroden's death, the [[Divine magic|divine magic]] that protects the towers and the *aeon orbs* has started to fail. The tower near [[Meravon]] that sustains the nearby [[Immenwood]] grows weaker every year. The tower near [[Willowside]] has lost its *aeon orb* to unknown thieves, rendering it unable to hold back the Welt: a strange environmental degradation that grows from the western part of the [[Dunmire]] a mile per year. Only three Aeon Towers now function normally, and it is unknown how long they could last before the Isle of Kortos' agricultural prosperity fails with them.
