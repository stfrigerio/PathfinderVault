 Symbol of the Order of the Rack

> The oldest of the citadels of the [[Hellknights]], **Citadel Rivad** squats in the [[Turanian Hills]] northwest of [[Westcrown]], the Twilight City and former capital of [[Cheliax]]. It is a solemn jail to heretical [[Scroll|scrolls]], quartos, and banned lore, and is zealously guarded by the [[Order of the Rack]].


## History

> Rivad began as an outpost for [[Taldan]] traders. Sometime prior to [[4580 AR]] the [[Order of the Scourge]] chose the outpost as the site for a Hellknight Citadel, and with Chelish subsidies of gold they completed Citadel Rivad at its present location in [[4580 AR]]. The Citadel itself is an imposing structure: a storm-swept edifice built from black and gray granite, personifying the Hellknight [[Philosophy|philosophies]] of discipline, [[Law|law]], and mercilessness.
> In [[4589 AR]], the Citadel was nearly destroyed by a fire that began in its main library, located in Duskmoor Tower. This tragedy is clouded further by the fact that legendary Hellknight founder [[Daidian Ruel]] was seen that night fleeing the Citadel to the northwest, leaving behind the corpse of [[Wizard|wizard]] [[Sheel Leroung|Sheel Leroungs]] most valued apprentice. This was the last known sighting of Ruel.
> In [[4639 AR]], the [[Order of the Scourge]] relocated to [[Citadel Demain]], and Citadel Rivad was handed over to the [[Order of the Rack]].
> In present day, the Citadel is under the watchful eye of [[Richemar Alamansor|Lictor Richemar Alamansor]], [[Kassir Voidai|Master of Blades Kassir Voidai]], and [[Darcyne Wrens|Paravicar Darcyne Wrens]].


## Rumors

> Citadel Rivad is built upon the foundation of the older Taldan **Fort Rivad**, and some claim that there are twisting passages and catacombs lying beneath the fortress.
> Stranger still are stories of the keep's reconstructed Duskmoor Tower, the originating point of the [[4589 AR]] fire. Eyewitnesses claim to have seen a door in the tower leading to an entire library of spectral books. The [[Order of the Rack]] has denied these claims as wild-eyed imaginings, precisely the sort of distracting and blasphemous content that the Order seeks to disabuse.
