> **Skull Hill** is a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] fort located in the southern reaches of the [[Hold of Belkzen]] in a region known as the [[Skittermounds]].
> The fortification marks the furthest extent of the [[Everwar]] campaign and the conquest of [[Cheliax]]. The fort was used for mercenary recruitment and [[Weapon|weapons]] trading. Skull Hill consists of a motte and bailey keep, surrounded by a wooden wall with a surrounding moat.
> Until recently, it was believed to have been destroyed not long after the events of the Everwar but, in fact, continued to be used as part of a spy network to monitor [[Orc|orc]] activities: an attempt by Cheliax to ensure the protection of its southern territories.
> The fortress was invaded and sacked in [[4709 AR]] by a tribe of orcs known as the Skittering Ravagers who had been terrorising the region for years.
