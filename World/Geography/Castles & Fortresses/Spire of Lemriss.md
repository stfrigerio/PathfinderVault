The **Spire of Lemriss**, also called the **Green Spire of Lemriss**, is a tree-like growth hundreds of feet in height located in western [[Varisia]] on the border between the [[Fogscar Mountains]] and the [[Churlwood]]. Its core is composed of braided and twisted wooden trunks, surrounded by arm-deep shell of vines. Countless [[Bird|birds]] and forest creatures make their home within its near-vertical structure, their chirps and hoots heard for miles around. Some believe that the spire is a cutting from the World Tree, although this has never been proven.


## History

> The spire is one of the cyclopean monuments of ancient [[Thassilon]], built with the labor of [[Slavery|enslaved]] [[Rune giant|rune]] and [[Stone giant|stone giants]]. It was located in western [[Shalast]].
