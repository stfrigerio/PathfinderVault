> The **Empty Palace of Melek Taus** is an enormous, empty steel-walled castle on the slopes of the celestial mountain of [[Heaven]] that once was the home of the [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] [[Melek Taus]]. Beautiful [[Silver|silver]] flying buttresses adorn its ramparts, decorated with [[Gemstone|gemstone]] murals showing Heaven's greatest victories against the forces of the [[Abyss]] and the [[Maelstrom]]. The palace now lies completely empty and open, with no [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Archon|archons]] patrolling its walls, but her former servants believe that Melek Taus will one day return.
