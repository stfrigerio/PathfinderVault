> **Fort Agate** was a ruined castle located on the estuary of the [[Glass River]] in [[Razmiran]]. It has since been repaired and renovated and serves as a new [[Pathfinder lodge|lodge]] for the [[Pathfinder Society]].


## History

> The fort was constructed around 500 years ago by a minor [[Varisian]] noble and his [[Kellid]] wife after they had been driven out of their home city of [[Caliphas]] due to their worship of [[Urgathoa]]. Using the fort as a base of operations, they hired bandits to attack travelers on the river and on [[Lake Encarthan]]. After their deaths, the fort fell into the hands of various bandit groups until the complex was finally cleared out by [[Razmir]] in [[4661 AR]].
> Fort Agate was left abandoned for many years until [[4720 AR]] when members of the Pathfinder Society were permitted to explore, repair, and claim the fortification as their own. After surviving an attack of [[Undead|undead]] soon after, it was converted to the Exalted Lodge.


## Geography

> The ruin was built atop a tall and narrow promontory with a spectacular view of the Glass River valley. It is located less than an hour's walk from the port town of [[Xer]].
