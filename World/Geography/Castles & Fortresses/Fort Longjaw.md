> **Fort Longjaw** is located northeast of [[Solku]], near the [[Brazen Peaks]]. It is a wooden stockade that stands as a symbol against [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]] aggression. Its proud red [[Heraldry|flag]] displays a bleached white jawbone divided by a [[Silver|silver]] [[Sword|sword]]. The fort's residents are desert warriors who dedicate themselves to driving back gnoll raiding parties, destroying gnoll settlements wherever they lurk, and hunting down any other desert dangers such as [[Hyena|hyenas]]. Led by Giana Secondstride, every day they scout the area for miles, hunting for [[Slaver|slaver]] tracks, setting up false caravans to act as decoys, and interrogating travelers about any signs of gnoll activity.
