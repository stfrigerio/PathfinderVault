> **Grayguard Castle** is the bastion fortress guarding the entrance to [[Cassomir]]'s harbour.  Its high walls and towers bristle with catapults, ballistas, and trebuchets ready to release hell to any enemy ship. It is constructed atop an outcropping of rock jutting from [[Blackwood Swamp]] and it is the highest point in Cassomir. Only a single road winds up to the gates of the castle. There was once a huge temple to [[Aroden]], situated within the castle, but now it is transformed to a multi-faith temple. A small clerical school in the temple, trains healers for duty on Taldan ships. Grayguard Castle is home to Governor [[Bozbeyli]], administrator of [[Cassomir Prefecture]]. and the official residence of the [[Grand Prince]] when he visits the city.
