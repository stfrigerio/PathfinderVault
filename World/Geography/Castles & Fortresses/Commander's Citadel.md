> The **Commander's Citadel** looms over the town of [[Fort Inevitable]]. It is home to [[Audara Drovust|Paralictor Audara Drovust]], the commanding officer of the [[Order of the Pike]]'s chapter in the [[Crusader Road]] region, as well as 40 [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]] of the Order of the Pike and a number of servants. The Hellknights of the citadel enforce the strict laws of their commander and bring authority to Fort Inevitable and the unclaimed lands of the Crusader Road. The strong octagonal citadel is more than 90 feet tall. It is incorporated into the western part of the town walls. Round turrets at the corners provide excellent defensive capabilities. The main door opens on the bailey inside the walls while a small postern that is usually locked leads outside the town wall to the shore of [[Misty Lake]].
