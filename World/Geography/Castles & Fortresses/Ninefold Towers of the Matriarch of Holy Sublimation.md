> The **Ninefold Towers of the Matriarch of Holy Sublimation** are a series of nine quartz towers located on edge of the [[Plane of Fire]] (where it borders the [[Plane of Earth]]), which are the headquarters and capital of the theocratic matriarchy that rules the [[Fire mephit|fire mephits]] of the Realms of the Living Goddess‎. The fire mephits claim the quartz was a gift from the [[Crystal dragon|crystal dragons]]; their [[Efreeti|efreeti]] neighbours allege that it was actually supplied by the hated [[Shaitan|shaitan]].


## Description

> Found on the edge of a lake of liquid copper, the Ninefold Towers are built among the ruins of an ancient [[Azer|azer]] civilization. Conquered and [[Slavery|enslaved]] eons ago by the fire mephits, their descendants still toil amongst the crystal towers. Veins of liquid copper run through the nine interlinked towers, forced to the boiling point by the intense heat near their bases. Eight lesser towers surround the massive central tower, which is the home of [[Dirimalia VI]], the Ninefold Matriarch of Holy Sublimation.
