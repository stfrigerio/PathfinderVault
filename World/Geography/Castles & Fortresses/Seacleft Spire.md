> The **Seacleft Spire** arose from the cliffs of the [[Seacleft]] in [[Magnimar]]. At this location, [[Ordellia Whilwren]] saw an angel. Upon praying to this angel during a brutal storm, Ordellia's prayers were answered by a lightning bolt that destroyed the spire and cleared the skies. The glass and rocky remains became rubble at the cliff base. The [[Arvensoar]] was built at this location to replace the spire.
