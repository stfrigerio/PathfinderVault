> The **House of Lies** is the famous meeting place of the [[Guild of Liars]], an organization of storytellers, con men, actors, and other conversational acrobats. Founded in [[4354 AR]] and located on a river island in the part of [[Nidal|Nidals]] [[Uskwood]] north of the [[Usk River]], the Guild meets here every five years to exchange stories, quips, tall tales, and other feats of verbal legerdemain. The person judged to be the most convincing liar is awarded the coveted title of "truth maker", and is given access to the House of Lies' extensive cabinet of curiosities.
