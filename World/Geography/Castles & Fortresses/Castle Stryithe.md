## Description

> The castle also features the **Hall of Peers** with its 16 traditional stations, the **Gallery of Ancestors**, a large portrait gallery, and the Royal Archives. The Castle also features a private guest wing, numerous salons and conference chambers, and uncountable alcoves and shadowy corners perfect for sinister intrigues. The palace servants also whisper of stranger features including entire hidden floors, shifting passageways, secret escape routes, and hidden oubliettes. Some have even suggested the whole palace is based around an occult design that suggests a blasphemous agenda.
