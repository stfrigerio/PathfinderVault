> **Fort Lorrin** was established by the crusaders of the [[Shining Crusade]] in [[3820 AR]] as a supply depot in the area. A watchtower of the fort was built upon the adjacent [[Watcher's Tor|Watchers Tor]]. When the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] slew [[Arazni]] in [[3823 AR]] and the crusaders were driven back in disarray, the mortal [[Iomedae]] rallied the [[Knights of Ozem]] at Fort Lorrin, and launched her famous counterattack which routed the enemies back to [[Gallowspire]], and was the beginning of the end of the tyrant in [[38' AR]].
