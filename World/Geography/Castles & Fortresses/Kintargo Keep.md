> **Kintargo Keep** is a part of the larger [[Castle Kintargo]] that dominates the [[Castle District]] of the city of [[Kintargo]]. The keep's five-storey spire juts from the north-western corner of the castle and serves as Kintargo's most notorious prison.
> Solidly built, its central staircase connects five storeys of prison above ground as well as a near-forgotten dungeon level below. Each layer has over a dozen different cells to contain prisoners and the dungeon also includes four lightless oubliettes. The site is normally very well defended, including a detachment of [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]] of the [[Order of the Rack]] led by [[Kyrre Ekodyre|Paralictor Kyrre Ekodyre]] who are accompanied by Hellknights raised from the grave as [[Phantom armor|phantom armours]].
> In the forsaken dungeon, one final guardian, is a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] [[Warpriest|warpriest]] dedicated to [[Asmodeus]], who was created in the early days of [[House Thrune]]. Barely remembered as a mere legend by most of the castle's inhabitants, this terrifying sentinel is now known only as [[First Warden|The First Warden]]. He protects a single prisoner: the legendary rebel, [[Jackdaw]], the founder of the [[Silver Ravens]]. Due to a strange quirk of city law, the dungeon level of the keep is one of the few places in the entire city that the [[Barzillai Thrune|Lord-Mayor of Kintargo]] has no right to go.
