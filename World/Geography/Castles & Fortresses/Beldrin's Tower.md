> **Beldrin's Tower** (sometimes known as the **Tower of the Broken Shield**) is the most famous monument in the [[Precipice Quarter]] of [[Absalom]]. Originally part of a three-spire [[Magic|magic]] academy established by the [[Wizard|wizard]] Beldrin, it suffered considerable damage after the earthquake of [[4698 AR]]. It now sits teetering on the cliff's edge, shaken and cracked but unbowed.
> Beldrin's Tower (as well as the shattered ruins of the other two towers) derive its name from the object of power that Beldrin sequestered within: The [[Tower of the Candelabra]], Tower of the Horn, and the Broken Shield.
> In [[4720 AR]], Beldrin's Tower was refurbished in preparation for the upcoming Radiant Festival. Before its entrance is an acres-long shallow basin, with onyx footpaths and granite benches. Massive exhibit halls on both sides of the basin host all kinds of private events throughout the day. In the foyer is a large statue of [[Aroden]] raising a [[Gold|golden]] orb from a fountain filled with prismatic water. The interior of Beldrin's Tower became a museum dedicated to notable periods in Absalom's history, where visitors can witness [[Illusion|illusory scenes]], including the construction and demolition of Absalom's curtain walls; the [[Ascension|ascension]] of [[Norgorber]], [[Cayden Cailean]], and [[Iomedae]]; and a miniature rendition of the [[Radiant Siege]].
> Even though the tower's reopening was promoted as one of the Radiant Festival's highlights, more than half of it remains blocked by locked doors, sealed off with false walls, or hidden by [[Illusion|illusion]] magic.
