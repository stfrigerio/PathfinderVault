> The **Tiered Keep** is a massive castle in [[Algidheart]], capital of the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of [[Bleakmarch]]. [[Weneschia Elvanna|Duchess Weneschia Elvanna]] and her consort, [[Pavel Elvanna|Count Pavel]], hold court in the Tiered Keep. The bureaucracy of the capital works hard in the lower levels of the Tiered Keep where the doors are only 2 feet high, forcing people to enter on their hands and knees. The exalted visitors of the keep enter via the [[Skybridge]] which connects the [[Barony]] district with the penultimate level of the keep.
> Tiered Keep also houses one of Irrisen's largest temples to [[Zon-Kuthon]], presided over by Duchess Weneschia.
