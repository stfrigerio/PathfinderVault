> **Castle Everstand** is a large, abandoned fortification in the [[Gravelands]], located just west of the northern reach of the [[Fangwood]]. It was created by [[Strom Gauntwood|Sergeant Strom Gauntwood]] as a point of defense to hold against the [[Orc|orc]] hordes from the [[Hold of Belkzen]] after Lastwall's [[Hordeline]] crumbled in [[4517 AR]]. Command was passed from [[Gauntwood family|Gauntwood to Gauntwood]] all the way to [[Thaum Gauntwood|Captain Thaum Gauntwood]], the fort's final commander when it was abandoned following [[Tar-Baphon|Tar-Baphons]] invasion of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] in [[4719 AR]].



## History

> When the Hordeline fell in 4517 AR, [[Rader-Seve|Watcher-Lord Rader-Seve]] abandoned the line and draw a new one not far west of the [[Kestrel River]] and [[Ghostlight Marsh]]. On the evening of 17 [[Arodus]], at the point where the [[Voulge Bridge]] crosses the Kestrel River, 400 orc berserkers under the command of [[Haskodar tribe|Haskodar]] Warpriest Tulkuk-Thruul were ready to descend upon Sergeant Strom and 40 of his soldiers the following morning. In the night, Strom and his soldiers using their only hope, *a deck of many things*, luckily drew cards that allowed a solid stone keep to rise out of the rocky bluff adjacent to the bridge. Strom and his soldiers fought and held their position long enough for the Lastwall's heavy cavalry to arrive. Sergeant Strom went on to the [[Crusader War College|War College]] of Vigil where his bravery earned him praise, admiration, and a larger command. Strom's daughter [[Hale Gauntwood]] was appointed commander of the **Everstand Keep‎**, as it was originally known, in [[4533 AR]]. Command of the castle was granted to the Gauntwood lineage until Castle Everstand was abandoned following Tar-Baphon's devastating destruction of [[Vigil]] in 4719 AR. This decision was reached after the commander realized his fort could no longer count on supplies and replacements from the capital.


## Description

> Legend claims that the Castle Everstand's original core was not built, but rather *wished* into being by the castle's founder, [[Strom Gauntwood|Sergeant Strom]], following the drawing of a Moon card from a *deck of many things*.
> The original keep, the impressive [[Iron Tower]] [[Magic|magically]] summoned almost two centuries ago, still stands in the center of the primary bailey atop a rocky bluff overlooking the Kestrel River. The castle has been expanded three times in its history with additional wings and outer walls.
> The first major expansion of Castle Everstand was a curtain wall off the keep along the surrounding bluff in [[4603 AR]]. Its second major expansion added a second outer wall with heavily fortified towers, this one at the base of the bluff, in [[4640 AR]]. The last expansion was completed under Captain Arald Gauntwood's supervision in [[4701 AR]], when the workers rebuilt the Voulge Bridge and constructed the [[Northwatch]], a large keep with three towers on the northern side of the river. This important accomplishment made Castle Everstand a single fortification that straddles the Kestrel River.
> Barracks, training grounds, stables, and workshops are situated inside the outer wall on the river's south side, while the village of [[Squirestone]] once contained 50 buildings that housed crafters, artisans, and farmers outside the castle's southeastern gate.


## Inhabitants

> The following is a list of two of Castle Everstand's inhabitants before Tar-Baphon's invasion:

> - [[Uskara Olym]], a woman in her mid-thirties born and raised in the castle, is the castle's master blacksmith and directs its other blacksmiths, carpenters, armorsmiths, weaponsmiths, and apprentices. She is respected by the castle's [[Knight|knights]] because of her wisdom and bravery.
> - The [[Half-elf|half-elf]] [[Basril]] is castle's houndmaster, training nearly 30 Hagarn war hounds thanks to a breeding program started by Captain Arald Gauntwood. The current castle custodian is [[Heinrich Fairstone]], who guides visitors to their correct destinations from a small stone building just inside the main gate.

### Military

> Captain Thaum Gauntwood commanded the castle's garrison of 220 soldiers, comprised of archers, foot soldiers, mounted knights, battle [[Cleric|clerics]] and more specialized combatants.
> In recent years, the talk of "defense" and "walls" has been replaced with "conquest" and "cavalry" among lieutenants and soldiers tired of waiting for the orcs to come to them. Thaum was often seen atop the Iron Tower gazing far to the west in deep thought, and a growing gulf seemed to exist between the commander and Lastwall's leaders in [[Vigil]], as Thaum suspected that Lastwall's leaders had lost their drive to push back the orcs.


### Religion

> Worship of [[Gorum]] was particularly strong in Castle Everstand. On Sundays, [[Eldia Vesan|Lady Eldia Vesan]] preached the word of [[Gorum|Our Lord in Iron]] to a congregation that included almost every man and woman in Castle Everstand. Those who frequented Gorum's chapel believed the answer to the Belkzen threat was to go on the offensive, rather than to fortify their defenses. 
> [[Lodmor Osther|Father Lodmor Osther]], an aging priest of [[Iomedae]] held frequent gatherings at the castle's church, and worried that his teachings fell on deaf ears as more devotees sought enlightenment at the adjacent temple of Gorum. Osther and his allies feared that Vesan's rousing speeches would incite a premature, foolish course of action, but he refrained from speaking of his qualms in order to maintain the cordial relations between the two churches. He did share his fears with his trusted acolyte [[Kelbie]].
