> **Nightfall Station** is the most profitable of the [[Aspis Consortium]] trading posts in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. It is thirteen days travel by wheelboat against the current from [[Bloodcove]] (assuming the travelers push on for a while after dark on the last day, and arrive at the station at night - hence the name) but the return journey with the current is only five days.
