> **Towers** is a sacreligious gambling game played with the sacred deck of cards used for the [[Harrow]] by [[Varisia|Varisian]] [[Harrower|fortune-tellers]]. The game is played with two to four players with a [[Harrow deck]]. The players lay out the neutral cards for each ability to represent the foundation of a tower, such as the Tower of Intelligence and the Tower of Wisdom. On their turn, the players try to play a card from their hand that matches the position of a card in one of the towers. Otherwise, they must "flee", paying each payer a number of coins equal to the number of cards left in their hand.
