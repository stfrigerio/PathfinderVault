 The archdevil Moloch

> The **Citadel of Flame** was the headquarters of a cult of the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Moloch]] that arose in the [[Meraz Desert]] of [[Qadira]] three centuries ago. It is located in the western Meraz Desert, near the shores of [[Obari Ocean]]. Thought to have been annihilated and covered by a stand storm, the citadel was rediscovered by the [[Pathfinder Society]] in [[4709 AR]]. Upon sending [[Pathfinders]] to investigate, it was discovered that the cult was resurgent and under the control of a powerful [[Cleric|cleric]] of Moloch named Hafshi Al-Moloch, who hoped to open a permanent [[Plane|planar portal]] to [[Malebolge]]. The Pathfinders defeated the cult and returned its [[Magic|magical]] idol of Moloch to the [[Grand Lodge]] in [[Absalom]].
