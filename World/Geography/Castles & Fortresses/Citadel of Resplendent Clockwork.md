> The **Citadel of Resplendent Clockwork** is a massive, dynamic, maze-like mechanism made of cogs, colored glass, and flywheels that serves as [[Brigh|Brighs]] realm in [[Axis]]. It is also the headquarters of her secretive collaboration with the plane's [[Axiomite|axiomites]] and [[Inevitable|inevitables]]. A set of [[Clockwork|clockwork]] portals connects it directly to [[Aktun]], [[Abadar]]'s divine realm.
