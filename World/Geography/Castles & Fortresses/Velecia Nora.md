> **Velecia Nora** is an isolated snow-covered fort made of iron and stone in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province known as [[Verge|the Verge]]. When a unit of soldiers demonstrates cowardice or disobedience, it is marched to Velecia Nora where it receives what is known as the Velecian Cruelty. One soldier in each group of ten is selected in random and beaten to the death by his nine comrades. The remaining soldiers form the new unit and return to duty. [[Necromancer|Necromancers]] raise the corpses of the killed soldiers and add them to the ranks of the [[Decimated]], a small army of [[Undead|undead]] soldiers that drill eternally in the wastes southeast of Velecia Nora. The Decimated brigade is led by the [[Graveknight|graveknight]] [[Fyodor Yelizaveta|General Fyodor Yelizaveta]].
