> The **Blue Tower** is the tallest building in [[Eastgate]] district of [[Absalom]] and among the tallest in the whole city. It is made of pieces of light blue coral, forming a spiraling horn topped with a stone lighthouse. Blue Tower is so tall that it can focus its light beyond the [[Flotsam Graveyard]] to mark a ship out of Absalom's harbor. The tower is home to the [[Winged Sandals]], an order of dedicated messengers who worship [[Iomedae]]. The Winged Sandals claim their origins back to [[Aroden]]. They say the order was commanded by Aroden himself to be ready to deliver messages to anywhere in the world. When magical means of communication don't work or are not trusted, the Winged Sandals are capable of delivering a message to any place in the world. Along with the [[Absalom Lighthouse]], the [[Spire of Nex]], and the peaks of the [[Kortos Mounts]], the Blue Tower is among the most recognizable parts of Absalom's skyline.
> Built during one of the Radiant Festivals, the Blue Tower remains a popular picnicking spot for much of the city's wealthy, as well as being a site of much mystery and danger.
