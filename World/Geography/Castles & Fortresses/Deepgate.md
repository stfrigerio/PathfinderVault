> **Deepgate** is a huge stone and [[Iron|iron]] fortress located deep in the [[Kodar Mountains]] of the [[Hold of Belkzen]], to the east of the source of the [[River Kazaron|Kazaron River]].


## History

> Deepgate was the first and greatest structure to be constructed by [[Orc|orcs]] as they emerged from the [[Darklands]] during the [[Age of Darkness]]. In a rare example of cooperation, several [[Tribes of the Hold of Belkzen|orc tribes]] banded together to complete its construction. It is somewhat unique for an orc construction, in that that it was wholly constructed by orcs, who more often reside in other races' towns and cities captured during war.


## Portal to Nar-Voth

> Deepgate is one of the largest portals to and from the Darklands, and is therefore heavily fortified against attack from above and below. When it was first built, the orcs thought they could control access to the surface of [[Golarion]] by holding Deepgate. This ultimately proved untrue, but the fortress remains an important conduit between the two realms. Control of Deepgate is hotly contested among the orc tribes of Belkzen, and ownership changes hands every generation or so.
