> **Tower Valballus** is one of only two truly defensible positions on the [[Bleakwall]] in the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] province of [[Canterwall]] on the border with the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. It is avoided by both the militia of Canterwall and the [[Orc|orcs]] of Belkzen, as it is known to be the haunt of dangerous creatures.
