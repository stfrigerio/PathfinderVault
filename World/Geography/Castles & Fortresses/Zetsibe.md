> **Zetsibe** was a treetop stronghold of [[Shory]]. It was destroyed by the [[Rovagug]] cults during the war that began in [[-2381 AR]] and lasted 10 years. The demented cults had forged an alliance with the [[Bekyar]] tribes and [[Charau-ka|charau-ka]] followers of [[Angazhan]]. The fall of Zetsibe led the Shory to create their *flying platforms* and establish an alliance with the [[Derhii|derhii]].
