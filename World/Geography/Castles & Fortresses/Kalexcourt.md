> **Kalexcourt, the Fortress of Monoliths**, or the **Vault of the Witch-Priests**, stands at the very north-westernmost point of [[Ustalav]], in the county of [[Vieland]], among the lower slopes of the [[Tusk Mountains]]. It is an ancient burial mound of the [[Kellid|Kellid peoples]] dating from before the founding of Ustalav.


## History

> Kalexcourt stands on ancient Kellid holy ground where the shamans, wise men and witch-priests of their tribes were interred. The dead Kellids fused in the earth and created a spirit of communal knowledge known as the Conclave of Ancients. When the [[Varisian|Varisians]] invaded the region in the third millennium AR, Kalexcourt was conquered and no further Kellids were buried there.


## Recent History

> In [[4422 AR]], the two brothers, [[Liron Treyes]] and [[Cadamon Treyes]], made an investigation into Kalexcourt and ended up destroying the mound. However, they found many things there of great value: golden torcs, shields with legends written on them, and strange idols. The brothers founded the [[University of Lepidstadt]] to contain these artefacts. What is significantly less well known is why the brothers' investigation led to the destruction of the mound, and also why there was such a great loss of life. The true story is recounted in Liron Treyes' secret journal: the spirit of the witch-priests was also found by the brothers and it now knows of the demise of the Kellid people at the hands of the Varisiansâ€”the destruction was actually a sealing of this mind-hungry, ancient being deep in the underground tombs before it could wreak more damage and death. It is considered that the entity discovered is a [[Charnel colossus|charnel colossus]], a colossal [[Undead|undead]] creature.
> More recent finds have been made near Kalexcourt including, in [[4702 AR]], the Six-Eye Stones; they are of Kellid provenance consistent with Kalexcourt's origins. Unfortunately, these artefacts vanished while being transported to the [[Sincomakti School of Sciences]].
> An undead monstrosity known as a [[Charnel colossus|charnel colossus]] is trapped beneath the ruins.
