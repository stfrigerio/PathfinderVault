> **Fort Indros** sits at the northeasternmost point of [[Magnimar]], amongst the riches of the [[Alabaster District]] on a spur of land that juts out into the [[Varisian Gulf]]. The fort is named after its designer [[Alcaydian Indros]], the founder of Magnimar and a watchful [[Paladin|paladin]] of [[Aroden]]. The fort gives an unmatched view of the surrounding Gulf and serves as a deterrent to any [[Pirate|pirates]] (from [[Riddleport]] or anywhere else) who might think of attacking the city. The fort bristles with siege weapons and bowmen, and is currently overseen by a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] commander named [[Vanns Wynmerd]].
