> The **Shay Citadels** is a [[Gnome|gnome]] monastery established on the island of [[Irrere]], in the [[Ironbound Archipelago]] of the [[Steaming Sea]], soon after their exile from the [[First World]]. It stands at the base of a waterfall, next to [[Irrere town|the town of Irrere]].
> The Citadels consist of a number of towers, with twisted spires of multi-coloured glass that rise above the waterfall's mists. The monastery was established for research and meditation, and is a regular destination for gnome pilgrims, especially those suffering from the [[Bleaching]].
