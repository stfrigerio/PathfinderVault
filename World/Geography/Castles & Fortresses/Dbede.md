> The tower of **Dbede** is 100 feet tall and 50 feet wide and was built by termites. It dominates the skyline near the center of the [[Screaming Jungle]] in the southern [[Mwangi Expanse]], and early explorers mistakenly assumed it marked the site of an ancient lost city. Millions of termites inhabit the tower, and they fiercely defend their home against any trespassers, as is evidenced by the thousands of clean-picked skeletons that litter the ground around it. The Screaming Jungle's intelligent inhabitants occasionally use the termites' ferocity to execute captives in a truly gruesome manner. Hundreds of similar termite mounds can be found on the [[Korir Plains]] north of the jungle, but none compares in size to Dbede.
