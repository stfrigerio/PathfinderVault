> The **El Raja Key** is one of the massive abandoned siege castles found in the [[Cairnlands]] outside the walls of the city of [[Absalom]]. It was first catalogued for the [[Pathfinder Society]] in [[4323 AR]] by the legendary [[Durvin Gest]], and was known to have been explored by [[Venture-Captain]] [[Shevala Iorae]], who recorded her findings in Volume 56 of the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]*.
