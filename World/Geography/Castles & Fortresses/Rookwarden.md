> Located in the [[Loric Fells]], **Rookwarden** is a stone and granite fortress built by [[Dwarf|dwarves]] in [[4636 AR]]. Situated on the bluff of a quarry rich with marble, this fortress is easily defended by even a small number of soldiers.  According to rumor, a secret network of tunnels honeycombs beneath the fortress and allegedly leads to entrances that could be used to take the fortress without an extended siege.
> The history of the fortress is closely tied with the [[Loric Fells|history of Loric Fells]], with a rich history of occupation, from dwarves to [[Human|humans]] to [[Goblin|goblins]] and [[Troll|trolls]].
