 Solku: the stained-glass roof of the Lambent Citadel is clearly seen towering over the town
> **Sarenrae's Lambent Citadel** in [[Solku]], is a sandstone building of graceful architecture and abstract, multicolored windows; it houses [[Sarenrae|Sarenraes]] faithful. [[Chanar Cynore|Lady Chanar Cynore]] oversees the temple's activities and distributes the collected tithes to support the poor in the city, in addition to maintaining the temple and securing the [[Weapon|weapons]] for its defense.
> The construction of the Sarenrae's Lambent Citadel began in 3722 AR directly after the successful defense against the [[Okeno Slavers]]. The leaders of the [[Sarenrae|Dawnflowers]] church convinced the people that their victory was the result of Sarenrae's renewed favor. The temple itself is only a part of a larger complex which includes small chapels for quiet prayers, housing of resident clergy and honored pilgrims, meeting rooms, libraries, a small hospital, a training ground, and a well guarded treasury.
> Day-to-day activities and the charitable works are managed by [[Noha Meerad]]. Responsible for the training and drills for Solku's guards and civilian militia is [[Adar Bilyadan]].
