> **Skyborne Keep** is an ancient, [[Magic|magical]], floating castle that was taken over by a group of [[Giant|giants]] led by the [[Cloud giant|cloud giant]] [[Lona Orames]], in [[4703 AR]], who now uses it to launch raids across [[Avistan]]. Once located in the [[Stormspear Mountains]] of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], Skyborne Keep now has no fixed location, and travels wherever Orames wishes it to go.
