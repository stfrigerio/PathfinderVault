> **Castle Kintargo** is an impressive, imposing structure that dominates the [[Castle District]] of [[Kintargo]]. Its vaunted impregnability has not been truly tested in centuries, but it is now maintained by only a skeleton staff.
> It is primarily used as the headquarters of the [[Kintargo Dottari]], although recently it has also become home to a contingent of [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]] led by [[Kyrre Ekodyre|Paralictor Kyrre Ekodyre]] from the [[Order of the Rack]] invited to the city by [[Barzillai Thrune|Lord-Mayor Barzillai Thrune]].
> Castle Kintargo also encloses the notorious prison [[Kintargo Keep]], its spires rising five stories high to the northwest of the main castle. It is much better defended than the castle itself.
