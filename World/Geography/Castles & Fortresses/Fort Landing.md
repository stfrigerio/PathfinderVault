> **Fort Landing** is a ancient, ruined stone fortress on the western coast of the [[Isle of Terror]] in [[Lake Encarthan]]. The fort has crumbled over the centuries and is now little more than a series of interconnected walls that surround a partially collapsed tower covered in arm-thick ivy. The true name of the fort has been lost to time, and its current one stems from the fact that the white sand beaches near the ruin are the easiest place to land when approaching the island from the west. The ceaselessly blowing wind blows against the fort's western wall, sometimes forming sand drifts as high as 30 feet. The [[Nightwing|nightwing]] [[Jolanera]] actively avoids Fort Landing as part of an agreement made with the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]].
