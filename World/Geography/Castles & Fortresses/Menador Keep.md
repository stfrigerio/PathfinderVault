**Menador Keep** is a two-story [[Dwarf|dwarven-engineered]] gatehouse at the narrowest point of the [[Menador Gap]], which connects the [[Chelish]] [[Archduchy of Menador|Archduchies of Menador]] and [[Ravounel]] through the [[Menador Mountains]]. The keep forms a short, artificial tunnel that bottlenecks traffic, which [[House Thrune]] staffs with loyal soldiers who exert heavy taxes and strict regulations on travel.
