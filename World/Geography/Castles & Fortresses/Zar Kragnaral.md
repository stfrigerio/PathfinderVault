> **Zar Kragnaral** is located in the [[Stormspear Mountains]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. The legendary black basalt and blue ice fortress is ruled by the so-called [[Deathless Jarl]].
> Zar Kragnaral is an imposing structure nearly seven hundred feet in height. Its windows are made of hard ice and its towers are built of black rock. Delicate bridges of ice connect its black towers. The fortress looms atop a low plateau deep in the mountains. The view from its highest towers affords a panorama of the northern [[Thanelands]] and [[Hagreach]].
