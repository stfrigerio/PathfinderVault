![[Ustalav_symbol.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 The Palace Tower forms part of the crest of Ustalav.
> Rising from the former royal demesne of Stagcrown Palace in [[Ardis]], the black **Palace Tower** was once the home of [[Ustalav|Ustalavs]] royal family. The Palace Tower was originally built by [[Soividia Ustav]] as a watchtower allowing the monarch to symbolically guard the entire nation.
> Since that time, the Tower has seen many souls pass through its walls. It was here that [[Ardurras Virholt|the Shrieking Sovereign]] hung himself above the capital in [[3206 AR]]. The Palace Tower was also host to the tragic romance of Princess Gaile Ordranti and Danstird Clase, heir to the [[Melcat|Arch-Duchy of Melcat]]. Since [[4674 AR]], when the capital of Ustalav was moved from Ardis to [[Caliphas]], no light shines within the Palace Tower and the only residents are the [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] of dead kings, forgotten nobles, and long-lost courtiers, who angrily haunt the Palace Tower's halls, resentful of the desertion of the ancient capital.
