> **Admiralty Citadel** in [[Cassomir]] is an impressive stone structure located in the southeast corner of the [[Old Cassomir]] district. The citadel is surrounded on three sides by huge towers and on the fourth by the large ramparts around Old Cassomir, and it commands an excellent view of the harbor. It was constructed by Ismacco family engineers as the home of the first governor of Cassomir, but now it is used by the [[Taldan Imperial Navy]]. Though the headquarters of the Imperial Navy are located on [[Jadrishar Island]] in [[Oppara]], most naval officers receive their training and serve out their posts at the Admiralty Citadel. The citadel is also home to Admiral [[Kasaba]], the current head of the Imperial Navy.
