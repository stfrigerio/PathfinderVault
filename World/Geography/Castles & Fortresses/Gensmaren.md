> The ruins of an ancient [[Taldor|Taldan]] supply post, **Gensmaren** is located in the [[Vergan Forest]] of [[Razmiran]] and is now the lair of a stranded group of [[Drider|driders]] who try not to attract the attention of the local [[Human|human]] authorities.


## History

> At the beginning of the [[Age of Enthronement]], Taldor's [[Second Army of Exploration]] built numerous supply forts as they moved through the area around [[Lake Encarthan]]. Many grew into villages and even cities over the following centuries, while others were abandoned and forgotten. Gensmaren, built in the Vergan Forest between Lake Encarthan and the [[West Sellen River]], was one of the latter group.
> In the early days of the [[Age of Enthronement]], a [[Witch|witch]] coven make it their home. [[Razmir]] scattered the witches when he came to power but it is said that the witches left behind [[Magic|magical]] mysteries that even Razmir was unable to reveal.


### Recent history

> The fortress now is half-collapsed, stinks or rotten, and is covered with thick webs. It is rumored to be the haunt of giant [[Vermin|vermin]], some [[Undead|undead]], and a cult of [[Demon|demon]] worshipers. The last point is actually correct, as a group of driders who revere the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Mazmezz]] has recently taken up residence there. They rarely leave Gensmaren and generally confine themselves to the extensive catacombs beneath the site, fearing to attract too much attention from the Razmiri authorities in the nearby cities of [[Pilgrimage]] or [[Xer]]. They do not know how to return to their [[Darklands]] home, as the tunnels they took to get to the surface have collapsed.
> [[Holgarin Smine]], the [[Pathfinder Society]] [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] of the [[River Kingdoms]] town of [[Tymon]], is said to have considerable knowledge of Gensmaren.
