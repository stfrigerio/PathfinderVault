> The **Tower of the Candelabra** is a ruined, flooded structure off the southern coast of the [[Precipice Quarter]] in [[Absalom]]. The other two towers are the [[Beldrin's Tower|Tower of the Broken Shield]] (colloquially known as [[Beldrin's Tower|Beldrins Tower]]) and the Tower of the Horn. 
> Originally constructed by the mage Beldrin, the Tower of the Candelabra was in fact one of the spires to a magic school that rested on the cliffside of the quarter. An earthquake rocked the district in [[4698 AR]] leading to its total collapse. The Tower sank into a deep rift that opened up a few hundred feet off the coast and is completely flooded.
> It is said that the tower contains considerable treasure, including a candelabra possessing unknown powers. Numerous attempts to explore and claim the tower have been made, notably by [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]], but this typically results in the treasure hunters' demise.
