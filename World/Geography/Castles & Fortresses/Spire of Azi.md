> The **Spire of Azi** is a temple devoted to [[Sarenrae]] and is the tallest building in the [[Karazh]] capital of [[Ular Kel]] reaching above even the colossal [[Water Houses]] that serve the ruling [[Water Lord Ular Kel|Water Lords]] as palaces. The spire can be seen from many miles away across the [[Grass Sea]] as a [[Gold|golden]] needle piercing the sky. The Spire of Azi was built atop the site where [[Goerel]], a priestess of Sarenrae, fought off a rampaging [[Azi|azi]] [[Dragon|dragon]], thus saving Ular Kel from total destruction. This act has ensured that, despite the city's general distrust of all things [[Kelesh]], Sarenrae is one of the most popular [[Deity|gods]] of the city, alongside [[Abadar]].
> The flared base of the Spire of Azi contains a beautiful temple but, nowadays, the spire is most famous for the mystics who every day climb the spire to stare directly into Sarenrae's physical manifestation, the [[Sun|sun]]. This practice results in this mystics going blind while trying to gain a greater understanding of Sarenrae's divine will. While many foreign worshippers view this practice as barbaric, none can deny the [[Oracle|oracular]] power granted to many of those mystics willing to pay the so-called "Blinding Price".
