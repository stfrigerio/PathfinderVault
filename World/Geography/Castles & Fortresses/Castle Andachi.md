> **Castle Andachi** is one of only two defensible positions on the [[Bleakwall]] that separates the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Canterwall]] from the [[Orc|orc]] [[Hold of Belkzen]]. It is located west of [[Lake Lias]] in the southern foothills of the [[Tusk Mountains]]. The castle is presumably named after [[Andachi|Count Andachi]] of [[Tamrivena]] who led a successful defense of Ustalav in the 41st century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]], before being betrayed by his head general, [[Kazavon]]. Castle Andachi is avoided by all, as it is known to be the lair of powerful creatures or haunts.
