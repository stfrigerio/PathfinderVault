> **Sky Citadels** are mighty [[Dwarf|dwarven]] fortresses that can be found throughout [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]], the first to be built by the stout folk when they emerged onto the surface world during the [[Age of Darkness]].



## History

> At the end of the Age of Darkness (ca. [[-4987 AR]]), the dwarves emerged on the surface world, ending their century-long exodus from the [[Darklands]] *(see [[Quest for Sky]])*. In order to make a mark upon their new-found home and establish an enduring dwarven presence, they built ten Sky Citadels, fortified cities and massive engineering feats. Typically metropolis-sized creations, they were decorated ornately in the dwarven fashion, and contained many murals and depictions of events from the Quest for Sky. They were almost exclusively of stone, and such is their craftsmanship that time has only slightly worn away their splendor.
> Although ten citadels were built in total, only a few have survived intact to the present day, and fewer still are held by the dwarves.  In the years following the end of the Quest for Sky, many of the cities were overcome by the very creatures of the Darklands the stout folk had displaced during their quest, especially the [[Orc|orcs]]. These battles continued for millennia, with the tides of war flowing back and forth, until a final push of orc power in [[1551 AR]] overwhelmed many of the remaining dwarven holdings.


## Surviving Sky Citadels

> Only a few of the ten original Sky Citadels are held by the dwarves today. The others lie either in complete ruin or are overrun by other creatures. Those still actively inhabited by the dwarves usually maintain connections to the Darklands realm of [[Nar-Voth]] that are all heavily guarded and patrolled. In addition, such connections are heavily reinforced by countless doors of stone, iron, and adamantine, not to mention devious traps, deadfalls, fields of fire, and sally ports.

## Lost Sky Citadels

[[Koldukar]]
Located in the [[Hold of Belkzen]], this citadel fell to the orcs in the [[Battle of Nine Stones]], and today is generally known as [[Urgir]]. Few outside the dwarven community are aware of the fact that it once belonged to the dwarves.
[[Jormurdun]]
This Sky Citadel is located in the [[Wolfcrags]], a largely uninhabited section in the northwest of the [[Worldwound|Worldwounds]] [[Frostmire]] region. The dwarves here fell to a [[Duergar|duergar]] incursion long ago. These duergar now control about a third of the city, the remainder being filled with ancient traps and guardians set by the dwarves before their defeat. The citadel is partially populated by [[Duergar|duergar]] who recently converted to the worship of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Shivaska]].

## Possible Sky Citadels

> Some claim that [[Spiro Spero]] on the [[Mwangi Expanse]] side of the [[Shattered Range]] is a ruined Sky Citadel. However, this is disputed by most dwarves as it appears to predate the accepted time period when dwarves emerged on the surface world.
