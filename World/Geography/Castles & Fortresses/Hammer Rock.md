> Located in the [[Gravelands]], the fortress of **Hammer Rock** was largely destroyed by [[Tar-Baphon|Tar-Baphons]] super-weapon known as the *Radiant Fire* in [[4719 AR]]. The foundation was a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] structure, unfinished and abandoned for unknown reasons centuries before [[Human|humanity]] moved into the region. The humans discovered the inscription "Hammer Rock" on the cornerstones and, after constructing a fort that took advantage of the dwarven foundation, named the fortification the same. Despite its whitewashed exterior, the fort looks squat and gloomy. However, being placed on a hill, the soldiers here overlook the [[Path River]] and enjoy a clear view into [[Ustalav|Ustalavs]] [[Hungry Mountains]]. Abundant small game [[Animal|animals]] and a grove of fruit-bearing trees make the location even more ideal. The ground occasionally makes loud cracking sounds, and there is little doubt that undiscovered dwarven tunnels run below the site.
