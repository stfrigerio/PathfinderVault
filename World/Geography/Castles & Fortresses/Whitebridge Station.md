> **Whitebridge Station** was an outpost of the [[Aspis Consortium]] on the [[Vanji River]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. It was located roughly 200 miles upriver from the town of [[Bloodcove]], and was a 200-foot-long fortified wooden bridge across the river with numerous wooden structures built upon it. The Consortium allowed others to use the bridge to cross the river in return for a small toll payment.
> The Consortium was breeding the [[Magic|magical]] [[Fungus|fungus]] known as [[Arcophage|arcophage]] here.


## History

> In [[4708 AR]], all of the Aspis Consortium personnel at the station were massacred by a force of [[Ekujae]] [[Elves|elves]] that included Akosa.
