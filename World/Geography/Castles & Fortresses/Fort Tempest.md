> **Fort Tempest** is a stronghold built near the [[Puddles]] district in [[Absalom]] within the [[Flotsam Graveyard]]. A family of [[Dwarves|dwarves]] built the fortress from the bones of a previous siege tower that [[Kharnas the Angel-Binder]] constructed during the [[Radiant Siege]] in [[1619 AR]].
> It is considered a "throwaway post" by the leaders of Absalom. Members of [[Starwatch]] and other guard factions in Absalom are stationed at Fort Tempest as punishment or to keep lackluster recruits busy and out of the way. It is poorly supplied due to its inconvenient location, and guards residing in Fort Tempest are better off hunting for their own food outside of Absalom rather than relying on provisions. The current commander of Fort Tempest is [[Oirel]] of House Uiry; the commander has made it a personal mission to restore the dignity of Fort Tempest and to transform the fortress's guards into an elite force.
