 Gallowspire is seen in the background.
> **Gallowspire** was the former fortress-headquarters of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]], and until [[4719 AR]] was the prison wherein the powerful [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|lich]] was confined after his defeat in [[3827 AR]] at the end of the [[Shining Crusade]]. It was located in [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Virlych]], at the center of the destroyed city of [[Adorak]], and consisted of a single tower of jagged black stone and torn [[Iron|iron]], with an extensive [[Dungeon|dungeon]] complex below. Gallowspire, which also acted as a headquarters for the [[Whispering Way]], was destroyed in [[4719 AR]] when Tar-Baphon freed himself from his imprisonment, and now only a blasted crater remains where the tower once stood.


## Description before its destruction

> The tower was constructed of dark basalt and iron, towering over 400 feet above the earth. Its outer walls are festooned with spikes and hanging chains giving the tower an appropriately grim appearance. Tar-Baphon was sealed in an underground chamber beneath the gothic tower using a powerful ward known as the *[[Great Seal]]* that no [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Magic|magic]] could penetrate. The above ground chambers of the citadel were still accessible, although they were still incredibly dangerous due to the presence of lingering magic and [[Undead|undead]]. Originally, heroic [[Knight|knights]] and [[Summoned|summoned]] [[Angel|angels]] once stood guard within the tower, intent on watching over the tomb and preventing outsiders from interfering but, over time, the intrusion of foul cultists and the unholy presence of the Whispering Tyrant, even in dormancy, destroyed them.


## Gallowspire today

> Tar-Baphon broke the *Great Seal* and freed himself in 4719 AR using the explosive power of the *Radiant Fire*, a [[Magic|magical]] weapon created from a shard of the *[[Shattered Shield of Arnisant]]*. Gallowspire was entirely destroyed in the explosion, and now only a blasted crater remains where the tower once stood. The area around the crater known as the [[Gallowgarden]] is a place suffused with Tar-Baphon's [[Necromancy|necromantic]] energy and the [[Positive energy|positive energy]] released by the detonation of the *Radiant Fire*. It is a place overflowing with twisted, dangerous [[Plant|plant]] life.
