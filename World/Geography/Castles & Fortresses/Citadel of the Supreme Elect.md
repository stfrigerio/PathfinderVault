> The **Citadel of the Supreme Elect** is a walled complex that houses the offices and residence of the [[Supreme Elect]], who is the chief executive of the democratic nation of [[Andoran]], and who also serves as the mayor of its capital city, [[Almas]]. The small keep stands near the western end of the [[Field of Concord]] in the [[Liberty District]] of Almas. The citadel is topped by a large copper dome, and guarded by a battalion of [[Steel Falcons]]. The [[House of the Demarchy Assembly]], which holds the offices of the ministers who advise the Supreme Elect, is also located within its walls, as are buildings that contain the offices of consuls, ministers, and other state officials.
