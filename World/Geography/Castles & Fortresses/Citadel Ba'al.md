> Perhaps the greatest fortress in the [[Multiverse|multiverse]], **Citadel Ba'al** is the [[Iron|iron]] fortress of the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Moloch]] spanning the entire layer of [[Malebolge]]. Made up mostly of walls surrounding countless bolgias, this infernal citadel resembles an immeasurable spiderweb. At each intersection is a fortress governed by the most martial of [[Hell]]'s nobility.
