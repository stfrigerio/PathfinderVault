> **Eleder Harbor** is a huge masterwork of old-style [[Cheliax|Chelish]] design and engineering. Wealthy merchants and other influential city folk commissioned the dredging of the new harbor in order to protect their investments in [[Anthusis|Eleder]]. The harbor can accommodate the docking requirements of large ocean-faring [[Ship|ships]] and safeguard them against attacks. At the harbor mouth, jetties slow currents and tempestuous waters, also providing the harbormaster power over ships entering and leaving the port. Within the harbor, a sprawling array of granite block piers provides docking for ships of every size from a dozen different countries. A sandy shoal divides the harbor into two main sections, separating the [[Portside Eleder district|Portside]] docks and the granite piers of [[New Haliad]] from the [[Grallus Lock]]. Grallus Lock is a large channel in the harbor currently owned by the [[Nine Forts Collective]] and converted into a private [[Slave|slave]] market.
