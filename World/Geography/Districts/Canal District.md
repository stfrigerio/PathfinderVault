> The **Canal District** is one of the sixteen city districts of [[Sothis]] and lies immediately west of the main [[Crimson Canal]] and the [[Old City]]; it is the industrial heart of Sothis. To its west are the two districts of [[Baza's Pool|Bazas Pool]] and the [[Street of Artisans]]; southwards is the seedy [[Crimson Island]]; while to the north is [[Sphinxside]]. Many smaller branch canals of the main flow traverse this district providing transport for the many industries. Unlike the Old City district, the Canal District has not been rebuilt many times, yet it is still very old; this means it retains more of an aspect of ancient Sothis: narrow and crooked streets and buildings built higgledy-piggledy.
