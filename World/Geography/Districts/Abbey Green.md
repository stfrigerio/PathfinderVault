> The **Abbey Green** district of [[Cassomir]] surrounds the ruins of [[Quickfall Abbey]]. It is located between the [[Threegates]] district to the north and the [[Imperial Naval Shipyards]] to the south. 
> Abbey Green is home to artisans, scholars, former military officers, merchants, and craftsmen. The buildings are old—constructed of stone, brick, and mortar—and are no taller than three stories. Many merchants live here in apartments above their stores.
> Most residents of Abbey Green avoid Quickfall Abbey and whisper frightful stories about it.
