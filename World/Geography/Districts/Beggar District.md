The Beggar's District in Promise is a run-down area where the poorest residents of the city live. The streets are narrow and winding, and the buildings are in a state of disrepair. Many of the buildings are made from cheap materials like mud and straw, and the smell of sewage and garbage fills the air.

Mengkare does not interact with the residents of the Beggar's District as often as he does with those in the Artist's District. The residents of this area are seen as the lowest of the low in the eyes of the rest of the city, and they are often looked down upon and ignored by those in positions of power.

Despite the difficult living conditions, the residents of the Beggar's District are a tight-knit community. They look out for one another and are quick to offer help to those in need. Many of the residents have formed small businesses, such as food stalls or makeshift shops, in an effort to make a living.

The purpose of the Beggar's District in Promise is to provide a place for the city's poorest residents to live. While the conditions in this district are far from ideal, the city does provide some basic services, such as food banks and free medical clinics, to help support the community.

One of the biggest challenges facing the Beggar's District is the lack of resources and opportunities available to its residents.

Despite the challenges, there are some bright spots in the Beggar's District. The residents are known for their resilience and resourcefulness, and many have developed unique skills or talents that allow them to survive in the harsh environment. Some residents are skilled musicians or performers, and they can often be found entertaining crowds in the city's more affluent districts.
