 An autumnal scene in the beautiful Alabaster District of Magnimar
> The richest and most prestigious district in all [[Magnimar]] is known as the **Alabaster District**. The district is home to Magnimar's elite and is cut off from the rest of the city by a large marble wall that is only interrupted by a few well-guarded sets of steps that lead to the wide avenues of the Alabaster District. The district's most prominent feature is [[Fort Indros]] which looks out north over the seas of the [[Varisian Gulf]].


## Neighbourhoods

> There are two main neighbourhoods in the Alabaster District:
