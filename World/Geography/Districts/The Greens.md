> **The Greens** is the district of [[Kintargo]] that houses the grand estates of the aristocracy that make up much of the city's social elite. The Greens are situated well north of the [[Yolubilis River]] and away from the stench of its fisheries. Most of the estates border the beautiful [[Lantana Park]], and the district is walled off from the rest of the city to ensure 'undesirables' (anyone not of the upper class) are kept out.
