> The **Tangle** is one of the three districts of the small [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] city of [[Carrion Hill]] in the otherwise swampland known as the [[Wrythe]]. The Tangle is located at the lower and middle heights of the hill. It is a thick tangle of buildings and narrow alleyways where most of the shops and residences can be found. The twisting mass of alleys, dead ends and lightless streets serve as the arteries and veins of the most crowded district of the city. The claustrophobic houses towering over the narrow black footpaths are made of wood, stone, and cheap middenstone. A traveler without a guide could easily be lost and become a victim of thugs and cut-throats. The small shops in the narrow streets of the Tangle district sell everything and the locals often gather in street corner [[Coffee|coffee]] houses to smoke strange aromatic [[Tobacco|tobacco]] with their long hookah pipes.
