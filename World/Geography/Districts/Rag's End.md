> The poorest, most wretched area in all [[Magnimar]] is found in the [[Beacon's Point|Beacons Point]] city district and called: **Rag's End**. Its desolate tenements are a far cry from the city's grand title as "The City of Monuments". The maze-like alleys and slums of Rag's End are home to only the most desperate of Magnimar's working class as well as a host of homeless people, addicts, cripples and vagrant wanderers. Most people only get by through begging, temporary work and the charity of the churches of [[Iomedae]] and [[Erastil]]. Much of this desolate slum is owned by a much loathed [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisian]] slumlord named [[Rassimeri Jaijarko]], who uses the [[Sczarni]] gang [[The Gallowed]] as his hired muscle.
