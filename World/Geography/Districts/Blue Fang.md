> The **Blue Fang** district of the town of [[Redtooth]], provincial capital of the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province known as the [[Verge]], hosts nearly half of the [[Winter wolf|winter wolf]] population. They live in homes like those of their [[Human|human]] neighbors, complete with gated entryways. The only inn in town, the [[Open Claw]], is also found in Blue Fang: it is a large building without any gate, run by silver-haired Emylla Grigovych who is friendly to her visitors.
