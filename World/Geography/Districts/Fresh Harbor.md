> The **Fresh Harbor** is the inner harbor of the [[Andoran|Andoren]] city of [[Augustana]] on the northern coast of the [[Inner Sea]]. It gets its name from the fact that its water is fresher (*i.e.* less saline) than that found in the outer harbor, known as the [[Great Salt Harbor]]. This is due to the fact that the Fresh Harbor is immediately next to the mouth of the [[Arthfell River]]. The Fresh Harbor is separated from the Great Salt Harbor by two small peninsulas as well as two low bridges ([[Fleet Bridge]] and [[Market Bridge]]) and is only accessible by small [[Ship|ships]]. Fresh Harbor is encircled to the east by the [[Copperdown District]] and to the west by the [[Fleet District]].
