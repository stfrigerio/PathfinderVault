> The **Wharf District** of [[Riddleport]] is located just north of the [[Riddleport Harbor|Riddleport Harbors]] docks. Much of the city's commercial action and thievery occurs in this district. Nearest the docks are several warehouses and cheap [[Grog|grog]] shops. It was once the center of commerce but much of the action has moved to the [[Free-Coin District]]. Inns and shops have grimy windows and peeling paint hinting at a prosperity that no longer exists.
