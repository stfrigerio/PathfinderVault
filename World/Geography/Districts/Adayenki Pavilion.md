> The **Adayenki Pavilion** is an extensive common area in the Central Market of the large town of [[Kibwe]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. A wall of huge tapestries, rugs, and skins strung upon large totemic posts separates the area from the rest of town. It is used mainly for a common area for religious services, extensive celebrations, community prayers and large ceremonial weddings. The blocks around the pavilion host caravans and stalls trading goods from every corner of [[Garund]] and beyond.
