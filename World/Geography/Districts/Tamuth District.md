> The **Tamuth District** is home to [[Almas]] least desirable jobs and poorest citizens. It is bisected by [[Balmore's Canal|Balmores Canal]] in the southwestern corner of the city, and is bordered by the [[Andoshen River]] to the east and the [[Tamuth River]] (from which it gets its name) to the north. The [[Iron and Hoof Gate]] connects the Tamuth with the trade routes beyond the city, and provides the main way in and out. The neighborhoods of the [[Bellows]], [[Smithtown]], and [[Mugget]] are all located within this district. The streets of the Tamuth District are largely unpaved but very wide, so as to better accommodate the large wagons and heavy draft animals who transport the goods in and out of the neighborhood. During times of heavy rain, however, the streets become an impassable morass, much to the chagrin of the local inhabitants.
