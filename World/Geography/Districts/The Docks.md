> **The Docks** is not only a physical location in the city of [[Absalom]], but also an official [[City districts of Absalom|city district]]. As most travelers arrive in Absalom by ship, the Docks is the first part of the city they see. Hundreds of maritime vessels arrive and depart from the Docks every day, and it is a bustling area where longshoremen constantly load and unload cargo destined for Absalom's markets and elsewhere.  The district itself is a rather rough place, as the [[Harbor Guard]] (the district guard) tends to turn a blind eye to most brawls and the like as long as things don't get out of hand. Young touts are found nearly everywhere, announcing the services of all manner of businesses. These include a number of cheap waterside taverns and brothels located here.


## Government

> Like every other city district in Absalom, the Docks are goverend by a district council. It is called the Dock Council and is headquartered in Crestwatch, one of the 10 tallest buildings in the city. The current [[Nomarch|nomarch]] of the Dock Council is [[Archych of House Dureanz|Lord Archych of House Dureanz]].


## Places of interest

> Just off the shoreline in the Bay of Kortos lies a maze of scuttled and half-sunken shipwrecks known as the [[Flotsam Graveyard]]. Most of the wrecks are here as the result of one of the many failed invasions of the city (*see [[History of Absalom]]*), but they now serve a defensive purpose, guarding Absalom from an invasion by sea.
> Two world-class shipyards are located in the Docks: the [[Devil's Own|Devils Own]] and the [[Sea King Shipyard]].
> The largest crane in the world, known as the [[Beast crane|Beast]], is located at the Long Pier, near the center of the Docks. The Beast is used to unload the heaviest and largest loads in Absalom.
> The [[Grog Pit]] is the most notorious tavern and flophouse on the docks.
> A simple stone building, [[Ogrekin business|Ogrekin Hall]] is the home of the Ogrekin, a transporting business. Ogrekin can transport anything to anywhere within Absalom.
> The Pickled Imp is a curio shop operated by [[Guaril Karela]].
