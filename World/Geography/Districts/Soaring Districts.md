> The **Soaring Districts** of [[Algidheart]], as they are collectively named, are the eight districts at the city's center where [[Jadwiga]] and wealthy foreigners live. 
> The eight Soaring Districts are:

> - the [[Hanging Markets]] at the city's very center;
> - the [[Barony]] district, home of the middle class Jadwiga close to Duchess' [[Tiered Keep]];
> - the [[Winghammer]] district, home to the oldest Jadwiga families;
> - the [[Helcotte Wedge]], home to more recent Jadwiga families;
> - the [[Cloudkeep Aerie]] district, home to more recent Jadwiga families;
> - the [[Bloodmerchant Towers]] district where rich foreign merchants dwell;
> - the [[Witchspire]] district, home to monstrous population like [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]] and cold [[Fey|fey]];
> - the almost deserted [[Fyodov's Wedge|Fyodovs Wedge]] district.
> The buildings in the Soaring Districts are built one on top of another, in structures that seem improbable and always on the verge of collapsing. Yet not a single building has collapsed in the Algidheart's history. These extremely high structures are connected by a labyrinth of stairways, ramps, bridges and platforms. Algidheart's peasants and slaves live in the districts surrounding the Soaring Districts.
