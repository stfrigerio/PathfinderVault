> **Pinkskin** is the district of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Urglin]] that is most hospitable to non-[[Orc|orcs]]. It is the smallest of the five neighborhoods (the others being [[Warmouth]], [[Bonerattle]], [[Oozefront]], and [[Scabtown]]), and is largely composed of tents and yurts. Most of the [[Human|humans]] who live here are exiled [[Shoanti]], desperate mercenaries, and other rough folk who truly have nowhere else to go. Compared to the other districts, **Pinkskin** is the friendliest to outsiders of the city, but discrimination is still heavily prevalent.
