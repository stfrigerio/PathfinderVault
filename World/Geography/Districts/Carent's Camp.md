> **Carent's Camp** is a [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisian]] tent camp in the [[Dockway|Dockway district]] of the city of [[Magnimar]]. It is run by [[Donal Carent]], leader of the  [[Wreckwash Blades]], a [[Sczarni]] gang that specializes in information gathering and trade. The camp contains numerous tents and other temporary structures, although Donal Carent reserves the best one for himself. Carent's Camp also recently was home to the [[Tower Girls]], another Sczarni gang who was forced out after a disagreement developed between them and the Wreckwash Blades.
