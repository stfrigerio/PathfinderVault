> The home to some of [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] most important buildings, the **Capital District** serves as the political heart of the entire city; it is sometimes referred to as the **Artisan's Quarter** or the **Irespan District**. It lies in the [[Summit Magnimar district|Summit]] region of Magnimar and is north of the "new-money" area of the [[Naos]]. The buildings of the area are as ornate as they are important, the [[Usher's Hall|Ushers Hall]], which sits opposite the monument known as [[Indros cul Vydrarch]], is home to the [[Council of Ushers]] and is the place where many of the city's most important decisions are made. Nearby stands the [[Pediment Building]], the home of justice in Magnimar; the above ground floors are home to stern faced judges and large courtrooms, while below the ground is Magnimar's main prison, the [[Hells]].
