> The **Empire Gate** serves as the western city gate of the [[Karazh]] capital of [[Ular Kel]]. Formally known as the "**Gate of Failed Empire**" it is named in mocking reference to the [[Kelesh|Padishah Empire of Kelesh]] to which the caravan road that leaves through it eventually connects. Despite the massive military might of the Padishah Empire, they have never been able to successfully take Ular Kel but not for lack of trying.
