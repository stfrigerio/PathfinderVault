> The **Highside Stacks** is an upper-class neighborhood within the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]].  Here the rich dwell in tall buildings overlooking the Core Districts, far removed from the chaos which characterizes the rest of the city.  Some of the inhabitants of the Stacks sequester themselves completely from their neighbors, handling all day-to-day necessities through servant intermediaries.
