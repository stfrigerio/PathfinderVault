> **Eastport** is the smallest of [[Oppara]]'s two ports. It is separated from [[Westport]] by the structures of the [[Grand Bridge of the Empire]]. It receives river traffic coming in from as far away as [[Sardis Township]] in the [[Porthmos Gap]]. The district around the docks is poor, with buildings made of wood. Eastport district has burned to the ground two times in the last hundred years.
