> The **Embassy District** in [[Almas]] houses diplomats of the nations that recognize [[Andoran]] as a sovereign power. The embassies are walled and well guarded by their own security forces, while the city watch patrols the streets under the command of [[Lassila Karan]]. Even though the grounds of the embassies are considered the sovereign territory of their respective nations (and are therefore subject to only their own laws), [[Slavery|slavery]] is still illegal anywhere in Almas. Their architectures are characteristic of their national architectural styles.


## History

> The large embassies were once the homes of wealthy nobles whose properties were nationalized after the [[People's Revolt|Peoples Revolt]].
