> The city district known as **Dockway** forms the heart of [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] maritime activities, nestled round the shore of [[Outcast's Cove|Outcasts Cove]] in the city's [[Shore Magnimar district|Shore]] region. It sis sometimes referred to as the **Eagle's Quarter**, or as the **Trade District**. Dockway never sleeps.  The constant flow of trading [[Ship|ships]] and local fishing vessels keep the docks busy at all hours. Much of this part of the city is home to businesses that cater to the hardy sea folk who spend their earnings here. A few blocks inland from the salt-soaked dock fronts, there are a host of more comfortable inns and taverns that try to cater to the exotic tastes of Magnimar's foreign visitors. The most famous of these Dockway sanctuaries is probably the [[Fang]], a cheap dockside inn run by [[Ol' Mam Grottle|Ol Mam Grottle]], its no nonsense proprietress.
