> The **Highwall Market** stands before the towering walls of [[Castle Kintargo]] in [[Kintargo|Kintargos]] [[Castle District]]. Highwall Market primarily serves the inhabitants of the castle, selling supplies of paper, ink and other mundane essentials to bureaucrats of all stripes. The Highwall Market also offers other distractions for the weary workers who frequent it, with food stalls and masseuses peppered across the market. At its centre stands a statue of the ancient war hero [[Tellorus Carmus]].
