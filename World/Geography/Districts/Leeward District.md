> The **Leeward District** of [[Riddleport]] encompasses the northeastern section of the city. Cradled within a rocky spur of the [[Calphiak Mountains]], it is protected from the worst of the weather. Leeward is the primary residential district of the city, although many tenement buildings also have a shop on the ground floor.
> [[Prostitutes]] are most common in the streets and squares of this district, enticing customers to accompany them to the [[House of the Silken Veil]].
