> The **Castlegate** is one of four gates that pierce the city wall of [[Magnimar]] sitting at the border between the [[Keystone]] and [[Lowcleft]] districts of the city. While Castlegate is not as large as the [[Twins' Gate|Twins Gate]] in the [[Grand Arch]] district it is the busiest of all the city gates and is often the first sight that a land bound trader sees when he enters the city. The Castlegate is so busy that it is directly responsible for almost all of the hustle and bustle of [[The Marches]].
