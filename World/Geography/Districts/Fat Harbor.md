> [[Pezzack|Pezzacks]] harbor, **Fat Harbor**, is clogged with the more than 100 [[Ship|ships]] scuttled or destroyed during the [[Chelish Navy|Chelish Navys]] blockade of the city. The stranded crews and town's residents converted the morass into Docktown, an improvised and chaotic floating mercantile district.


## History

> Fat Harbor has long been a point of contention between Pezzacki fishermen and the native [[Strix|strix]], who claim the harbor as their traditional fishing grounds. The Chelish blockade only exacerbated fishing in the harbor, resulting in depleted stocks.
