> The **Lionsgate** district of [[Oppara]] has grown around the breathtaking structure of the [[Lionsgate]]. it is hedged in by the two branches of [[Central Canal]] and is mainly a market district, noisy during the day, ringing with the calls of barkers and the clang of smithies, smelling of boiled leather and butchers' blocks. Most of the traders in the district live in small apartments above their workspace and shops. The buildings are made of ornately carved stone, but they are tightly packed together and line narrow paved streets.
