> The **Deepmarket** exists beneath the lowest levels of the [[Undermarket]] but just above [[Nar-Voth]] proper. The Deepmarket functions as a shadowy community all its own, deep beneath the [[Goka|City of Wonders]]. Its inhabitants include a wide range of races from the [[Darklands]] (with which the Deepmarket connects) including: [[Ysoki|ratfolk]], [[Caligni|caligni]], [[Xulgath|xulgaths]], [[Wayang|wayangs]] and more.
