 The ward of Bridgefront, in [[Old Korvosa]].
> **Bridgefront** is the poorest ward in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]] lying in the district of [[Old Korvosa]]. It lies on a tiny sliver of land between the imposing [[Garrison Hill]] to the north, and the [[Narrows of Saint Alika]] to the south, barely three streets deep; to the east lies the larger ward of Old Dock. When its inhabitants ran out of new real-estate long ago, they began to build up, constructing shabby, wooden lean-tos on top of existing buildings. These flimsy floors were eventually connected to each other via ladders, ropes, and long poles, even across city streets, and grew into a new pseudo-district known as the [[Shingles]].


> [[Paizo]] has published a Gazetteer of Bridgefront and a poster map in *[[The House on Hook Street]]*.
