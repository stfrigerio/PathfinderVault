> **Keelwrack Harbor** dominates the city of [[Vyre]], stretching between the islands of [[Dunrock]], [[Keelwrack Island]], and the shore district of [[Vise|The Vise]]. Keelwrack Harbor is very shallow, requiring most waterborne traffic crossing the harbor to use shallow bottomed [[Barge|barges]], [[Skiff|skiffs]], or [[Rowboat|rowboats]] and earning the harbor its name. This shallowness has historically served to protect Vyre against invasion from powerful nations like [[Taldor]] but has done little to protect against raiders from the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] in their shallow bottomed [[Longship|longships]].
