> The **Street of Artisans** is one of the sixteen city districts of [[Sothis]] lying on the west of the city. To its north is the less successful [[Sphinxside]]; to its east is the industrial [[Canal District]]; while to the south lies the prosperous [[Baza's Pool|Bazas Pool]] district. True to its name, the district is the centre of craftsmanship for the city, for example, successful metalworkers, furniture makers and sculptors reside here. Their artwork is traded throughout the city and beyond. Additionally, the district contains many specialists of the [[Art|art]] and architecture of [[Ancient Osirion]]: scrupulous experts among their number can fabricate excellent reproductions of archaic items from the time of Ancient Osirion; though their less scrupulous colleagues might use such wares in order to dupe customers into believing the wares are actually authentic antique pieces.
