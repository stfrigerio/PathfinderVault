> **Bliss** is one of the main districts in the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Vyre]] and is what most people are thinking of when they conjure a mental image of the sin-soaked City of Masks. Bliss is comprised of three smaller neighbourhoods: [[The Cradle Vyre|The Cradle]], [[Nightcrown]], and [[Sanctuary Vyre|Sanctuary]], each of which is filled with the debauched gambling halls, [[Drug|drug]] dens, fighting pits, and [[Prostitution|brothels]]. The actual businesses themselves change at a breakneck pace as one sordid establishment replaces another in an endless chain of vice.
