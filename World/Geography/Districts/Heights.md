 The Heights District is seen in the middle of this picture of the city of Korvosa and includes the Grand Mastaba and the Acadamae on top of Citadel Hill.
> The **Heights District** gets its name from the fact that it is located at the highest point in [[Korvosa]], built upon Citadel Hill. Most of Korvosa's elite reside here, wishing to be close to the court at [[Castle Korvosa]] and to literally and figuratively look down at the rest of the city.
> There are three wards in this district:

[[Citadel Crest]]
This is the wealthiest ward of Korvosa, being the residence of nobles and rich merchants.
[[Cliffside]]
A step down in wealth from Citadel Crest is Cliffside, where many lesser nobles and wealthy merchants make their home.
[[University ward|University]]
Named after the [[University of Korvosa]], which is found here, this ward is dominated by scholastic institutions.
