> The **Bekyar Block** in the city-state of [[Kibwe]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] is controlled by [[Bekyar]], who once used it to accept bids from international buyers and arrange the delivery of [[Slave|slaves]] despite the disdain of the majority of the city's council.
> Active slave-taking has long been outlawed within the town and the surrounding area, so Bekyar's caravans and slave chains used Kibwe only as a waystation. However, the city's ruling council recently outlawed all forms of slavery within the city, which has roiled unrest in the Bekyar Block.
> [[Clatriani Orridik]] is the Bloodman of Bekyar Block.
