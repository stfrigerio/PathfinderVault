> The former residence of [[Ordellia Whilwren]] sits very close to the [[Rose and Rake Theatre]] in [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] [[Ordellia|Ordellia district]]. It has been unoccupied since Ordellia's death, and is currently held in trust by the [[Wardens of the Eye]], her former adventuring associates. The townhouse is commonly known to be haunted.
