> **Devil's Dance** is a district in the north-western portion of the city of [[Egorian]] in [[Cheliax]]. The district is awash with money, both old and new; young patriotic nobles frequent the inns and taverns here. Due to the arrangement of streets into a pentagram, [[Conjurer|conjurers]] and [[Diabolist|diabolists]] often rent out lofts in the hope that the district's layout will empower their [[Infernal|infernal]] [[Magic|magic]]. The rooftops are infested with [[Imp|imps]], which hide during daylight hours to avoid recapture or banishment to [[Hell]].
