> The **Bellows** is a majority [[Dwarf|dwarven]] neighborhood in the working-class [[Tamuth District]] in the southwest of the [[Andoran]] capital of [[Almas]]. It is bordered to the north and east by the [[Tamuth River]], to the south by the industrial [[Smithtown]] neighborhood, and to the west by the city wall. The dwarves who live here largely work in Smithtown or run small businesses in Bellows where they work as masons, gem cutters, and silversmiths. Most are directly descended from the refugees who fled the destruction of [[Tar Khadurrm]], the once mighty dwarven nation shattered by the eruption of [[Droskar's Crag|Droskars Crag]] in [[3980 AR]]. The dwarven population here has slowly been dwindling over the past few centuries, and now numbers fewer than 100 individuals under the leadership of [[Elgrid Twelvehammers]], a [[Cleric|priestess]] of [[Torag]]. Recently, [[Human|humans]] wishing to apprentice themselves to the highly skilled dwarves have begun moving into the neighborhood, and if they remain, it is only a matter of time before the demographics of the neighborhood changes significantly.
