> The **Crown** is one of the three districts of the small [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] city of [[Carrion Hill]] in the otherwise swampland known as the [[Wrythe]]. The Crown is located atop the hill and is the home of Carrion Hill's nobility and most of the government and public buildings. The cobbled streets are broad and bleached white. The buildings are large and made of stone and timber. Lavender plants grow in and around the olive trees that thrive on the high hill. The wealthy citizens dwelling in the Crown enjoy the lack of taxes the city grants. A vast number of crows frequent the top of the hill.

> - [[Ossuary Church]]: the largest church in Carrion Hill, run by the priesthood of [[Pharasma]]
