> **The Marches** serve as the entrance to [[Magnimar]] for most of the land-bound traders who enter the city. The [[Castlegate]] is the first sight many traders see when approaching Magnimar and is one of only four gates which penetrate the city wall and is almost as large as the [[Twins' Gate|Twins Gate]] in [[Grand Arch]]. The Marches are west of [[Lowcleft]] and east of the wealthier [[Silver Shore]] neighbourhood. The Marches are home to many content but not particularly wealthy folk: lower class shop owners and less skilled craftsmen. The Marches, thanks to the location next to Castlegate, are quite a busy district bustling with traders, but the neighbourhood is given no extra funding for security: it is filled with [[Sczarni]] gangs and other such thieves and conmen. Luckily the local churches of [[Iomedae]], [[Erastil]] and [[Abadar]] all provide manpower that helps keep the district safe, or at least safer than it would be.
