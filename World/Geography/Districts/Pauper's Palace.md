> **Pauper's Palace** is the largest district in the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Vyre]] and covers all of its residential neighbourhoods. Pauper's Palace serves the city's residents as an escape from the hustle, bustle, and sheer debauchery of districts like [[Bliss]] and the [[Vise]]. The application process to become a citizen of Vyre is long and arduous but the city does not discriminate making Pauper's Palace a place of incredible diversity with people of every species, race, religion, sexual orientation, and political persuasion. Pauper's Palace consists of several different neighbourhoods, the richest of which are [[Sunshade]] and [[Westwatch]], followed by the more middle-class [[Duskwalk]], [[Graystone]], and [[Nettles]], and the city's largest slums [[Whispers]]. The centre of Pauper's Palace is its largest neighbourhood, the [[River District Vyre|River District]].
