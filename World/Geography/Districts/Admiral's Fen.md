> **Admiral's Fen** district built as an expansion of [[Cassomir]] after the construction of the [[Imperial Naval Shipyards]]. The land was reclaimed from the [[Blackwood Swamp]] by draining a portion of it into the brackish moat that surrounds the city. Streets, buildings and sewers were constructed, but the new district quickly began to lose ground to the ever-expanding swamp. The streets long ago sunk, many buildings crashed in muddy ruins, and the air became a perpetual swamp-stink of wet mud, rotting vegetations and murky pools of water. There are efforts to keep the district as dry as possible but it is a losing battle. Today Admiral's Fen is home to lower-class craftsmen, dock workers, and thugs.
