> The **Sandpoint Lumber Mill** is located on River Street on the banks of the [[Turandarok River]] in the town of [[Sandpoint]].  It is owned by the wealthy Scarnetti family who controls Sandpoint's lumber industry, and was one of the first buildings built during the founding of the town.  The mill is run by [[Ibor Thorn]] and was the sight of a grisly ritual murder in [[4707 AR]], when Ibor's partner [[Banny Harker]] was brutally murdered with his girlfriend [[Katrine Vinder]].  After some investigation it was discovered that they had been killed by the former (now dread ghast) [[Aldern Foxglove]] in an effort to fuel his master, [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Karzoug]]'s [[Runewell|runewell]].
