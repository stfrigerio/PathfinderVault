> **Worldbreaker Hill** district is named after the famous magical siege engine of the [[Army of Exploration|5th Army of Exploration]]. The [[Worldbreaker]] used to rest on top of this district's hill, guarding the western river approach to [[Oppara]]. The Worldbreaker was pulled up out of its foundation to be used by the [[Army of Exploration|6th Army of Exploration]] and now only its enormous foundation remains on the hill. The Worldbreaker Hill district is next to [[Senate's Hill|Senates Hill]] district and home to many of [[Taldor]]'s military officers.
