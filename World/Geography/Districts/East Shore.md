 East Shore is seen as the enclosed district on the near side of the river in this picture of the city of Korvosa.
> **East Shore** is the only [[Korvosa|Korvosan]] city district located on the far side of the [[Jeggare River]]. It is connected to the rest of the city by [[High Bridge]], and is home to a number of Korvosa's noble families with strong ties to the military. It is also the location of the city's second, and arguably inferior, [[Magic|magical]] school, [[Theumanexus College]].
