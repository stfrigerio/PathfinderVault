> The **Gilded Cage** is renowned as [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] most decadent night spot. A garishly decorated club in [[Lowcleft]] that is built directly into the cliffs of the [[Seacleft]] itself, the Gilded Cage is known throughout the city. It is run by a former *prima donna* of the more classy [[Triodea]] theater called [[Jayleen Mordove]] who, despite her role as a night club owner, still maintains many connections with the city's artistic elite.
