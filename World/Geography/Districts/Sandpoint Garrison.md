> The **Sandpoint Garrison** serves the community of [[Sandpoint]] as both a prison and barracks, and is administered by Sheriff [[Belor Hemlock]]. Though the Garrison is populated by more than two dozen individuals, and acts as a rallying point for the town's additional militia members, there is rarely any need to rally the full compliment of defenders housed within the building's wall's.



## Appearance

> The Sandpoint Garrison is a sturdy stone building. In addition to the above ground structure, which acts primarily as a barracks, a subterranean section acts as Sandpoint's jail.


## Services

> In addition to housing Sandpoint's full-time guardsmen, and their support staff, the Garrison acts as a training location for the community's militia. The jail wing generally acts as only a temporary holding location; those within are either released fairly quickly or transported to [[Magnimar]] for trial.


## Notable Individuals
