> **Harbor Watch** consists of three enormous towers opposite [[Grayguard Castle]] across [[Cassomir]]'s harbor constructed by Ismacco family engineers. A thick curtain wall connects the high primary tower to the other two. All of them stand ready with ballistas, catapults, and trebuchets, to defend the harbor from enemy [[Ship|ships]]. A heavy chain runs out of the base of the southernmost tower, goes underwater, and is anchored to a buried bunker on the beach of the Grayguard Castle. It is said that the chain can be lifted from the sea bottom by an enormous winch in the basement of Harbor Watch in order to seal the harbor.
