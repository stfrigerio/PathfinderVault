> **Outcast's Cove** forms the natural harbour at the centre of [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] naval power.
> Outcast's Cove is one of the most important features of Magnimar, even if it is not as prominent as the [[Seacleft]] or the [[Irespan]]. Along its shores lie the bustling markets of the [[Bazaar of Sails]], the salt-soaked [[Dockway]], and the raucous [[Beacon's Point|Beacons Point]]. The cove even features in the legend of [[Alcaydian Indros]]; according to the stories, it was on the shores of Outcast's Cove that Indros vanquished the serpent [[Vydrarch]] and founded the city.


## History

> Before the impact of the [[Starstone]] redrew [[Varisia|Varisias]] coastline, Outcast's Cove was actually a freshwater lake unconnected to the waters of the [[Varisian Gulf]].
