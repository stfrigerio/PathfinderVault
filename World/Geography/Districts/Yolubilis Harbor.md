> **Yolubilis Harbor** came in to existence as [[Kintargo]] grew as a city and became in need of increased moorings. The original harbour, now called [[Old Harbor]], sat within [[Old Kintargo]] and was much too small to support the growing economy of Kintargo. Thus, Yolubilis Harbor was built along the north shore of the [[Yolubilis River]] where the waters were deep and calm. The district is now host to many drinking establishments like [[Clenchjaw's|Clenchjaws]] and [[Thrashing Badger|The Thrashing Badger]], lots of industry, and the northern end of the [[Bleakbridge]].
