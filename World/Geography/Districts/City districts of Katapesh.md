> The city of [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]] is divided into five separate areas: Dawn Gate, Docks, Inner City, Lower City, and Twilight Gate. Three more smaller communities shelter in the shade of the city's tall walls. Dog Town huddles around the Dawn Gate. The Daystalls located outside of the Serpent Gate and the Sprawl near the Twilight Gate. A fourth community outside of Katapesh's walls, Castle Glarion is located just south and east of the Sprawl and has attracted neighbors and a few shops. The [[River Scorpius]] wends its way through part of the city, passing through the Serpent Gate, exiting into the Sprawl, and flowing out into the [[Obari Ocean]].



## Dawn Gate

> Dawn Gate grew up around the original city walls during the Oasis Age when Katapesh was flooded with newcomers. It is home to many wealthy business owners and upper-middle-class residents. Several notable places exist within the Dawn Gate district.

## Docks

> At the Docks there are over a dozen, long, maze-like piers, each of them capable of holding numerous vessels. Warehouses, stores, and a few sizable inns cater to the city's bustling sea trade. Huge crenelated towers flank the Docks. A 40-foot tall massive statue of a horned giant with a trident, rising from the shoreline, seems as if to ward away enemies coming from the sea.
