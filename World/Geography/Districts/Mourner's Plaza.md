> **Mourner's Plaza** is the name given to the area surrounding the [[Cenotaph Magnimar|Cenotaph]] monument in [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] [[Bridgeward]] district. Mourner's Plaza gained its name thanks to the tradition of the city's elite wanting to be buried near the Cenotaph; this has lead to the creation of a huge maze of catacombs that run beneath the entire plaza and has led to its current name.
