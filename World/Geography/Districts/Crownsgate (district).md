> **Crownsgate** district of [[Oppara]] is a poor district, mainly filled with vanal warehouses and factories. It is named after Oppara's secondary gate. The cobblestones that once paved its side streets have long since been torn up and now are just hard-packed earth. Crownsgate is dangerous at night, with its back alleys filled with cutthroats, purse-snatchers, prostitutes, and thieves of the [[Brotherhood of Silence]]. This influential thieves' guild controls most of the district.
