> **Aru-Da** is the northernmost of the sixteen city districts of [[Sothis]] lying on the east bank of the [[Crimson Canal]] in lower Sothis; it is one of the wealthy, peripheral suburbs of the city. Like the other rich, peripheral suburbs, Aru-Da contains large oasis circles; wide, tree-lined streets; and excellent facilities for its inhabitants. These residents include wealthy merchants and craftsmen, civil servants and even nobles dwelling in their mansions.
