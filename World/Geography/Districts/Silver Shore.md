> The wealthiest district below the more well-to-do [[Summit Magnimar district|Summit]] region, **Silver Shore** is far more affluent than the rest of the rough and ready [[Shore Magnimar district|Shore]] region. Within the city district of [[Keystone]], it is mainly home to well off merchants, members of the [[Council of Ushers]] and several noble families who have decided to base themselves by the shore. The reasons why the wealthy choose life down by the shore are myriad: some want to stay close to their water based businesses; others want to stay close to the people themselves; while some just prefer the view. As well as for its residents, Silver Shore is renowned for the bizarre [[Aquaretum]] created by [[Gnome|gnome]] inventor [[Nireed Wadincoast]] to serve as something half way between a museum and an aquarium.
