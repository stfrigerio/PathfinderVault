> The **Sandpoint Theater** is one of the six largest buildings in the town of [[Sandpoint]], and is located at the intersection of Festival and Bishop Streets. Considered to be one of the most impressive venues in northern [[Varisia]], it regularly hosts both A-list celebrities as well as local talent of all kinds.



## Appearance

> The Sandpoint Theater is a massive playhouse; the front of the building, well marked by a rather large awning, is located on the side facing Festival Street. A well worn path makes its way from this grand entrance to the doorstop of *[[Cracktooth's Tavern|Cracktooths Tavern]]*.


## Services

> The Theater provides a number of opportunities for local actors, singers, and others to gain recognition of their skill; throughout the week local talents are given the opportunity to showcase their abilities. The primary draw, however, are three weekend shows for which the venue's owner, [[Cyrdak Drokkus]], uses his contacts in [[Magnimar]] to ensure the finest productions are always available.


## Notable Individuals


##### [[Cyrdak Drokkus]]

This flamboyant bard is the owner and sole financier of the Sandpoint Theater. Having had to flee Magnimar for reasons unknown, he takes great pride in competing directly with their playhouses on a regular basis.  Although he habitually flirts with any young woman who crosses his path, his romantic relationship with the paladin Sir Jasper Korvaski is one of Sandpoint's worst-kept secrets.  For some reason, he and the town's other prominent bard, [[Ameiko Kaijitsu]], don't get along.  The two of them rarely miss an opportunity to insult or slander each other, but neither has seen fit to explain the cause of their rivalry.
