> **Baza's Pool** is the westernmost of the sixteen city districts of [[Sothis]] lying in the 'upper' part of that city. To its north is the arty [[Street of Artisans]] district; to its east is the industrial [[Canal District]]; while to its south-east, across a wide canal, is the seedy [[Crimson Island]]. Baza's Pool is one of the wealthy, peripheral suburbs of the city and like other similar districts, it contains large oasis circles; wide, tree-lined streets; and excellent facilities for its inhabitants. These residents include wealthy merchants and craftsmen, civil servants and even nobles dwelling in their mansions.
