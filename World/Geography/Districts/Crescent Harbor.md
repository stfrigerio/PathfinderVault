> The island of **Crescent Harbor** is usually the first district of [[Port Peril]]—the *de facto* capital of the [[Shackles]]—that any visitor sees as all cargo has to dock in Crescent Harbor before entering the main part of the city. This process is attentively and efficiently governed by the harbour-master, [[Tsojmin Kreidoros]].
