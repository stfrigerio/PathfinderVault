> [[Old Kintargo|Old Kintargos]] **Old Harbour** is no longer the busiest dock in [[Kintargo]], losing out to [[Yolubilis Harbor]] and the Foreign Quarter of [[Jarvis End]]; the nearby [[Salt Gate]] now lies rusted open from neglect. Still, despite its decline, it is still used for much of the city's food, its raw materials and [[Salt|salt]], much of which ends up being traded at the nearby [[Salt Market]].
