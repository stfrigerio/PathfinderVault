> Found in the western part of the [[Keystone]] district, the area now known as the Burn was once home to the [[Varisian Council]]. When esteemed painter [[Goren Andosalu]] went mad and lit his studio on fire. The fire spread to several other fine buildings in the area, killing over 48 people. Andosalu was never confirmed as one of the dead. This destruction, so close to their home building, caused the Varisian Council to change where it convenes. Between this and the [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] of these 48 residents that are rumored to haunt the location, most locals avoid the area. A local group of cat burglars, named [[The Gargoyles]] uses the old Varisian Council building as a headquarters.
