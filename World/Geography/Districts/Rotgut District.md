> The **Rotgut District** of [[Riddleport]] is located just east of the [[Riddleport Harbor|Riddleport Harbors]] docks. This district of collapsing tenements is crammed up against the city's eastern ridge. It is the poorest district of the city and features the highest crime rate. It hosts many brothels and alehouses. Every crimelord seems to have business in the Rotgut District.
