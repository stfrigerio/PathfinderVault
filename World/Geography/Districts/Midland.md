 Midland is the district on the far side of the bridge, High Bridge, seen on the left of this picture of the city of Korvosa.
> The **Midland District** is what most visitors think of when they speak of [[Korvosa]]. Located in the southeast quadrant of the city, it is home to the majority of Korvosa's merchants, shops, and financial institutions. The criminal elements who might prey on this accumulation of wealth are kept in check by the fact that both the headquarters of the [[Korvosan Guard]] and the [[Sable Company]] are located here as well.
