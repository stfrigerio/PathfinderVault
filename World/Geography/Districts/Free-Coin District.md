> The **Free-Coin District** of [[Riddleport]] is located in the northwestern corner of the city, on the far banks of the [[Velashu River]]. It gets its name from the fact that [[Gaston Cromarcky|Overlord Cromarcky]] declared that all gambling halls in the district would operate tax-free. The reason for this, of course, is that the Overlord partially or wholly owns all these establishments. The three largest game-halls, the [[Dragon's Hoard|Dragons Hoard]], the [[Watercress]] and the [[House of Nabin]] have all greatly increased in popularity in recent years, even though it is widely known that the games of chance are rigged in favor of the house.
