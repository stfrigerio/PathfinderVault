> The **Sandpoint Town Hall** is a large, two-story building which can be found at the intersection of [[Roads of Sandpoint|Main Street and Tower Street]].
> The ground floor consists of the large town meeting hall, which hosts the infrequent and often poorly attended town meetings. It is designed to be able to accommodate all of Sandpoint's adult community, but in recent years meetings have been less than half full.
> The top floor is made up of storage rooms and offices for civic officials, the chief of which is that of [[Kendra Deverin|Mayor Kendra Deverin]].
> The basement holds Sandpoint's bank, which has been located there for decades. For almost as long, there has been talk of moving the bank to its own structure, but such decisions are generally sidetracked and abandoned due to various local concerns.
