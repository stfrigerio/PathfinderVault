*For another meaning of "coins", please see [[List of currencies]].*
> **The Coins** district in [[Absalom]] resides just north of the great city's docks, at the heart of the City at the Center of the World. This area is home to much of the trade, both legal and illegal, that occurs within Absalom. The transient nature of its primarily merchant population facilitates the illicit exchange of [[Recreational drugs of Golarion|drugs]] and other contraband.
> Despite its reputation, some areas of the district such as the [[Monger's Mart|Mongers Mart]] and the [[Grand Bazaar]] remain more respectable, and here the potential for profit outweighs the risk of unlawful dealings. Wherever money changes hands, however, tempers and greed can get the best of even the most civil, and the Coins reports more murders than any other district of Absalom save the [[Puddles]].



## Economy

> Commerce goes on in the district at all hours: taverns are open 24 hours a day, with magical and natural illumination keeping markets open through the night, and public [[Time Callers]] shout the hour, every hour, on the street.


## Government

> [[Myleena of House Arnsen]] is the [[Government of AbsalomDistrict councils|Nomarch]] of the [[Government of AbsalomDistrict councils|District Council]], which is known as the Coin Council. Until the recent abolition of [[Slavery|slavery]] within the city, [[Navvem of House Wachail|Lord Navvem of House Wachail]], another member of the Coin Council, held the position of Slave Overseer.


## District Guard

> The Coin's District Guard is colloquially known as the "[[Token Guard]]", and takes a lenient view on crime. The guard only responds to offenses when paid to do so by a private concern or to avoid the attention of the [[Government of AbsalomPrimarch|primarch]]. The Token Guard's most typical response to a disturbance is to arrest everyone at the scene and hold them for disturbing the peace at [[Bail House]] until someone can pay for their release.


## Places of interest

> Dozens of stores, taverns, halls, and other places of interest dot the district, but the following are perhaps the most well-known locations in the Coins:

> - [[District Guard|Bail House]]: Headquarters of the District Guard
> - [[Grand Bazaar]]: Vast, ever changing market where nearly everything can be bought and sold
> - [[Red Silk Route]]: Market where the desires of the flesh are satisfied
> - [[Saucy Wench]]: Enormous mead hall found at the center of the Grand Bazaar
