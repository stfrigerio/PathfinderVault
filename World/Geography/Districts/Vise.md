> **The Vise** is [[Vyre|Vyres]] bustling waterfront district and is most visitors' first introduction to the sin-loving City of Masks. The Vise gained its name from the belief that, as it is where most people first arrive, it is where Vyre grabs its visitors and never lets go. the Vise is split into two smaller neighbourhoods: [[Old Vyre]] and [[Southmarket]] and, between them, they contain much of the city's infrastructure. The Vise is also home to many of the city's hostels, each a mixture of tavern and inn, including [[Dancing Cat|the Dancing Cat]], [[Heavenly House|the Heavenly House]], and [[Seven Apples|the Seven Apples]]. These hostels are served by so-called "Reputation Watchers", locals who specialise in ensuring visitors to the city maintain the anonymity the City of Masks is renowned for.
