> Most of the other areas of the [[Summit Magnimar district|Summit]] region of [[Magnimar]] are residential but **Bridgeward**, within the [[Capital District]] of the city, is the exception: while most industry takes place in the [[Shore Magnimar district|Shore]], Bridgeward is home to the most refined crafts like jewelers, sculptors and other artisans. It is also home to one of Magnimar's most rare industries, the [[Golemworks]], which creates many types of [[Golem|golems]] for its incredibly rich customers. Bridgeward also contains the [[Cenotaph Magnimar|Cenotaph]] and the surrounding [[Mourner's Plaza|Mourners Plaza]] where Magnimar's social elite are buried in the shadow of the monument to the town's founder.
