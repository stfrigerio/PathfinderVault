 The ward of Bridgefront, in Old Korvosa.
> **Old Korvosa** is the oldest part of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]]. It covers all of [[Endrin Isle]], which rises from sea level in the estuary mouth of the [[Jeggare River]] to a 200-foot-high escarpment on the seaward north side. At the foot of [[Garrison Hill]], as this steep incline is called, sits the poverty-stricken, and collapsing ward of [[Bridgefront]]. Old Dock stands on the relatively flat eastern protrusion of the island. Atop Garrison Hill stands the stone wall of [[Fort Korvosa]], completed in [[4438 AR]]. The imposing black-marble [[Palace Arkona]] dominates Old Korvosa. The remains of the original wooden palisade slowly rot, like much of the rest of the ward, near the gate into the district.
