> The district of **Portside** is the hub of foreign trading in the [[Andoran|Andoren]] capital of [[Almas]]. Located in the south-easternmost part of the city, Portside is bordered by the [[Liberty District]] to the north, the [[East Hill]] neighborhood to the northeast, the city wall to the east, and the [[Andoshen River]] to the south and west. Most of the district is under the control of [[Demarchy Assembly]], who have begun to worry that a recent spate of business mergers might signal a hostile takeover attempt by the [[Cheliax|Chelish-backed]] [[Aspis Consortium]].
