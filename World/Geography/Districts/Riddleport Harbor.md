> The main **harbor of [[Riddleport]]** is somewhat crowded with piers and [[Ship|ships]]. Runoff from the city's sewage gutters and silt from the muddy [[Velashu River]] sometimes color the water a nasty brown, but ocean currents usually keep the harbor fresh and filled with [[Fish|fish]] that in turn draw predators such as [[Shark|sharks]], [[Bunyip|bunyips]], [[Devilfish|devilfishes]], and barracudas.
