> The **Great Salt Harbor** is the name given to [[Augustana|Augustanas]] outer harbor that faces [[Aspo Bay]] on the [[Inner Sea]]. It is separated from the brackish inner [[Fresh Harbor]] by two bridges that span the [[Fleet District]]: the [[Market Bridge]] and the [[Fleet Bridge]]. The Great Salt Harbor is the only part of the harbor accessible by tall, ocean-going vessels, as the bridges block all access to the Fresh Harbor. The Salt Harbor is bordered to its north by the [[Admiralty Hill District]] and the [[Arsenal District]], to the south by the [[Shipyard District Augustana|Shipyard District]], and on both sides by the Fleet District. [[Arsenal Island]], home of the Andoren navy, sits on the edge of the Great Salt Harbor, across from [[Fort Constance]]. The majority of Augustana's many shipyards and dry docks are located on the Great Salt Harbor.
