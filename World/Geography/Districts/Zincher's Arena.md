> The **Zincher's Arena** is located in the [[Wharf District]] of [[Riddleport]]. It is a massive stone structure that dominates the district. It holds brutal contests of strength and combat prowess between slaves, criminals, gladiators, and captured wild beasts and monsters. Sometimes the arena holds formal duels between members of Riddleport's elite. Crimelord [[Clegg Zincher]] runs the arena.
