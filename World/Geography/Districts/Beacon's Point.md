> **Beacon's Point** forms one side of [[Outcast's Cove|Outcasts Cove]], the harbour that forms the heart of [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] nautical trade. It is sometime called **The Shipyard** or the **Worker's District**, and contains Magnimar's poorest neighbourhood, [[Rag's End|Rags End]]. As may be expected of a district that deals with hardy sea folk it is loud and raucous. Beacon's Point is home of many hard working dock families as well as numerous sailors and other ocean goers, it also houses numerous warehouses, shipping concerns and other such businesses. The most famous landmark of Beacon's Point is its statue studded lighthouse, the [[Wyrmwatch]], which was supposedly built upon the very spot where [[Alcaydian Indros]] vanquished the [[Vydrarch]].
