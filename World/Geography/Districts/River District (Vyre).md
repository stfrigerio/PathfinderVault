> The **River District** is one of several neighborhoods that comprise the residential district of [[Pauper's Palace|Paupers Palace]] in the sin-soaked city of [[Vyre]]. River District provides some relief for the city's residents from the hustle, the bustle, and the sheer debauchery of [[Bliss]] and [[Vise|the Vise]]. The River District is the beating heart of Pauper's Palace and its most diverse district. It is also home to the park-turned-open-slum known as the [[Graveolent Gardens]], as well as the [[Darakole Sanitarium]] where those mentally ravaged by Vyre's debauchery often wash up. The River District is bisected by the [[Vyre River]]; it is bordered to the north by [[Sanctuary Vyre|Sanctuary]] and [[Sunshade]], to the east by [[Nightcrown]] and [[Southmarket]], to the west by [[Duskwalk]] and [[Westwatch]], and to the south by [[Graystone]].
