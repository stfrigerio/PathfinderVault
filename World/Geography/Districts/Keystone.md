*For another meaning of "Keystone", please see Keystone (palace).*
> [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] central district of **Keystone** flows south-west from the mysterious and beautiful [[Seerspring Gardens]] that sit almost exactly at the centre of the [[Shore Magnimar district|Shore]] region and the whole of modern Magnimar. Keystone is surrounded by other districts with the salt encrusted [[Dockway]] to the north east, artistic [[Lowcleft]] to the east, while the poorer [[Beacon's Point|Beacons Point]] stretches to the north. Central to the city of Magnimar, Keystone still manages to maintain its own unique feel and, thanks to Seerspring Gardens, is a surprisingly peaceful district.
