> **The War Cage** is a shop located in the [[Yolubilis Harbor]] district of [[Kintargo]] that is a favourite amongst the [[Adventurer|adventuring community]]. The War Cage is named for its arena-like structure with a central sparring area where customers can try out any of the [[Weapon|weapons]] for sale, including a *frost lucerne hammer* that, it is claimed, hails from distant [[Irrisen]]. The War Cage is run by [[Chuko|Chuko Sharp Beak and Hooks]] a [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]] ex-adventurer who gives a discount to other adventurers, but also possesses a well-known hatred of thieves.
