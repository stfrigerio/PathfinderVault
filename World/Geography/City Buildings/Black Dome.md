 The Black Dome from within.
> The **Black Dome** is a massive hemispherical structure that dominates the skyline of [[Osirion|Osirions]] capital, [[Sothis]]; indeed, it is the tallest building in the city. It is the remains of the carapace of a uniquely gargantuan [[Scarab beetle|scarab beetle]] that has been modified to house the royal palace, the [[Palace of the Forthbringer]], and the estates of many of the city's noble elite.


## History

> The shell long pre-dates the founding of Sothis. According to the lore of the cult of [[Nethys]], it belonged to [[Ulunat]], a [[Spawn of Rovagug|spawn of Rovagug]] who emerged from [[Pit of Gormuz]] in [[-3923 AR]]. After attacking the kingdom of [[Ninshabur]] in [[Casmaron]], Ulunat laid waste to northeastern [[Garund]], before being killed by [[Nethys]] shortly before he became a god. Ulunat's blood is said to have caused springs and oases to spontaneously form, and within a few years, local tribes started seeking shelter from seasonal [[Khamsin|khamsin]] storms under its shell. These gatherings eventually led to a permanent population settling here and young Sothis was born.
> As Sothis grew and became more socially stratified, the area under the Black Dome became the exclusive domain of the upper classes. Eventually only the pharaoh, his family, the non-royal nobility, and foreign embassies were allowed to live under its shelter.


## The Interior

> The interior of the shell is decorated with magical [[Faerie fire|faerie fire]] constellations. The Black Dome houses the Palace of the Forthbringer, the [[Council of the Sun and Sky]], the [[Sothis Exhibitory]], [[Menetnashte's Orrery|Menetnashtes Orrery]], and the Shepeskan Grove of [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid-tended]] saplings.
> Access to the public is strictly limited with only 100 people allowed into the interior per day.
