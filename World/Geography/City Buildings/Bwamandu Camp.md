> The **Bwamandu Camp** within the large town of [[Kibwe]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] is a tiny camp composed almost entirely of former [[Slave|slaves]] and prisoners who escaped [[Usaro]] with their friends and families. They have created a small encampment dedicated to mutual support and to plan plots against the [[Gorilla King]]'s followers.
> As of [[4719 AR]], the camp has struggled to integrate another wave of refugees from Usaro that escaped during the tumult following the Gorilla King's death in [[4710 AR]].
