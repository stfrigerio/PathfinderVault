 *Razor Jenni*, the *final blade* of Torvin Academy
> **Torvin Academy** is a university in the small city of [[Edme]] in [[Galt]]. The most famous dean of this formerly prestigious Academy was the [[Half-elf|half-elf]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Hosetter]], who was later executed by the *[[PathfinderWiki/Items/Artifacts/Minor Artifacts/Final blade|final blade]]* known as *[[Razor Jenni]]*. Torvin Academy has now been converted to serve as a political prison with *Razor Jenni* sitting in the middle of the Academy's once elegant quadrangle. The Academy has grey walls and its quadrangle is cobbled and full of trampled weeds. *Razor Jenni* stands on a wooden scaffold, with a stocks below to secure the condemned prisoners before the *final blade* strikes.
