> **Eel's End** is the name given to a pier on the eastern edge of [[Endrin Isle]], in [[Korvosa|Korvosas]] [[Old Korvosa]] district. Five [[Ship|ships]] are permanently anchored here, forming a [[Drug|drug]], prostitution, and gambling complex run by [[Devargo Barvasi]], also known as the King of Spiders.


## Description

> The dock known as Eel's End can be found on Wave Street, on the south-easternmost tip of the city district of Old Korvosa, just east of the last wooden bridge to connect Endrin Isle to the mainland district of [[North Point]]. The dock itself is decorated with lanterns shaped like [[Dream spider|dream spiders]] and god's eye, although they are only lit at night.
> At the end of the 70 foot quay, the visitor finds five permanently moored ships, each housing a different (largely illicit) businesses overseen by Barvasi. In a clockwise direction when approaching the end of the pier, these ships are: the *Twin Tigers*, a [[Ship|barge]] housing an often raucous gambling hall, the *Dragon's Breath Corridor*, a once-mighty vessel, now painted a gaudy shade of red that holds a silken drug den, the *Eel's End*, an old [[Ship|warship]] that serves as Barvasi's headquarters, the *House of Clouds*, a brothel run by a [[Half-elf|half-elven]] madam named Halvara, and the *Goldenhawk*, a single-masted [[Cheliax|Chelish]] ship, patched and repaired in hundreds of places, which acts as a floating inn. None of these vessels are seaworthy, and are kept in just good-enough repair to keep them from sinking into the [[Jeggare River]].
