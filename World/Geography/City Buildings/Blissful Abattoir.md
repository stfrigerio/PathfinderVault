> [[Vyre]] has no room for wasteful graves, **The Blissful Abattoir** instead suffices. Located in the [[Graystone]] neighbourhood of the [[Pauper's Palace|Paupers Palace]] district, the Blissful Abattoir is home of the [[Collectors of the Abattoir]] who gather the bodies of the local dead. Clad in orange and wearing the pointed beak-masks of [[Plague|plague]] doctors the Collectors of the Abattoir claim to be worshippers of an obscure [[Psychopomp|psychopomp]] [[Psychopomp usher|usher]] who provide cremation services to the city. In truth, they are worshippers of [[Norgorber]] in his aspect as the Gray Master and, instead of more obviously valuable trinkets, the Collectors of the Abattoir steal the bodies they collect for grim purposes including reanimation as [[Undead|undead]]. Lead by the devout [[Cleric|cleric]] of Norgorber, [[Quentin Crabb]], the Collectors have succeeded for generations in fooling everyone with their ruse, include investigators from the Church of [[Pharasma]].
