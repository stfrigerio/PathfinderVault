*For another meaning of "Grand Bazaar", please see [[Great Bazaar City of Brass]].*
> Nearly anything can be found for sale in the **Grand Bazaar** in [[The Coins]] district of [[Absalom]]. The area has few permanent buildings, and most goods are sold from tents, carts, portable stages, and merchant wagons. Many merchants use dancers or illusionists to draw a sufficient crowd to make a sale. Within the bazaar, hedonistic services are available at the [[Red Silk Route]] (well protected by the [[CoinsDistrict Guard|Token Guards]]), and the [[Saucy Wench]] mead hall is one of the few permanent buildings in the area. After dark, the Grand Bazaar becomes quite dangerous as criminals from the [[The Docks|Docks]] and the [[Puddles]] come here in search of heavy purses.
