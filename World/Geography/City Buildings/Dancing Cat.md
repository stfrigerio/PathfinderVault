> **The Dancing Cat** is one of the many hostels located across the [[Southmarket]] neighborhood of the sin-drenched city of [[Vyre]]. The Dancing Cat is marked by a sign of a [[Cat|cat]] leaping atop a bed of hot coals and is renowned across [[Vise|the Vise]] for protecting the privacy of its clientele. Perversely, the Dancing Cat is owned by [[Inaminah Clov]], a devotee of [[Norgorber]] who worships his aspect as the Reaper of Reputations and is a faith shared by most of her staff. Many in Vyre know of Clov's dedication to Norgorber but mistakenly believe this to be the city's primary temple to the fell god, completely unaware of how thoroughly Norgorber's worshippers have insinuated themselves into every facet of Vyre's society.
