> **Billivin's Benevolent Balms and Effulgent Elixirs** is a curious shop run by the eccentric [[Billiver Billivin]], and is located in the southwest of the [[Ordellia]] district in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]]. A magic shop of sorts, Billivin's is overflowing with every sort of [[Potion|potion]], elixir, [[Scroll|scroll]], alchemical supply, ingredient, book, papyrus, piece of sculpture, spell component, and other bric-a-brac imaginable, due to the fact that its [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Gnome|gnomish]] owner is a compulsive collector (some would say hoarder) whose organizational skills leave something to be desired.
