> The **Hornet's Nest tavern** is widely understood to be the best tavern in [[Tregan]] and the surrounding area of the [[Taldor]] / [[Galt]] border region, despite Tregan having a dozen inns and taverns as competition. The Hornet's Nest provides excellent food, wine and music and very comfortable rooms for its guests. There are stabling facilities for guests' steeds, with the stables located just next door to the inn. The tavern is owned by the [[Bard's End|bard]] called [[Vallyn]], an old adventuring companion of [[Elyana Sadrastis]]; he painted the tavern sign which hangs outside the main door: a gold hornet's hive.
