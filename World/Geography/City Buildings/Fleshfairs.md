> The **Fleshfairs** of [[Katapesh]] were opened in [[4363 AR]] in [[Okeno]]. It is the largest [[Slavery|slave]] market in the area, and possibly the world. The Fleshfairs draw buyers and sellers from all over, looking for expendable servants, shock troops, or manual laborers.
> The most common slaves found here are [[Human|humans]], making up half of the total slave population. [[Halfling|Halflings]] are especially popular, however, and raise a high price from customers. [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] and [[Elf|elves]] are rare, as dwarves are notoriously stubborn and rebellious, while elves are considered too frail.
