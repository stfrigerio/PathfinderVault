> **Wilderness Wares** is a merchant shop in the hamlet of [[Fort Thorn]]. It was established by a group of merchants wishing for a trade route to be created through the [[Bloodsworn Vale]]. 
> The shop is run by [[Bellar Graysalk]] who wishes someday to move to [[Korvosa]]. Bellar sells mostly common items under 100 gp, but has been known to acquire items from his consortium of around 10,000 gp in value with a 5-percent up charge. [[Gyrad Tolgrith]] and his solders of the fort have a limited line of credit with the Wares.
