> The **Murmur Dome of Prada Hanam** is a mysterious structure that appeared overnight in the small [[Jalmeray|Jalmeri]] fishing village of [[Prada Hanam]] in [[2821 AR]].


## Description

> The Murmur Dome is an imposing structure that contains a large, central domed building surrounded by four towers that rise to double the height of the inner one. The domed building contains only a large central room with tiled floors, while each of the towers houses a single staircase that rises to a single room. Each of the four rooms is empty except for a single window that faces east, some say toward distant [[Vudra]].


## History

> Before the appearance of the building, Prada Hanam was an otherwise unremarkable fishing village on the edge of the [[Obari Ocean]]. Because of the presence of the strange Murmur Dome, the village grew into a small city over the next few centuries. No one has been able to fully explain the origin or purpose of the Murmur Dome, although some [[Adventurer|adventurers]] have claimed that there is a spiral labyrinth located beneath the building. Anyone who claims this has soon died from a bizarre [[Diseases of Golarion|disease]] or [[Curse|curse]] that causes their flesh to turn to stone and their bones to [[Iron|iron]].
