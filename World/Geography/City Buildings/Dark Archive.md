> The **Dark Archive** is a location in the deepest vaults of the [[Pathfinder Society]] [[Grand Lodge|headquarters]] in [[Absalom]]. 
> First proposed by [[Zarta Dralneen]], it was designed to be a place where particularly dangerous [[World/Items & Equipment/Artifacts/Artifact|artifacts]] and relics could be safely stored and properly studied.
> Zarta is currently in charge of the Dark Archive and she utilizes her [[Dark Archive faction|faction]] to assist her in her activities. Though she has proven diligent in her duties, she also hopes to use the resources within the archives to her own benefit and to provide a backdoor route to power for her own Pathfinder followers.
