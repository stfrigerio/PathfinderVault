> **Bard's End** is the city of [[Korvosa|Korvosas]] largest inn, sitting in [[South Shore]] district where it provides welcome respite to weary travellers. Bard's End lies a block south of the [[Kendall Amphitheater]] and as such normally plays host to a variety of [[Music|musicians]] and performers—both famous and non-famous. A small stage dominates the common room of Bard's End and there is a performance there every night. For many [[Bard's End|bards]] and performers leaving [[Varisia]] (via Korvosa), their final performance will be for a handful of extra [[Coin|coins]] in the Bard's End common room.
