> **Bunyip Dock** is one of the many piers which jut into [[Lake Sorrow]] in the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] capitol of [[Egorian]]. It gets its name from the numerous [[Bunyip|bunyips]] known to prowl the water nearby, and is a destination for less-than-choosy paramours, and the occasional criminal needing to dispose of a body in its churning waters. It also serves as a regular dock for the loading and unloading of [[Ship|ships]] and their cargo during the day.
