> The impressive palace of **Bandeshar** is located in the [[Nex|Nexian]] capital of [[Quantium]]. It is situated in the middle of the city's lake.
> It was once the palace of the archmage [[Nex (person)|Nex]], and today is the meeting place of the ruling [[Council of Three and Nine]]. The palace is an architectural marvel, and was designed by Elder Architect [[Oblosk]], an ancient [[Pech|pech]] who still lives and holds the title Castellan of Bandeshar. He is believed to know most of the palace's architectural secrets. Its lower dungeons contain an entrance to the [[Refuge of Nex]], believed to be the location of the long-vanished archmage. The Bandeshar is also said to hold three of the remaining [[World/Items & Equipment/Wondrous Items/Cube of force|cubes of force]] created by Nex himself: those associated with the schools of [[Magic/Evocation|evocation]], [[Necromancy|necromancy]], and [[Transmutation|transmutation]].
