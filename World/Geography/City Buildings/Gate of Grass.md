> The **Gate of Grass** is the easternmost gate of the [[Karazh]] capital [[Ular Kel]]. The bustling tent markets of [[Sunrise Triangle]] sit very near to the gate itself. From the Gate of Grass a single trade route connects across the rolling steppes of the [[Grass Sea]] to the mysterious, distant (and deeply xenophobic) [[Kaladay]].
