> The Bridge of the Gods is a true marvel of [[Engineering|engineering]]. Running over a mile in a gentle arc over the [[Hellfallen Cliffs]] at a height of 500 feet, the bridge connects [[Cloudreaver Keep]] with three spires of [[Alkenstar City]] at its apex and continues to the far side of the canyon where it ends at [[Dongun Hold]].
> Devotees of [[Sarenrae]] and other deities begin construction on the Bridge of the Gods in [[4619 AR]]. In [[4623 AR]], the construction of the Bridge is prematurely abandoned but at least connects Alkenstar City to Dongun Hold.
