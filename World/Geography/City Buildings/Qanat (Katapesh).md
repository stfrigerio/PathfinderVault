> The **qanat** in [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]] dates back to near the end of the [[Age of Enthronement]]. It was eventually abandoned after major complications, including the collapse of a major cistern. Tunnels were discovered underneath the cistern, but when exploration parties failed to return, the entrance was sealed before the qanat was abandoned.
> Several tunnels of this [[Qanat|qanat]] were purposefully collapsed due to an infestation of homeless and vermin.


## Structure

> The qanat has three different types of tunnels:

> - service - primary tunnels meant for workers to traverse. These tunnels are 15 feet wide with 5-foot wide ledges along either side. These ledges flank a 5-foot wide and 4-foot deep channel. The ceilings are arches 12 feet above the bottom of the channel.
> - distribution - supply tunnels taking water to wells underneath various city locations. These tunnels are 10 feet wide with arched ceilings 8 feet high.
> - supplementary - tunnels added for efficiency after the initial construction. These tunnels are only 3 feet wide and 3 feet tall.
> Tunnels generally meet in rooms measuring 30 feet square. Many of the intersections, as well as other locations, have shafts leading up to the city, but most have been collapsed over the years. At least one shaft was outfitted with a hoist to move creatures and equipment into and out of the qanat.
