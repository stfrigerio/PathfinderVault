> The ***Fatman's Feedbag*** is one of the most noisome and troubling taverns in the town of [[Sandpoint]]. Located along the community's southern docks, the *Feedbag* is known for regular brawls and the resulting visits by the town's sheriff, [[Belor Hemlock]].



## Services

> The *Feedbag* is a favorite watering hole for numerous [[Varisian|Varisians]] and sailors that are offered a less than stellar welcome at similar establishments in Sandpoint. It's also a common stomping grounds for individuals working in the employ of the local [[Sczarni]].


## Notable Individuals

> Known for playing host to a less than desirable client√®le, many citizens of Sandpoint avoid the *Feedbag* and its patrons. Exceptions to this common wisdom include [[Jubrayl Vhiski]], one of the establishment's few regulars, and the town's sheriff, though the latter often responds to quell the fights that commonly plague the location rather than partake in its offerings.


##### [[Gressel Tenniwar]]

This large man is the operator of the *Fatman's Feedbag*, and can often be found running the establishment.
