> **Fallen from Grace** is a seedy tavern in the small port town of [[Blackblood Cay]] on [[Shark Island]] in the [[Shackles]]. The [[Kellid]] woman, [[Arkel Kruggut]], who works as a bartender in the tavern, is a notable person. She is an utterly humorless person with a wicked scar that runs along her brow. She never speaks about her homeland but foreign Kellid warriors visit Arkel every few months. The warriors wear cloaks marked with a blood-red symbol of a three-fingered hand-print.
