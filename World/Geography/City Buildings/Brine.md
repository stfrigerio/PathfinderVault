> **The Brine** is an imposing stone prison house located in the [[Puddles]] district in [[Absalom]]. Lady Seichya of [[House Tevineg]] serves as the prison's head warden.
> Ever since the regular flooding of the district, The Brine has ensured a slow but certain death for the criminals within. The holding pens is usually soaked with at least a foot of water from the flooding, but also raw sewage washes in from time to time, typically resulting in outbreaks of filth fever and general sickness.
> Although the guards use elevated catwalks to stay out of the muck, the prisoners below frequently are forced to stand, sit and sleep in the foul waters.
> Especially important individuals are sent to [[Black Whale]] prison.
> The [[Salt Cartel]] fills its stocks of [[Slavery|slaves]] from prisoners fraudulently collected from the Brine.
