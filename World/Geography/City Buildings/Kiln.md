> **The Kiln** is the headquarters of the [[Ardoc family]], part fortress and part factory, located in the [[Bis]] district of [[Kaer Maga]]. Important trials and policy discussions happen in the **Judgment Seat**, a great hall on the top floor. The Kiln is large enough to house the entire family, if needed in times of trouble. Most of the building contains workshops for the Ardocs to produce their [[Construct|constructs]] and conduct [[Magic|magical]] research.
