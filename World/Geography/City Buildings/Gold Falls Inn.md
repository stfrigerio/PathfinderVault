> The **Gold Falls Inn** hangs out over the roaring [[Gold Falls]] of [[Foam River]] in the area of [[Darkmoon Vale]] in [[Andoran]]. The inn offers a spectacular views of the waterfall. It is a large well-guarded lodge made by stone and timber, standing on the northern shore of the river, right next to the falls. The inn serves as a popular waypoint on the trail from [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] west to [[Cheliax]]. [[Mierson Berekland]], a friendly middle-aged retired [[Pathfinder]], is the owner of the inn. The Berekland family still operates the sluice above the falls.


## History

> The inn is originated as a small [[Dwarf|dwarven]] fortress built to control a wide bridge across the river at the top of the falls. The bridge was collapsed in one of the massive earthquakes during the [[Rending]] and the fort was abandoned and fell into ruin. In [[4437 AR]] an explorer named [[Argus Berekland]] discovered placer gold at the base of the falls. Argus and his small group of friends cleared the ruins and built a sluice above the falls among the ruins of the great bridge. Over time, the group built a heavily defended manor house to guard the sluice and offer protection to travelers along the riverside trail.
