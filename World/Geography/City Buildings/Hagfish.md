> ***The Hagfish*** is built on the western-most dock at the southern end of [[Sandpoint]], along Water Street. It is one of the most popular taverns in the community, especially among fishermen and gamblers. The owner is a one-legged human named [[Jargie Quinn]].



## Appearance

> *The Hagfish* is a wooden building built on a series of piers over the Sandpoint Harbor. Within the tavern, a large glass aquarium sits behind the bar and holds Norah, the hagfish for which tavern earns its name. Due to the nature of the hagfish, and the lack of cleaning Jargie purposefully maintains within the tank, the aquarium is thick with extremely slimy and foul-tasting water. A large leather pouch bulging with coins hangs from a nail next to the tank, and the ceiling beams above bear a number of names carved into them.


## Services

> *The Hagfish* is known for the best seafood dinners in Sandpoint, and the establishment also boasts a number of well-maintained gaming tables with a wide variety of games. In addition, patrons are welcome pay coin to attempt to drink a mug of water from Nora's tank; those that do so successfully are allowed to carve their name into the ceiling beam above the tank and claim a bag of coins filled with the fees paid by those unsuccessful in the attempt. The location is also a favorite stomping grounds for those wishing to partake in the game of "yarning". Quinn also defies superstition and grants a prize to any customer who completes, at volume, the whole song that mocks the [[Sandpoint Devil]].
