> **Andos Hall** is the former city hall of [[Kintargo]]; sat within the [[Castle District]], it is thoroughly dwarfed by the neighbouring [[Castle Kintargo]] next to which it appears understated and quaint. Only three storeys tall, the top floor was once dedicated to the Lord Mayor and his offices, whilst the lower storeys housed the bureaucratic web that supported city civic life. With the arrival of the new Lord Mayor, [[Barzillai Thrune]], Andos Hall has been boarded up; now, the mayor splits his time between Castle Kintargo and the [[Kintargo Opera House]].
