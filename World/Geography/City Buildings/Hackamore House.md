> **Hackamore House** is the leading carriage, harness, and tack store in [[Absalom]], located in the [[Coins]] district. The business is run by the [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaur]] Aetris Thunderhoof and her lover Glenair of House Jefreet, a druid born in [[Diobel]]. After taking over a failing cul-de-sac of shops, Aetris converted the formerly open-air market into a series of stalls for all manner of steeds.  Nearly any kind of steed, tack, or vehicle is in stock or can be ordered; even centaurs can be shod here, although they must be muzzled.
