> **Bail House** is the headquarters of the [[CoinsDistrict Guard|Token Guard]], the district guard of the [[Coins]] district of [[Absalom]]. It gets its name from the guard's habit of jailing everyone present at a disturbance and holding them until they can post bail (which is usually 1 cp per arrest). The edifice is a squat building of wood and mortar with barred windows and two gated entrances, designed primarily to survive a riot.
