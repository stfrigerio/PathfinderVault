> **Delvehaven** is the name of the [[Pathfinder lodge]] in the old [[Cheliax|Chelish]] capital of [[Westcrown]]. It was founded in the late 47th century AR by [[Venture-Captain]] [[Aiger Ghaelfin]].


## History

> Ghaelfin sealed the lodge in the weeks immediately following the death of [[Aroden]] in [[4606 AR]], fearing that the rioting would spread to the lodge and endanger its precious collection. Prior to closing down, it was one of the most significant lodges in the [[Inner Sea]] region, serving not just as a lodge but also (in Chelish fashion) as a museum.
> Closed for 30 years, it was eventually reopened in [[4674 AR]] after repeated petitioning by the [[Pathfinder Society]]. [[House Thrune]] allowed this request, but with a significant limitation: the House would choose which [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] could take residence in the lodge. The Society reluctantly agreed, and the next two years were to prove greatly disappointing to it: the propped-up Thrunists in the lodge provided reports of many missing artifacts ("disappeared during the rioting of [[4606 AR]]"), and the quality of their Pathfinder material was shoddy and unusable.
> The situation soon righted itself in [[4676 AR]]. Rumors of a terrible tragedy in Delvehaven began to circulate throughout the [[Inner Sea region]], and the Chelish government tacitly confirmed these rumors by closing the lodge entirely, sealing and warding the entrances with magical locks and wards of great power.
> Since then the lodge has stood silent and shut, rumored to be haunted, and occupying a sore spot in the minds of Society historians.
