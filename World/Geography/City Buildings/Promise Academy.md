## Glorious Endeavour

Mengkare, as the founder of the utopian society on [[Hermea]], is deeply interested in the development and growth of the human race. One of his long-standing dreams has been the establishment of an institution of learning that would allow for the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. His vision was a center of education that would nourish the intellect, the spirit, and the personal growth of its students. This led him to the foundation of Promise Academy.

The Promise Academy was envisioned by Mengkare as the ultimate center of learning on Golarion, a beacon of knowledge to rival even the most prestigious schools of magic. He employed the best builders to construct the academy, and under the guise of his human avatar, Lamond Breachton, he recruited the brightest scholars and academics from across the world to teach there.

The Academy was created as a manifestation of the principles of Mengkare's Glorious Endeavor. It is not only a center of learning but also a testing ground for the principles that govern Hermea. Mengkare believes that through a combination of excellent education and a controlled environment, he can raise a new generation of humans that will one day fulfill their maximum potential and aid in achieving the utopia he envisions.

To maintain his connection with the Academy, Mengkare often visits Promise Academy under the guise of Lamond Breachton. During his visits, he assesses the progress of the Academy, interacts with the students and faculty, and imparts his wisdom and guidance when necessary. Despite his formidable power and influence, he subtly guides the direction of the Academy, allowing the faculty and students to shape their own destinies within the parameters of his grand design.

Finally, Promise Academy is also one of the ways Mengkare attracts bright minds to Hermea. The Academy's reputation for academic excellence draws promising individuals from across Golarion, providing Mengkare with a pool of potential candidates to invite to Hermea to join his Glorious Endeavor.
