> **Quickfall Abbey**, a ruined former temple to [[Aroden]], is located in the center of the [[Abbey Green]] district of [[Cassomir]]. The abbey was once the center of Cassomir.
> Locals report hearing moans and screams from the site, fueling rumours the abbey is haunted and adding credence to stories putting the abbey at the center of several disappearances. As a result, Abbey Green locals tend to avoid the abbey's grounds despite the otherwise jovial nature of the district's residents.
