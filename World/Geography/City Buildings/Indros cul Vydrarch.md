> The **Indros cul Vydrarch** is a tall marble sculpture that commemorates [[Alcaydian Indros]]' defeat of the famous [[Vydrarch]] in the place that would eventually become [[Magnimar]]. The monument sits in the middle of [[Indros cul Vydrarch Plaza]], a busy square opposite the [[Usher's Hall|Ushers Hall]], the seat of Magnimar's government, in the [[Capital District]] of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city.
> Local legend has it that reciting the poem *Upon a Serpent's Grave* in [[Aquan]] while admiring the statue gives the performer extra skill at arms against sea creatures.
