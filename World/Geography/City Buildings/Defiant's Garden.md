> **Defiant's Garden** is the name given to the mayoral residence of the city of [[Magnimar]], located in the [[Vista]] district directly next to the [[Seacleft]] itself, it is the largest and most impressive home in all the city. Defiant's Garden only became the official mayor's residence with the rise of the current, decadent Lord-Mayor [[Haldmeer Grobaras]], before Grobaras the mayor's residence was a humbler place within the city that kept him in touch with the people. Haldmeer Grobaras however wanted nothing so humble and took Defiant's Garden, which had previously been used as a palace for visiting dignitaries, as his personal home. The building itself is huge, being closer to a small castle than a manor, it is eight stories tall and filled with room after room of salons and lounges all devoted to the mayor's pleasure.
