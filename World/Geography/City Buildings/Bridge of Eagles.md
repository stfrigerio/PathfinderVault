> The **Bridge of Eagles** in [[Citadel Vraid]] spans the wide chasm between the [[Bastion Tyrannous]] and [[Bastion Ferox]]. Bastion Tyrannous is the central castle of Citadel Vraid's three castles while Bastion Ferox is the easternmost, the smallest, and most isolated. The bridge was named for Paralictor Kaan's vicious execution of [[Tungar Oxslayer]], jothka of the now-extinct Lamokra tribe of the [[Shoanti]] [[Sklar-Quah]] and leader of the Ten-Tribe's Rebellion.
