> The [[Cheliax|Chelish]] embassy in [[Absalom]] is housed in the former temple of [[Aroden]], which was leased by the [[Grand Council]] after the god's death. Located in the city's [[Ascendant Court]] district, the building was once connected to the pillar of the [[Starstone Cathedral]] by a bridge, which was destroyed by an earthquake in [[4698 AR]]. This disaster bankrupted the aged priests who still tended the temple, and Cheliax was eventually permitted to purchase the damaged building. The building itself is considered one of the crown jewels of religious architecture of the [[Inner Sea region]], and is the oldest temple to the Last Azlanti in the Ascendant Court.
