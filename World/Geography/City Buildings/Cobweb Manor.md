> **Cobweb Manor** sits adjacent to the [[Opal Market]] of [[Nightcrown]] in the city of [[Vyre]]. The manor belongs to [[Manticce Kaleekii]] who controls the Opal Market and, unbeknown to most, is one of the [[Kings and Queens of Vyre|Queens of Vyre]], the Queen of Delights. Cobweb Manor is an ancient and decrepit looking estate that gained its name thanks to the fist sized grey [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spiders]] that roam its halls and, rumour has it, whisper all sorts of secrets to Manticce. The bones of Manticce's deceased husband also remain sitting at the table in the manor's dining hall adding further macabre decorations to Cobweb Manor.
