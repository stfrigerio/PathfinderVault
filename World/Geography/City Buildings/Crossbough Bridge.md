> **Crossbough Bridge** is a covered structure straddling the [[Millrun River]] near the point where it meets its tributary, the [[Bainecreek]]. Today no water flows beneath the bridge after the [[War Without Rivals]], waged in the surrounding area, left the wasteland known today as [[The Furrows|the Furrows]]. Such is the cruel nature of the land now, that no one trying to cross the bridge survives to reach the other side. Perhaps this phenomenon is linked to the brutal death during the war of a Coronel Jebaid; the evil man was captured then drowned at this spot.
