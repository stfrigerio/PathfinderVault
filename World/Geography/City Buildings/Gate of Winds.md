> The **Gate of Winds** is the northernmost city gate of the [[Karazh]] capital [[Ular Kel]]. Just north of the Gate of Winds, amidst the rolling steppes of the [[Grass Sea]], lies the [[Trade Palace]], a strange roofless castle that serves as a temporary home for any of the Kara horse tribes that are visiting the city to trade. From the Gate of Winds, a road winds north across the vast Grass Sea to the distant shores and port cities of the [[Castrovin Sea]].
