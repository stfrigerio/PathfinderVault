> **The Beast** is the largest crane in the world. It is located at edge of the Long Pier, near the center of the [[The Docks|Docks]] district of [[Absalom]]. The Beast is used to unload the heaviest and largest loads in Absalom. It is a five-story stone windmill-like massive structure, with a long wooden winch-and-rope system sticking out of the top. The entire building can rotate on its axis and its main arm can extend out from its normal 25-foot length. Built 500 years ago, it is well maintained, capable of lifting nearly 60 tons to a height of 55 feet. When lifting loads no more than 10 tons, it can swing them in a 360-degree arc anywhere within 100 feet of its central tower. Its structure contains 16 [[Human|human]]-operated treadwheels. All the warehouses built around the Beast are multi-storey buildings with central shafts to allow the Beast's cables to raise and lower cargo to any of their floors.
> Responsible for the operation of the Beast is the [[Goodman Hugen|First Harbormaster]]. Running the Beast requires [[Engineering|engineering]] expertise, thus the crane is hired out to a professional crane master. Recently, [[Adrielle Neprathep|Adrielle Neprathep of House Fyrlenn]] was replaced by [[Amaziah Meneha]] as the chief engineer of the Beast.
> In [[4499 AR]], during the Red Siege, the Beast defended itself, using a one-ton block of stone as an oversized [[Flail|flail]].
