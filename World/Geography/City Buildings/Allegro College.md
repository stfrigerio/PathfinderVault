> **Allegro College** is an abandoned [[Bard's End|bardic]] college north of [[Absalom|Absaloms]] city walls, hidden behind the [[Frothripper]] waterfall.


## History

> The college was founded by [[Music|musicians]] and songwriters from Absalom seeking a secret, soundproof location where they could work without worrying about rivals stealing their creations. It was active for 7 years until the founders fell out of favor with each other in a violent disagreement over the purported existence of a hidden note.
> Some associated the note with the "Final March", a song to supposedly play at the end of the world. Others associated it with the [[Deity|deity]] [[Groetus]], and the college's conductor even bargained with the [[Heresy devil|heresy devil]] Nehemalis for its secrets. The depravity reached such a point that a former [[Paladin|paladin]] attending the college plotted a rebellion that ended in several members being dashed upon the rocks below Frothripper. 
> The remaining students split up, each taking parts of their masterpiece with them. It has sat unused for decades since.
