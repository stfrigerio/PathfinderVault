> **Clamor** is the nickname of a smithy in the town of [[Trunau]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. Its original name is **Morninghawk's Fine Steel** but is better known as Clamor because of the constant pounding of hammers that is heard from it. Councilor [[Sara Morninghawk]] is the owner of Clamor and oversees all of the metalwork for the town. She is the daughter of a [[Shoanti]] woman who arrived in Trunau already pregnant and didn't like talking about her past. Sara is married to the [[Dwarf|dwarf]] [[Agrit Staginsdar]].
