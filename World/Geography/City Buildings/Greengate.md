> The **Greengate** is [[Kintargo|Kintargos]] easternmost gate, located in [[The Greens]] district; it serves as the main overland link with the rest of [[Cheliax]] and, as such, it normally remains closed. The Greengate is mostly used by visiting Chelish dignitaries and nobles but sees little actual trade, unlike the busier [[Nightways Gate]] to the north.
