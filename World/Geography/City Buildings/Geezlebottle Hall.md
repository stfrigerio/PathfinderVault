> **Geezlebottle Hall** is a building at the [[Theumanexus College]] in [[Korvosa]].
> A curiously constructed building, Geezlebottle Hall is half built in the scale ideal for [[Halflings|halflings]] and [[Gnomes|gnomes]]. The other half is of the scale more comfortable for [[Humans|humans]] and other similar sized races. Its architecture was due to an oversight not foreseen until midway through its construction.
> The Hall itself resembles a large tree stump, out of which a grow a number of strangely shaped mushrooms of great size. The rambling walls had been shingled with dark wood. Oddly shaped turrets rise here and there from the roof.
> The building is named after the gnome mage, [[Tepest Geezlebottle]], a founding member of the college.
