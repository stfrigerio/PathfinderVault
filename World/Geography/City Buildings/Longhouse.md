> The **Longhouse** is the main meeting house of the town of [[Trunau]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. It hosts the council meetings but if the weather is bad it also holds the training sessions and celebrations normally held in the [[Commons Trunau|Commons]]. The structure also contains barracks for the young warriors under training by [[Jagrin Grath]]. Vast amounts of dry food, siege weapons and [[Potion|potions]] are stored in the Longhouse's extensive basement. Only the six councilors have keys for the basement.
