> The **Bazaar of Sails** is the largest free market in the whole of [[Varisia]]. Located in [[Dockway]], in the [[Shore Magnimar district|Shore]] region of [[Magnimar]], the Bazaar of Sails is adjacent to the waterfront, wedged between the [[Seacleft]] and the [[Varisian Gulf]] and is nearly under the [[Shadow Magnimar district|Shadow]] of the [[Irespan]]. The Bazaar of Sails is probably the busiest district of the city; it is filled with the hustle and bustle of traders from dozens of nations all competing for space, attention and profit. From [[Osirion|Osirian]] spices to [[Andoran|Andoren]] wood to [[Cheliax|Chelish]] clothing, the markets are filled with goods of every sort. With such a variety of wealth on display one might imagine the district to be riddled with crime, but it is well policed, though not by the [[Magnimar city watch]]. [[Sabriyya Kalmeralm]] bears the title "Princess of the Market", which she inherited from her missing father [[Nazir Kalmeralm]]; with the title comes the responsibility for keeping the markets reasonably safe through whatever means necessary. Some critics view Sabriyya as little more than Magnimar's most open crime boss, but those who trade in the Bazaar of Sails understand the service she provides even if it sometime requires unsavoury methods.
