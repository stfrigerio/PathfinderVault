> The **Crimson Throne** is the throne of the ruler of [[Korvosa]].  The throne, and thus the monarchy itself, is said to be cursed, and each ruling king or queen of Korvosa has died without a direct heir as a result. Queen [[Domina]] is the only parent to sit upon the throne, and she brought her adult son to Korvosa from [[Cheliax]].
> Additionally, no monarch has yet died of natural causes. Every ruler has perished at the hands of another, either through subtle or overt methods.
