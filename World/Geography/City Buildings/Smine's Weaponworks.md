> A blacksmith's shop, **Smine's Weaponworks**, secretly holds the [[Pathfinder lodge]] of the [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] city of [[Tymon]]. This secret lodge is run by the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[Venture-Captain]] [[Holgarin Smine]].
> Smine's Weaponworks is located near the [[Arena of Aroden]] and forges masterwork [[Weapon|weapons]] for which an insatiable demand has arisen as a result of Smine's fame. Wielding one of Smine's weapons is considered a must for a serious gladiator. The dwarf has three apprentices working with him.
