> The **Gas Forges** are located in the [[Wharf District]] of [[Riddleport]]. They are an extremely large structure of brick and [[Iron|iron]] with dozens of chimneys. The structure is populated by [[Dwarf|dwarven]] laborers who put on crude breathing masks as they work. Riddleport sits above a large deposit of [[Carbauxine|carbauxine]], a rare gas normally found deep in the [[Darklands]]. Carbauxine is a [[Poison|poisonous]], heavier-than-air gas that is difficult to work with, but carbauxine forges are immensely
valuable in metal-crafting. The Gas Forges are the only forges in [[Varisia]] capable of smelting [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]] and other high-hardness metals.
> The forges are owned by an anonymous consortium of dwarves that live in [[Janderhoff]]. They trust the daily running of the Gas Forges to [[Tromard Roldheim]].
