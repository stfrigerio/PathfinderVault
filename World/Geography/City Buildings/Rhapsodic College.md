> Located in [[Westport]], the **Rhapsodic College** is the smallest of the two bardic colleges in [[Oppara]], but produces the best trained [[Bard's End|bards]]. It is comprised of a few small buildings around a performance and practice hall. The courts of [[Cheliax]], [[Osirion]], [[Katapesh]], and many countries beyond the [[Inner Sea region]] employ graduates of Rhapsodic College as their primary [[Music|musicians]] and storytellers.


> The Rhapsodic College is the setting for much of the early chapters of *[[The Dagger of Trust]]*.
