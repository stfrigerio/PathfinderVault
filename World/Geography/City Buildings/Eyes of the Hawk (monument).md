**Eyes of the Hawk** is a monument in the [[Dockway]] district of [[Magnimar]]. It depicts the [[Eyes of the Hawk]] adventuring party and its twin [[Wizard|wizards]] [[Cailyn Vanderale|Cailyn]] and [[Romre Vanderale]] defeating the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spider-like]] [[Shriezyx|shriezyx]] in [[4623 AR]]. Local lore suggests mediating here grants a mystical advantage when injuring [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aberration|aberrant]] creatures.
