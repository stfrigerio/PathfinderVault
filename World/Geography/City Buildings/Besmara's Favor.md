> **Besmara's Favor** is a two-story inn in the small port of [[Bogsbridge]] in the [[Motaku Isle]] in the [[Shackles]]. It was built by the founder of the town, [[Falgood Boles]]. Since Boles discovered the unique breed of snail in the surrounding marshes that produced a rare purple dye, the town has grown. The town still continues to harvest the lucrative snails and the inn thrives. It is currently tended by Bole's cheerful granddaughter [[Tendry Boles]] who is also the mayor of the town.
