*For another meaning of "Commons", please see Commons (Varnhold).*
> The **Commons** is a wide amphitheater in the small town of [[Trunau]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. It is located at the center of the upper part of the town, serving as Trunau's training ground by day but also a place of relaxation and celebration by night. By day the residents engage in martial training under [[Jagrin Grath]], depending on their primary role in town. Every citizen is expected to train one day per month. By night the Commons transforms into a pleasant outdoor meeting point for all residents. Townsfolk meet to conduct [[Hopeknife|hopeknife]] ceremonies for their youth, and indulge in any other cause of festivity. The stage is used for announcements and occasional theatrical performances.
