> **Cove Hall** is located at the center of the town of [[Roderic's Cove|Roderics Cove]] in [[Varisia]]. It stands near the [[Circle]] opposite to [[Creekside Tavern and Inn]]. This building was one of the first built in Roderic's Cove and served as communal housing in those early days as the rest of the town was being built. Every law penned governing the town is preserved in Cove Hall, as are [[Aurek Roderic|Sir Aurek Roderics]] cartographic efforts depicting the region. [[Larenza Thort|Port-Governor Larenza Thort]] keeps her office in this building, as has every port-governor since the town's founding.
