> The **Long Roads Coffeehouse** is one of numerous small restaurants, eateries, and coffee houses scattered across the [[Villegre]] district of [[Kintargo]] in [[Cheliax]]. It is located north of [[Villegre Park]].
> Its owner, [[Laria Longroad]], has a dedicated, if eclectic, clientele: a mixture of wide-eyed students from the [[Alabaster Academy]] and other educational institutions, alongside noble patrons from the neighbouring [[The Greens|Greens]] district. The Long Roads Coffeehouse's success is partially due to the quality of its drinks and food, including traditional [[Halfling|halfling]] cuisine, but it also serves as a front for Laria's connections with the illegal [[Bellflower Network]] and seemingly every other rogue and revolutionary in the city.
> Hidden beneath the coffee house is a subterranean hideout known as **The Wasp Nest** that has long been used by smugglers and folk in need of privacy. The Wasp Nest once served as a secret shrine devoted to [[Calistria]] that survived the initial banning of her religion under [[House Thrune]] and boasts handy access to the sewers and storm drains.
