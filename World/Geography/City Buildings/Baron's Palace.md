> The Baron's Palace is built in [[4219 AR]]. It belongs to the city of [[Anthusis|Eleder]] and it is ceded to the Grand Custodian of [[Sargava]]. The mansion rests on a huge, 2-acre stretch of property located in the heart of [[New Haliad]]. The palace faces the harbor, overlooking both the granite piers and [[Lower Harbor]]. The famous Baronial Gardens lie within the area of the palace as well as the impressive horse stables, the Custodial Granaries and the Custodial Armory. Sargava's treasure is secured somewhere beneath the Custodial Armory in a great stone vault.
