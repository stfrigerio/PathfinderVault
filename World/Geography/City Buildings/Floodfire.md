> One of the few buildings on [[Kyver's Islet|Kyvers Islet]] not dedicated to industry, **Floodfire** is in fact a lighthouse. Floodfire is located on the very northern most tip of Kyver's Islet, it was put there to warn people away from the dangerous sandbars that surround the island and the estuary of the [[Yondabakari River]]. Floodfire is not a particularly large lighthouse, especially when compared with [[Varisia|Varisias]] most famous lighthouse, [[Lady's Light|The Ladys Light]].
