> The **Zradnirri Arcolleges** was a location of fabled magic found in the [[Iobaria|Iobarian]] city of [[Zradnirras]]. The city is now in ruins, but the legends of the Arcolleges still draw explorers and [[Adventurer|adventurers]] who are willing to brave the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Goblin|goblins]], [[Kobold|kobolds]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dragon|dragons]] who now call the city home.
