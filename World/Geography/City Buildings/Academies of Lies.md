> The many **Academies of Lies** are vast, temple-like libraries that rest upon the rare spots of solid ground in [[Stygia]]. Within the walls of these acropolises, [[Hell]]'s most nefarious minds make blasphemous discoveries and cultivate profane [[Philosophy|philosophies]] which they use to corrupt the [[Great Beyond|multiverse]]. When an [[Osyluth|osyluth]] learns of a great discovery whilst tormenting a [[Damned|damned]] [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioner]] in the wilds of Stygia, they bring the knowledge to one of these libraries to be recorded upon a living [[Scroll|scroll]] made from the flesh of a tortured [[Soul|soul]].
