> The **Third Wish Inn** is located in the [[East Drenches]] district of the city of [[Corentyn]]. It is owned by [[Pfellio Indergrast]], who claims to trace his lineage back to old [[Cheliax|Chelish]] nobility and frequently recounts his long story of his family's poor fortune. His wife [[Shilandra Indergrast|Shilandra]] also works in the inn, which provides comfortable rooms and hot food. It is rather expensive but the accommodation is worth the money.
