> The **Devil's Own** is a shipyard in the [[The Docks|Docks]] district of the city of [[Absalom]]. The shipyard specializes in [[Ship|war galleys]] used by Absalom's navy and sold to the markets throughout the [[Inner Sea]]. Its owner, Lord [[Archych of House Dureanz]] is a loyal [[Cheliax|Chelaxian]]. He employs the worst thugs and pushes around his considerable weight at every opportunity. The machinations of Lord Archych and those of his rival [[Goodmiss Alidane of House Candren]], manager of the [[Sea King Shipyard]], are the main source of intrigue and violence in the Docks.
