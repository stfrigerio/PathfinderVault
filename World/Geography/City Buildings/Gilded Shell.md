> The **Gilded Shell** is a gigantic tortoise-shaped building situated in the [[Dawn Gate]] district of [[Katapesh]]. The surface of the building is covered with gleaming metal plates, designed and installed by a master armorer named [[Malthus Feyhew]].
> Feyhew and his staff of apprentices and journeymen craft high-quality and greatly valued suits of [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]], all of masterwork quality. The master armorer tasks special interest in unusual materials, and keeps a standing offer to his clients to build custom armor from such materials at a 50-percent discount. He also keeps an inventory of special and unusual armors, including [[Giant scorpion|giant scorpion]] shells, [[Blink dog|blink dog]] hides, [[Gorgon|gorgon]] hides, gray render hides, [[Naga]] scales, bone mail, and [[Wyvern|wyvern]] hides.
