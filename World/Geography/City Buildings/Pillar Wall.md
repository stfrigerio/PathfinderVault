> Stretching across multiple districts of [[Korvosa]], **Pillar Wall** is one of three colossal pieces of ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] architecture that have come to define the skyline of the city. Stretching across Citadel Hill, what remains of the ancient Pillar Wall is a hundred feet high and forms the border of three districts: [[Heights|The Heights]], [[Gray district|Gray]], and [[South Shore]]. At its western end, stands the almost equally impressive [[Gatefoot]].
