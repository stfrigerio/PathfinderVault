> **Darakole Sanitarium**, set in the [[River District Vyre|River District]] neighbourhood of [[Pauper's Palace|Paupers Palace]], takes in those who [[Vyre|Vyres]] heady delights have mentally destroyed. Those who have dangerously over-indulged in powerful [[Drugs|drugs]], been exposed to sanity-shattering dark rites, or have broken under crushing mental strains of the City of Masks (and have friends rich enough to keep them from the grasp of [[Dunrock Prison]]) may find themselves sequestered here. Though better than the [[Hell|Hellish]] depths of Dunrock Prison, Darakole Sanitarium is far from gentle on those confined there. The sanitarium is run by a powerful [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemist]] called [[Anja Creeve]] who is also a secret devotee of the [[Deity|god]] [[Norgorber]] in his aspect as [[Blackfingers]], master of [[Poison|poisons]]. Anja, and her Norgorber-worshipping orderlies, experiment on the patients in their charge, testing strange new drugs and poisons on them.
