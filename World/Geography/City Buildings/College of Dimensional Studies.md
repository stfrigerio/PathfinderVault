> One of the many [[Magic|magical]] fraternities that make their home in the city of [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]], the **College of Dimensional Studies** specializes in magic relating to interdimensional travel or visiting truly distant parts of the [[Material Plane]]. The domed building of the college sits in the crowded [[Inner City District of Katapesh|Inner City]] district of Katapesh and contains not only the normal dormitories and laboratories expected of a [[Wizard|wizards]] college, but also a huge telescope open even for the general public's use on some nights. The College of Dimensional Studies is also, therefore, known to be one of the foremost schools of [[Astronomy|astronomy]] in the [[Inner Sea region]].
> One of the most unique features of the college is its lack of doors. All students are expected to possess an array of travel [[Magic|magic]] and are expected to be able to *[[Teleport|teleport]]* between rooms. Students of the college are also expected to create [[Scroll|scrolls]] of transport magic as part of their payment for the college's unique education. The College of Dimensional Studies is also one of the few institutions on [[Golarion]] to house one of the rare and mysterious astralabes, devices of enormous utility to those seeking to explore the [[Plane|planes]] of the [[Great Beyond]].
