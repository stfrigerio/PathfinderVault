> The **Pig's Paunch** is a tavern in [[The Coins]] district of [[Absalom]]. The Pig's Paunch was one of the bars at which the [[Pathfinder Society]] was founded on 23 [[Desnus]], [[4307 AR]], and at one point had been a subject of dispute over the Society's founding.



## Structure

> The Pig's Paunch is a dilapidated tavern marked by a sign of a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Level 1/Pig|pig]] standing on its rear legs, its arms crossed over its belly.


## History

> The Pig's Paunch's role in founding the Pathfinder Society was in doubt for much of its history, with some Pathfinders contesting that the Society had been formally created instead at the [[Wounded Wisp]]. However, writings of founding Pathfinder [[Kerinha Napsunar]] recovered in [[4719 AR]] confirmed the sequence of events — that the ideas coalesced during a pub crawl from the Pig's Paunch to the [[Crimson Coin]] and [[Vert Pippen]], then ending at the Wisp — but also further cemented the Wisp's claim as the home of the Society's naming, foundational concepts, and plans for the first [[Grand Convocation]].


## Relationships

> Due to the Paunch's role in the Society's founding, its agents sometimes use the tavern as a meeting place for socializing or to organize local missions. This includes agents' Confirmation tasks.
