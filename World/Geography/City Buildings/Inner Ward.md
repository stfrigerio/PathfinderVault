### The Great Bazaar

> Referred to as the Suq al-Azzmir Marketplace by efreet this bazaar is one of the largest trading hubs in the [[Great Beyond]]. One can find almost any good imaginable here from the mundane like metals and spices to the magical. However, the principal stock of this great market is the slave trade that flourishes here. Gold isn't the main currency that exchanges hands, that being instead magics which the efreet covet. The only items that are rare to see is anything related to water which is strictly regulated and items that could be used in the binding of genies. This region is among the most diverse of the whole city consisting of many fire immune creators like efreet, azers, salamanders, and fire elementals.


### The Temple Quarter

> Despite being largely aweless toward any deific power the efreet nonetheless construct buildings honoring many powerful beings of flame including images of the grand sultan himself. As an effort to ingratiate themselves with divine beings this section of the city seems to constantly expand with new great temples as well as ancient treasures to fill them. Among the temples here you can find the palace of [[Ymeri]], the Elemental Queen of the Inferno, one of the most powerful beings on the whole plane of fire. Despite the grandeur of her temple and the semi-frequent visits of the Grand Sultan [[Ymeri]] has visited the palace only a handful of times since its construction; doing so twice to wreak havoc on the efreet. 


### The Noble Quarter

> The wealthiest of the city’s districts, the Noble Quarter is part of the innermost section of the Inner Ward with the heart of it being filled by the Grand Sultan’s palace. The Noble Quarter lies at the bottom of the basin that is the City of Brass, though its towers particularly the palace peak high above the city proper. Beneath these towers flow marvelous pools of raining sulfur and quicksilver, while haughty palanquins carried by armies of slaves crowd the streets. The Noble Quarter is where you can find the scheming genies plotting amongst sycophants and vying for the Grand Sultan's favor. It is in the heart of this district that the governance of this great nation takes place.
