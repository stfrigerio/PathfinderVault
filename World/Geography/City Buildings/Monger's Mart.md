> The **Monger's Mart** is a cheap open market in the [[Coins]] district of [[Absalom]] where poor quality goods are sold. Spoiled cheeses, meats, and especially spices that have lost their value are sold in huge tents by sellers from all over the world. The Monger's Mart is full-to-bursting with tents of sellers from [[Vudra]] and [[Osirion]], even [[Elephant|elephants]] carrying mobile shops from [[Taldor]] and [[Qadira]].
