> The **Imperial Naval Shipyards** manufacture huge, superior-quality [[Ship|war vessels]] for the [[Taldan Imperial Navy]]. The secret behind this quality lies in the [[Blackwood tree|blackwood trees]] harvested by the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of [[Wildwood Lodge]] and sent to [[Cassomir]] in great volumes. The towering skeletons of dozens of ships in various phases of construction characterize this district. Around the shipyards, woodworkers, rope-makers, tar and pitch factories, sail weavers, and lumber mills represent a bustling industry surrounding the shipyards. The district also houses the industries of interest to sailors, like brothels, moneylenders, inns, pubs, fighting pits, shrines, and open-air markets. The [[Cassomir constabulary]] heavily patrols the shipyards at night, though it is difficult to keep crime at bay.
> [[Ethem Baler]], a white-haired ancient [[Gnome|gnome]], is the Imperial Naval Shipyards' chief shipwright, and [[Zaganos|Brother Zaganos]] represents the Wildwood Lodge in Cassomir. Zaganos oversees the trade relations between [[Taldor]] and the druids and works closely with Ethem and other gnome shipwrights in the shipyards.
