**Clenchjaw's**, named for its owner Rinston "Clenchjaw" Jom, was once a much quieter tavern than it is now. Sitting in the [[Yolubilis Harbor]] district of [[Kintargo]] meant that, when the nearby [[Thrashing Badger]] burned down during the [[KintargoHistory|Night of Ashes]], Clenchjaw's gained an influx of rowdy dockworkers and wannabe revolutionaries that has disrupted the once quieter bar. Now brawls and intrigue have become a regular part of the bar's life. Little known to either Clenchjaw's owner or its patrons is that much of this trouble is due to a new resident, a mischievous [[Faerie dragon|faerie dragon]] intent on causing trouble.
