> The **Archstone Monument** stands near the western end of the [[Field of Concord]] in the [[Andoran|Andoren]] capital of [[Almas]] [[Liberty District]]. It was a gift of the [[Gillman|gillmen]], who gave it to the people of Andoran in [[4670 AR]] in recognition of their embrace of freedom and equality after the [[People's Revolt|Peoples Revolt]]. It contains the keystone of the famous [[Arch of Aroden]], which the gillmen dragged to Andoran from the [[Hespereth Strait]]. The citizens of Almas often touch the keystone, believing it will give them good luck.
