 A cyphermage.
> The **Cypher Lodge** in [[Riddleport]] is a grand building made of stone and timber. It sits perched upon a lonely crag in [[Windward District]], and provides a panoramic view of both the gulf and the city. Its three wings look directly out over the [[Cyphergate]]. The Cypher Lodge is the headquarters of the [[Order of Cyphers]]. The lodge and its extensive libraries are open to all members of the Order for a monthly room-and-board fee of 5 gp. To non-members, the daily fee is 20 gp. The guest rooms are frequently full, despite these prices.
> Cypher Lodge is a combination of library, laboratory, research hall, and museum where [[Cyphermage|cyphermages]] pursue the secrets of [[Thassilon]].
