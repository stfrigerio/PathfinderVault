> Over the western bridge from [[Oozefront]] lies **Bonerattle**, [[Urglin]]'s religious center. Here, priests of [[Rovagug]] reign supreme. Their cathedral has been built to resemble an arachnid with a spider's mouth as the temple's entrance. Leathery palisades framed with bones from [[Aurochs|aurochs]], other megafauna, and the occasional, unlucky humanoid form the majority of the structure here. The priests are known as "Bonecarvers," and they  serve as [[Urglin]]'s guards though formal request has been made to do so.
