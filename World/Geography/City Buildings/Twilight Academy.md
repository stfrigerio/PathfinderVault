> The **Twilight Academy** is a major center for [[Magic|magical]] learning in [[Varisia]]. Located in the small town of [[Galduria]], it was founded by mages who wished to sidestep the politics of the larger magical colleges in [[Korvosa]] and [[Magnimar]]. Because of this, it is looked down upon by the other Varisian schools, who consider it an upstart with no sense of tradition or history.
> The Academy has always had the reputation of promoting unconventional theories of magic while applying few strictures on its students, leading to the occasional [[Spell|spell]] going awry. This was most memorably demonstrated in [[4688 AR]], when a group of precocious [[Necromancer|necromancers]] from the Academy lost control of their [[Carrion golem|carrion golems]]. The [[Construct|constructs]] went on a horrible spree of destruction in the countryside that is remembered to this day.
> The building that houses the Academy is constructed more like a small fortress, with numerous mundane and magical defenses. Some speculate that these defenses are designed more to keep people in, rather than to keep intruders away.

> The **Harrowed Society** is a secretive group of study at the Academy that researches the use and history of the [[Harrow]]. Its students are often [[Arcanist|arcanists]] who meld [[Psychic magic|psychic magic]] into their work.
