> ***The Curious Goblin*** is a rather complete collection of books for sale located in the town of [[Sandpoint]]. That said, the shop's owner, [[Chask Haladan]], seems more interested in collecting books and tomes rather than running a profitable business.



## Appearance

> The building that houses *The Curious Goblin* is noted by a sign in front of the shop, that of a [[Goblin|goblin]] reading a book sized for a being much larger than itself.


## Services

> Though *The Curious Goblin* houses an extensive inventory of books for sale, most are priced well beyond levels affordable by those living in the community of Sandpoint; Haladan seems to consider the gathering of his tomes more important than succeeding at business. The shop owner has been known to allow guests to freely peruse his inventory rather than part with his prized possessions.


## Notable individuals

> Regular visitors to *The Curious Goblin* include [[Brodert Quink]], [[Sabyl Sorn]], and Ilsorai Gandethus. Such guests can often be found seated in the shop's reading chairs or engaged in discussion amongst themselves and the shop's owner.
> [[Chask Haladan]] is the owner of *The Curious Goblin*. During his earlier years, this bard worked as an [[Adventurer|adventurer]]; the funds he earned early in life ensure the continued operation of his shop, despite a history of lackluster sales.
