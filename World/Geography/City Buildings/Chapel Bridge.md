> The **Chapel Bridge** is a wooden drawbridge that can span the [[Path River]] at [[Grayce]] in the county of [[Caliphas]] in [[Ustalav]] linking the town to the [[Gravelands]]. From the southern end of the bridge, roads lead to the ruins of [[Vigil]], north-west of Grayce, and to [[Vellumis]] to the south. It is called the Chapel Bridge as it is built through an ancient shrine to [[Pharasma]].
