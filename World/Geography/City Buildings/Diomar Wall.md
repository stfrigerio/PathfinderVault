> The **Diomar Wall** is constructed in [[Anthusis|Eleder]] by the Baron Cymdon Diomar to protect the colony from the savage lands beyond. It is built from large chunks of rough-cut granite cemented together with mud-daub. It is a mighty granite defense that stands over 15 feet tall and is 5 feet thick. Three gates allow passage into the inner city: the Militia Gate in [[Portside Eleder district|Portside]] and the Baron's Gate and Grallus Gate in [[New Haliad]].
