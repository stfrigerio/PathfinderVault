> The **Absalom Mint** is a stone building near [[Azlanti Keep]] that produces much of [[Absalom|Absaloms]] [[Coin|coinage]]—a function that, due to the City at the Center of the World's outsized influence on trade and commerce, literally and figuratively shapes money across the [[Inner Sea region]] and beyond. Coins minted in Absalom are either accepted in locations as distant as [[Tian Xia]] and [[Vudra]], or is the standard by which nations measure and mint their own currency.
