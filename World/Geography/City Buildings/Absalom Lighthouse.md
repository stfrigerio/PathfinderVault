> **Absalom Lighthouse** is located on [[Pilot Island]] at the center of [[Absalom]]'s [[Flotsam Graveyard|Ship Graveyard]]. It is a famed piece of architecture built under the command of the [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]] himself. At 655 feet in height, the light from its tower can be seen from as far as 50 miles away on a clear night and at least 25 miles on stormy evenings or bright afternoons. All [[Inner Sea]] navigators know its light, which has helped make the City at the Center of the World a successful trade port. Along with the [[Blue Tower]], the [[Spire of Nex]], and the peaks of the [[Kortos Mounts]], it is among the most recognizable parts of Absalom's skyline.
