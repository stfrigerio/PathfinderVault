> Near the docks may be found a private pub called the **Bell of the Sea** managed by clerics of [[Iomedae]], offering typical pub and restaurant services. In the basement, however, is a meeting place for 'tillers' of the [[Bellflower Network]], a secret organization dedicated to freeing halfling slaves in Cheliax. The basement also serves as a secret hideout, or 'barn', for keeping slave escapees before an escape route is started.
