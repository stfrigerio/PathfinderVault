Found in a desolate valley at the foot of the [[Mindspin Mountains]] in north-eastern [[Varisia]], the **Obelisk Forest of Mundatei** is a ruin from the time of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] empire and was built with the labor of [[Slavery|enslaved]] [[Rune giant|rune]] and [[Stone giant|stone giants]]. Thousands of ten-foot-high stones, some carved with [[Rune|runes]], are scattered about the landscape, and it has long been rumored that they are hollow and hold treasure. A century ago, an expedition from [[Korvosa]] tried to confirm this by breaking open some of them. They found that the obelisks were indeed hollow, each holding the desiccated body of a [[Human|human]] who had died in terror and horrific pain. According to the Korvosan survivors, they were assaulted by strange [[Undead|undead]] that night who dragged off a dozen of their companions. The next morning it was discovered that the broken obelisks had wholly reformed. The site has been avoided ever since.
