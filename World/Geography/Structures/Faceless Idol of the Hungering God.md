> This enormous idol stands in a northern corner of the vault known as the [[Land of Black Blood]], in [[Orv]]. It depicts a pot bellied figure with dog-like legs and a mouth full of sharp teeth. However its face lacks any other features, hence the name of **Faceless Idol of the Hungering God**. 
> A number of the vault's denizens venerate the idol, but it plays a particularly large role in the religion of the [[Charda|chardas]]. they hold religious ceremonies here every 12 days, and do not tolerate intruders. They consider the idol to be a representation of one of their deities, [[Orgesh]], and leave offerings of food on the altar at its base.
> For whatever reason, the idol does have magical properties. Those who approach it but do not leave an offering of food risk being cursed for a day, whilst those who participate in the sacrifice of a sentient humanoid on the altar receive a blessing for the same period.
> The ancient carvers of the idol also built the nearby city of [[Orgeshta]].
