> The ruined city of **Rastel** was once a thriving settlement of the now-extinct nation of [[Rastel]]. The ruins stand upon the banks of the Upper Korir River, in the [[Korir Plains]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. In common with all ruins of the Rastel culture, the ruined city of Rastel shows signs of fire, conflict, and cannibalism.
> Today, the ruins are home to a small number of [[Tiefling|tieflings]] of [[Zenj]] descent. They carry out the traditional Zenj practice of [[Ancestor worship|ancestor worship]], and include their fiendish ancestors within this. Among these are a group of fiends the tieflings refer to as the [[Waiting Ones]], who they believe are asleep beneath the city.
