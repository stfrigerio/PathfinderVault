**Dead Man's Dome** is a cairn to a fallen soldier who died defending what used to be a mighty watchtower against a force of [[Giant|giants]] and [[Undead|undead]]. It is located far to the north of the continent of [[Tian Xia]] on the polar ice of the [[Crown of the World]] and overlooks the tundra basin of Ruun Uvas near the [[Path of Aganhei]]. The site is said to still be guarded by the spirit of the dead warrior whose name was never known.
