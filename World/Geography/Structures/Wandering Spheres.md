> The **Wandering Spheres** is a massive ruined orrery located in central [[Kyonin]] with [[Human|human-sized]] planetary spheres that once must have risen above the treetops. Its mechanism shattered long ago, and the many models of celestial objects now lie scattered about the glade, or are attached to metal beams that are twisted. No one knows how the orrery was destroyed, but what is even stranger, is that it models a [[Solar system|solar system]] that is not that of [[Golarion]].
