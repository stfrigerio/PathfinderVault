> The **Akrizoth Horologe** is one of the wonders of the [[Darklands]]. A huge clock, it stands in the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Duergar|duergar]] capital of [[Hagegraf]]. It has six hands, and has numbers in seven languages. It was built by a duergar who claimed to have escaped from the [[Ashen Forge]], [[Droskar]]'s realm in the [[Abyss]]. For those able to read it, it measures the passage of the sun over [[Highhelm Militia]] and also reputedly measures the output of Droskar's forges, making it of interest to Droskar's priests.
