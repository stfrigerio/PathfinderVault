> **Raven's Beak** is a ruined fort just north of the [[Marideth River]] in [[Nirmathas]]. It was destroyed in a battle between [[Molthune|Molthuni]] [[Wizard|wizards]] and an [[Earth elemental|earth elemental]] summoned by a Nirmathi [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]]. The government has not rebuilt the fort due to its lack of strategic purpose. A rumored treasure trove hidden beneath the fort bring adventurers to the site despite the danger from [[Ettercap|ettercaps]] and [[Giant spider|giant spiders]].
