> In the past, the folk of the city of **Mbaiki** revered the [[Animal|animals]] of the jungle, and the [[Jaguar|jaguar]] above all others. The people all wished to emulate the jaguarâ€”and something answered their call. The people rejoiced until it became clear that instead of being shapechangers they were condemned to live in jaguar form forever. In their rage they destroyed their city and then they moved into the jungle in small groups. It is said that some of the jungle's jaguars retain the knowledge of the Mbakai tribe, and can offer sage advice to those who know how to ask.
> Today, the remains of the city are home to the most numerous tribe of [[Halfling|halflings]] in the [[Kaava Lands]], the Hazh'a. They revere [[Lamashtu]] and [[Zura]], and collect the heads of intruders.
