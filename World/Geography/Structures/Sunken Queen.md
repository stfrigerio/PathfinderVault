 The Sunken Queen.
> The **Sunken Queen**, once known as the **Shining Queen**, is a partially submerged [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] pyramid built over 10,000 years ago by the [[Runelord]] [[Sorshen]] in what was then the nation of [[Eurythnia]]. It is located in southern [[Varisia]] in an enormous swampland known as the [[Mushfens]], approximately 160 miles west of the city of [[Korvosa]].

## Appearance


> Each side of the four-sided pyramid is embossed with a bas-relief sculpture of the naked Runelord Sorshen, and one side of the structure has sunk so far into the surrounding marsh, that the pyramid now rests at a severe angle. Strange, curving towers rise above the pyramid's peak, resembling organic growths of chimneys. Legend tells of multiple layers of dangerous catacombs contained within the pyramid holding secrets of Ancient Thassilon.
