> Within the blasted wasteland of [[The Furrows|the Furrows]] are found destroyed noble houses and estates. The two most notorious are [[Candlehalls]] and the **House of Ensland**. The latter lies some four leagues from the ruins of the village of [[Feldgrau]] amidst the vast and blackened trench system called the [[Dead Man's Maze|Dead Mans Maze]]. The estate is almost certainly haunted, as [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]] lights are seen playing around the grounds and other-worldly gamblers are known to frequent these noble houses trying to entrap wanderers across the charred lands. One unsuspecting gambler was a greedy knight officer, called [[Lecit Ghazts]], who gambled away his body to a [[Devil|devil]] in the House of Ensland; Ghazts' head still rolls around the Furrows looking for his, or someone else's, body.
