> **The Eternal Shackle** is a 20-foot-tall stone arch monument at the northernmost edge of [[Misery Row]] in [[Absalom]]. A massive [[Magic|magic]] flame burns beneath the arch. Locals say that the flame did not burn for decades until the [[Flesh Tax|Flesh Taxes]] were reinstated in [[4635 AR]], legalizing [[Slavery|slavery]] once more. From time to time, a hermit or madman comes to the monument to venerate [[Droskar]], the Dark Smith and [[Deity|god]] of slavery.
