> The **Aspodean Wall** runs from the base of the [[Aspodell Mountains]] down to [[Aspo Bay]]. It is a massive fortification of [[Cheliax]] against the [[Andoran|Andoren army]], filled with emplacements and only a single huge gate. Cross-country merchants are protesting but the military planners are ignoring their petitions. The construction of the great wall is supported by the architects of [[Brastlewark]].
