> **Scar Thicket** is a forbidding overgrown area deep in the [[Whisperwood]] of [[Cheliax]], tucked between the flows of the [[Doracium River|Doracium]], [[Malvesa River|Malvesa]], and [[Iseld River|Iseld]] rivers. Infrequently visited because of its evil reputation, this area remains a primal woodland and frequently features in hushed conversations and outlandish stories. Everything from monstrous insects, deformed beasts, and even enormous flying creatures are rumored to emerge from its depths. 


## Inhabitants

> In reality, the central area is home to great quantities of [[Russet mold|russet mold]] that are cultivated and managed by a large tribe of surface-dwelling [[Vegepygmy|vegepygmies]]. The entire Scar Thicket contains dozens of small caves that wind deeply into the earth and connect to the [[Midnight Jungle]] in [[Nar-Voth]].
> The Scar Thicket is also home to [[Cave giant|cave giants]] who launch raids from their lairs here. The [[Order of the Pike]] is particularly skilled at hunting these [[Giant|giants]].
