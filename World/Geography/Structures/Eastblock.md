> The **Eastblock** is an impressive structure in the town of [[Elokolobha]], located far to the east, in the boundary of the [[Screaming Jungle]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. It is located within the [[Ukabalimeli-Bara]] region of the town, controlled by the [[Graveborn tribe]] of [[Eloko]]. It is a massive wedge of carved stone and inside its hollow walls, a 1,000-foot-tall staircase permits entrance to the city without the need to climb the dangerous crags.
