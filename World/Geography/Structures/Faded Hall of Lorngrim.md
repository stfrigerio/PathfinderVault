The **Faded Hall of Lorngrim** was built by a long-forgotten [[Dwarf|dwarven]] lord of [[Zavaten Gura]] to serve as a summer palace. It is located in the Hills of Mournful Calling near the [[Avistan|Avistani]] approach to the [[Crown of the World]] and overlooks a necropolis of dwarven tombs, barrows, and mausoleums.


## Inhabitants

> The Faded Halls are now the domain of the strongest [[Giant|giants]] who remain in the area. The necropolis has been desecrated, but not destroyed, and the various stone mausoleums and tombs have been repurposed as dwellings for the giants and their [[Slave|slaves]].
