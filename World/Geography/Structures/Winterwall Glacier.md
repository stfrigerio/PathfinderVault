Winterwall Glacier, at top, borders [[Irrisen]] to its south, the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] to its southwest, and the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] to its southeast.
> The **Winterwall Glacier** is a truly massive sheet of ice stretching down from the [[Crown of the World]] into far-northern [[Avistan]]. A truly desolate and cold land, it is the home of [[Frost giant|frost giants]], [[Ice linnorm|ice linnorms]], [[White dragon|white dragons]], and even more dangerous creatures.


## Geography

> Its western terminus can be found in the northeastern edges of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], where it begins to the east of the [[Stormspear Mountains]].  Its edge then dips southward into the frigid land of [[Irrisen]], continuing in a generally easterly direction, until the [[Tusk Mountains]] in the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] form its eastern border.


## Settlements

> Two small settlements can be found at the southern edges of the glacier: the frost giant citadel of [[Holvirgang]], and the gateway to the far-away continent of [[Tian Xia]], [[Icestair]].
