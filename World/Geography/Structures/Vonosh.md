> **Vonosh** was founded in [[3314 AR]] after the [[Winter War]] to serve as the provincial capital of [[Hoarwood province|Hoarwood]]. In [[3444 AR]], [[Morgannan|Queen Morgannan]] razed the city to the ground in a storm of fire and ice and executed all residents of Vonosh — regardless of guilt or innocence — for their part in a plot to overthrow her and in retribution for the death of her daughter.
> Following the [[Hoarwood Rebellion]] in [[3445 AR]], the [[Heralds of Summer's Return|Heralds of Summers Return]] tried to use the ruins of Vonosh as a base for guerrilla strikes against the new provincial capital city of [[Hoarwood]]. The plan failed because of the angry, restless spirits of those who had been executed by the queen. Some of the Heralds did not escape the attack of the spirits inhabiting the ruins.
