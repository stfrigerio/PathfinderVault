 A [[Meteor|meteor]] destroys Celwynvian.
> The ancient [[Elf|elven]] capital city of **Celwynvian** (pronounced sehl-WIN-vee-enn) sits amid the [[Mierani Forest]] in northern [[Varisia]]. Abandoned by the elves when they departed [[Golarion]] prior to the [[Earthfall]], the city became overridden with [[Drow|drow]], and was the site of one of the most vicious conflicts between the two elven races upon their return from [[Sovyrian]]. Taking considerable losses from the drow's [[Evil|evil]] tactics, the elves once again departed the city, and it remains empty and forbidden to this day.
> The elves of the Mierani Forest strictly prohibit outsiders from entering the city, under the guise of wanting to preserve it as a refuge from the rest of the world, but those more familiar with the region sense that the elves themselves avoid the city and are still involved in an ongoing war to reclaim it.
