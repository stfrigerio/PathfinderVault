> **Covenant Rock** is a small, flat rock that sits along the northern reaches of the [[Flood Road]]. The only thing exceptional about this otherwise uninteresting rock is its use. Caravans traveling the Flood Road place here their tribute to the [[Dragon|dragons]] of [[Raschka-Tor]] in exchange for safe passage through the dragons' territory. These tributes can consist of anything ranging from treasure to livestock to [[Slavery|slaves]]. Regardless of what is given, it is seen as better than facing the wrath of the dragons of Raschka-Tor.
> The [[Half-orc|half-orc]] [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemist]] [[Rzonca|Rzonca the Clever]] resides in a small hut in the shadow of the Covenant Rock and she acts as the agent of the [[Red dragon|red dragons]] of Raschka-Tor.
