> The **Creeping Watcher** is a 70-foot-tall statue in the heart of the [[Vargas Swamp]]. 
> Though draped in vines and surrounded by dense trees, the Creeping Watcher resembles its sister statue, the [[Crouching Jackal]]. its body is sleek and cat-like, though covered in carved scales while its head is clearly reptilian. Unlike the Crouching Jackal, the Creeping Watcher is not carved from a single solid lump of stone, and its eyes are made of some sort of luminous yellow stone. Like its sister statue, the Creeping Watcher's origins are surrounded by mystery, though it is generally held that the Creeping Watcher is the more sinister of the two. Some even suppose that the Crouching Jackal serves as some sort of guardian keeping the Creeping Watcher in check. Whatever the truth is, the location has a bad reputation nowadays as it is believed to be the site of foul worship and evil rituals.
