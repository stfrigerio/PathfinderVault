> The **Adamantine Crucible** is one of the largest buildings among Axis's uncountable structures, containing almost 100 square miles of metalworks. It is both a towering fortress and the essential foundry of its [[Inevitable|inevitables]].


## Appearance

> The crucible is a block-like black and gray structure about 10 miles across that towers over and sharply contrasts with nearby buildings. Exhaust towers that jut from its exterior emit smoke and steam from its inner operations.


## Staff and operations

> The foundry uses giant machines to process ore and features massive smelting pits, with each production line working in complete independence of the rest—even if every other line fails, the crucible can continue to produce inevitables. Master Smith Laikorus has managed this process for almost 9,000 years.
