**Terapasillion** (which means "Ziggurat of Night" in the [[Shadowtongue]]) is an ancient step pyramid eternally cloaked in shadows that predates [[Taldan]] settlement in the region, and is located on the northwestern plains of [[Cheliax]] near [[Nidal]]. It is rumored to have been built by [[Shadow giant|shadow giants]] during the [[Age of Darkness]], but was more recently inhabited by an [[Umbral dragon|umbral dragon]]. Despite the fact that the [[Dragon|dragon]] has not been seen in decades, locals still avoid the place with a passion.
