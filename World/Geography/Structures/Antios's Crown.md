> **Antios's Crown** is a sprawling burial area located at the summit of [[Mount Antios]] in [[Taldor]].
> The entire area is a massive network of opulent shrines, towering statues and ostentatious mausoleums. The streets are richly decorated with fountains and pools throughout the numerous plazas.
> Named after Taldor's tenth emperor, Antios's Crown was greatly valued by Taldan nobles, who went to almost any length for the honour of being entombed at the mountain peak. A great deal of hidden treasure is entombed along with these deceased aristocrats, although would-be tomb-robbers may have to contend with cunning traps and deadly guardians first.
> Being atop such a lofty peak, the rare visitor must contend with freezing temperatures in addition to altitude sickness. However, the view of the [[Tandak Plains]] far below is quite spectacular.
