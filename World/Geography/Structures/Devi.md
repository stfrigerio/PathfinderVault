> **The Devi** is a colossal statue that sits on an island in the [[Kalyan River]] near where it becomes [[Sona Lake]] in the [[Vudra|Vudran]] region of [[Golden Basin]]. The Devi depicts the legendary [[Psychic|psychic]] [[Vanitapati]] who defeated the [[Spawn of Rovagug]] known as [[Kothogaz]], the Dance of Disharmony. It was at this very site that the foul beast was defeated and Vanitapati's two-hundred-foot-tall statue has become not just a site of pilgrimage but also a potent [[Psychic magic|psychic]] nexus.
