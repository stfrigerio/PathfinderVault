> The **Brazen Arch** (also known as the **Brazen Gate**) was a massive [[Teleportation|teleportation]] [[Portal|portal]] built on the orders of the [[Minotaur|minotaur]] warlord [[Voradni Voon]] for his invasion of [[Absalom]] in [[23 AR]]. Using the Arch, Voon brought tens of thousands of [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]], minotaurs, and [[Harpies|harpies]] from distant [[Iblydos]] in [[Casmaron]] to besiege the city, but was ultimately defeated by the forces under the command of the [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]] himself. Aroden scattered Voon's armies and destroyed the Brazen Arch with earthquakes, which led to the formation of an area on the [[Isle of Kortos]] known as the [[Scrape]].
