> A 20-foot-square stone platform in the middle of an otherwise featureless plain in southern [[Katapesh]], **the Observatory** would be of little interest if not for its spectacular [[Magic|magic]].
> The platform's craftsmanship indicates that it is of [[Dwarf|dwarven]] workmanship. In the centre is carved an ornate [[Butterfly|butterfly]], the holy symbol of [[Desna]], while in each corner of the platform stands a pillar. The site is clearly dedicated to the [[God|goddess]] of dreams and travel, and when a person lies on her holy symbol and looks up at the sky, it is vastly magnified. Between the four corner pillars, the night sky appears much closer and clearer, [[Star|stars]] pulse, and distant [[Meteor|meteors]] fly past as if mere feet above.
> It is no surprise this site is seen as holy and attracts worshippers, [[Astronomy|astronomers]], and prophets all seeking inspiration.
