The [[Rovagug]]-worshipping [[Hag|hag]] sisters Grava, Mopple, and Polnivaar Grundlescorn dwell in a marshy section of [[Ravounel Forest]], known as **Grundlescorn Lair**, in a ramshackle hut partially built into the boughs of an ancient oak tree and supported by several crooked but sturdy stilts. The hut looks out over a low hillock in the marsh atop which the hags keep their cauldron and fire pit.
