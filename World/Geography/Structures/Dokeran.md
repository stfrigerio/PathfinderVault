> The ruined city of **Dokeran**, sometimes written **Dokaren**, stands on the [[Defaka River]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. The city was destroyed several centuries ago by [[Tyruwat|Tyruwat the Lost One]] using the [[World/Items & Equipment/Artifacts/Artifact|artifact]] known as the *[[Song of Extinction]]*.
> Tyruwat now lives beneath the city's grand temple, his life greatly extended by the years stolen from his cult and the local tribes using the *Song*. He is guarded by packs of howlers and a tribe of wild [[Elf|elves]] he has subjugated.
> A tapestry of the city hangs in [[Nieford Sharrowsmith|Venture-Captain Nieford Sharrowsmiths]] office, which obscures the secret entrance to the [[Pathfinder lodge]] hidden within [[Sharrowsmith's Exports|Sharrowsmiths Exports]] in [[Nantambu]].
