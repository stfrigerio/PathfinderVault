> **Sueda Lodge** is a [[Pathfinder lodge]] in southeastern [[Katapesh]] that aids [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] and other explorers searching for ancient [[Osirion|Osirian]] artifacts, and also serves as a repository for information.


## History

> The Lodge was established in [[4659 AR]] by Pathfinder Letvis Morgan. The waystation takes its name from the Osirian word *sueda*, which means "discovery".


## Appearance

> The lodge is a low stone building containing six guest rooms, a kitchen, a pantry, a library, and a dining hall. A separate building serves as living quarters for the caretaker of the lodge, and the archives rest in an underground chamber accessible through a secret door in the main lodge. There is a small well in the courtyard and a wall of clay bricks surrounds the enclosure.
> The [[Dwarf|dwarf]] [[Var Pinderven]] is the lodge's current caretaker.
