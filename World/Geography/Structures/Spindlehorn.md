A [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] relic from ancient times, the **Spindlehorn** is a fantastically tall structure located in the [[Wyvern Mountains]] of central [[Varisia]].  Thousands of feet in height, it rises from the shores of the [[Storval Deep]], contradicting all natural laws of architecture and [[Engineering|engineering]].  It is completely featureless except for a winding stair that winds like a corkscrew around its length, terminating in an open platform ten feet in diameter, thousands of feet above.  The view from this platform is easily one of the most terrifying views in all of [[Golarion]].  The purpose of the spire has been lost to time, although it is told that dark-robed figures can be seen ascending, but never descending its heights from time to time.
> Shamans of the [[ShoantiTribes of the Shoanti|Shoanti Shundar-Quah]] tribe hold the Spindlehorn sacred, making pilgrimages there once every ten years to discuss tribal matters of import.
