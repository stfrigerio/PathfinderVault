> **Storasta** was once one of the greatest cities of the [[Kellid]] nation of [[Sarkoris]] in northeastern [[Avistan]]. Founded in [[3844 AR]], it was finally abandoned in [[4644 AR]] like the rest of the [[Worldwound]]. During its occupation, Storasta was overrun by [[Demon|demons]] until it was freed at the end of the [[Fifth Mendevian Crusade]]. Due to its complete corruption, however, the [[Mendevian Crusade|crusaders]] decided to raze the city rather than rebuild it.



## Appearance

> Storasta was a river port located at the confluence of the [[Sarkora River|Sarkora]] and [[West Sellen River|West Sellen Rivers]]. The last city of old Sarkoris to fall after the eruption of the Worldwound, it degenerated into a spectacular ruin. The formerly sacred grove became a heap of rubble and tainted foliage.
> Prior to the Worldwound, Storasta was known for its groves and gardens, but during the time of the Worldwound, it was overrun by [[Assassin vine|assassin vines]], [[Shambling mound|shambling mounds]], and blighted [[Arboreal|arboreals]]. Its ruined walls were turned black by [[Abyss|Abyssal]] fire and were covered with stinking moss and thorns.


## Inhabitants

> After being razed, the ruins of Storasta are now largely abandoned except for the occasional demons who still haunt it.
