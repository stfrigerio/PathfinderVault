> **Pjallarane's Stone** is a rock formation in [[Irrisen]]'s province of [[Thronehold]]. According to legend, [[Baba Yaga]] turned her rebellious daughter [[Pjallarane]] to stone here – and the formation does bear a remarkable resemblance to a woman clinging to a tree and begging for mercy. However, most scholars believe [[Pjallarane]] departed [[Golarion]] with her mother, just like all the other former Queens of Irrisen.
> The stone does seem to have some strange arcane power, however, although no one has ever been able to access it. Some believe the stone might hold the key to banishing Irrisen's eternal winter, although there is scant evidence for this.
> The local [[Snow goblin|snow goblins]] view the stone as a holy site, and occasionally bury offerings to Baba Yaga nearby.
