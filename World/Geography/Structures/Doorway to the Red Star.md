*This article covers the location. For the [[Strength of Thousands]] [[Pathfinder Adventure Path]] issue, see [[Doorway to the Red Star adventure]].*
> The strange **Doorway to the Red Star** lies north of [[Lake Ocota]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. It consists of a ring of mysterious, humming red stones that hangs in an empty courtyard surrounded by overgrown cathedrals.
> Its earliest recorded use was as the headquarters of a nihilistic cult called the [[Throat-of-Nothingness]]. Later, it was the stronghold of the [[King of Biting Ants]]: a sorcerer who was defeated long ago by the legendary [[PathfinderWiki/Ten Magic Warriors]], but the Doorway and the cathedrals were left untouched, by command of [[Jatembe|Old-Mage Jatembe]] himself. Indeed, some legends state that Jatembe himself slew the King of Biting Ants and then sealed up the ruins of the Doorway to the Red Star.
> Those [[Mwangi human ethnicity|Mwangi]] [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] who possess the ability to tap into the latent spiritual energies of the ruins of their ancestors say that the Doorway to the Red Star is second only to the [[Ruins of Kho]] in potency.
> Several [[MwangiZenj|Zenj]] tribes shelter in the triad of the half-collapsed cathedrals surrounding the doorway as even their ruined, crumbling structures are shelter against the harsh jungle. They never go too far inside the complex out of fear of the [[World/Items & Equipment/Artifacts/Artifact|artifact]] within. A core group of powerful magi guardians known as the [[Iobane]], led by [[Mpondo|Warder-Chief Mpondo]], keep outsiders from reaching the Doorway to the Red Star, believing they dishonor their ancestors. They see themselves as the spiritual successors of the Ten Magic Warriors.


## History

> Millennia ago, the highly intelligent mystics of the [[Planet|planet]] [[Akiton]], known as the [[Contemplative of Ashok]] set a powerful artifact within the jungle of Mwangi Expanse. The artifact, a [[Ring|ring]] made of transmuted raw stone from their planet, would maintain a link to Akiton across the cosmic distances. The Doorway to the Red Star is both a transmitter and a beacon, allowing the Contemplates to share the thoughts of those they encounter through it and hopefully lead the people of [[Golarion]] into the path of enlightenment. Almost nobody knows that the ring is also an [[Portal|interplanetary gateway]], long sealed but ready to open again at any time, either because of its own erratic fluctuations or by potent [[Magic|magic]] and knowledge gained by the study of it.
