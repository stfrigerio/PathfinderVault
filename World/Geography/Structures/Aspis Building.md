> The **Aspis Building** is the impressive, pyramid-roofed headquarters of the [[Aspis Consortium]], located in the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] port of [[Ostenso]]. It is here that the [[Patrons]], the Consortium's leaders, meet in secret to discuss the goals and operational intricacies of their organization. Even though the Aspis Building is the corporation's titular headquarters, it also has important regional offices in a number of the major port cities in the [[Inner Sea region]] including [[Azir]] in [[Rahadoum]], [[Anthusis|Eleder]] in [[Sargava]], [[Magnimar]] in [[Varisia]], [[Oppara]] in [[Taldor]], [[Sedeq]] in [[Qadira]], and [[Sothis]] in [[Osirion]].
