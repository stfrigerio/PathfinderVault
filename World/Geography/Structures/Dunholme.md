> **Dunholme** is a ruined settlement in [[Taldor|Taldors]] [[Verduran Forest]]. The site fell victim to a mysterious event known as "the Dunholme Doom" in which an as-yet-unknown threat emerged from a well, first claiming the lives of townsfolk Verniya Klamer, Maix Vivermer, and Jasmique Tunhold. A trade road still runs through Dunholme toward [[Belhaim]] and [[Wispil]] further north.
