> The **Blakros Museum** was the former stronghold of a [[Insanity|mad]] [[Astrology|astrologer]] and [[Wizard|wizard]] named [[Ralzeros|Ralzeros the Overwatched]] in the early history of [[Absalom]].  The mage constructed the building from a solid block of volcanic stone with the aid of dark, alien powers. After his disappearance, the building was eventually bought by the [[Blakros family|Blakroses]], a matriarchal family of influential nobles and [[World/Items & Equipment/Artifacts/Artifact|artifact]] hunters, who filled the building with relics and artifacts collected from throughout the [[Inner Sea region]].



## Description

![[Nigel_Aldain.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Nigel Aldain]], curator of the Blakros Museum.
> The basalt structure is home to the Blakros collection, which includes numerous artifacts of dubious [[Arcane|arcane]] origins. It is located in the [[Wise Quarter]] of Absalom. The museum's exhibits change regularly. The museum's current curator is an unpleasant, former [[Pathfinder Society]] agent named [[Nigel Aldain]]. For several years now, the Blakros Museum's vast collection has been available to the Society, and loyal [[Pathfinder|Pathfinder agents]] are encouraged to report information about new exhibits to their [[Venture-captain|venture-captains]] as soon as they become aware of them.
> Nigel Aldain recently used an artifact known as a *shadow obelisk* to transform the interior of the building, so that it is now larger on the inside than the outside.
