> The **Moon's Eye** is a black granite formation located on the [[Nesmian Plains]] between the [[Deepcut River]] and the [[Marideth River]]. The formation has some religious significance to [[Kellid]] tribes in the area, dating back centuries. Explorers of the region occasionally report finding Kellid ruins in the area surrounding the Moon's Eye, though all reports are inconsistent of the location and description of these ruins. There are reports of unusually large [[Wolf|wolves]] in the area as well.
