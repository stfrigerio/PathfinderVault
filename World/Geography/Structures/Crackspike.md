> **Crackspike** is a formation of prospectors' bones in [[Devil's Perch|Devils Perch]], erected as both a warning and summer roost by the area's native [[Windspire tribe]] of [[Strix|strix]] around [[4690 AR]]. The [[Cheliax|Chelish]] provincial authorities attempted to secure Crackspike around [[4711 AR]] as a base for mining [[Silver|silver]] from [[Sorvus's Strike|Sorvuss Strike]] about two miles northwest of Crackspike; the strix subsequently burned the settlement to the ground.
