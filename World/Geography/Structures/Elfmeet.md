> The **Elfmeet** is a location in [[Icemark]] where the [[Ilverani]] set up camp whenever they visit the region. They generally travel along a coastal route to avoid the dangers of the inner [[Stormspear Mountains]]. Elfmeet features a double ring of standing stones overlooking the sea. The [[Varki]] do not treat this site as one of their villages but often visit the location and engage in trade with Ilverani. The Ilverani are fond of Varki scrimshaw, and often trade potent [[Magic|magical]] items for well-crafted Varki [[Art|art]].
