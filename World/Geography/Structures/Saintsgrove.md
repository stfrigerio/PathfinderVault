**Saintsgrove** is a small area of ancient olive trees in the south-east of the county of [[Sinaria]], in [[Ustalav]], lying near the southern banks of [[Lake Prophyria]], and to the south-east of [[Karcau]].
> Legends speak of a priestess of [[Urgathoa]] who performed a sacrilegious ceremony to transform herself into a [[Daughter of Urgathoa]] at this spot, perverting a shrine of [[Desna]] and sacrificing the followers of the Song of the Spheres as part of her ritual. Such blasphemy apparently stirred Desna to direct action against the priestess by immediately ageing the olive trees by a thousand years trapping the blasphemer and preventing her ritual from succeeding, while providing a grave for her dead worshippers.
