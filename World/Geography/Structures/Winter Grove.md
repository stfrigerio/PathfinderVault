> The Winter Grove is an ancient [[Druid|druids]] grove that lies within the [[Barrowood]] in [[Cheliax]]. Ruined and blackened, the grove predates the old empire of [[Taldor]], before the rise of Cheliax as an independent nation. 
> Rumours say that within the grove lies a summoning circle of ancient origin. Furthermore, within this circle [[Abrogail Thrune I|Abrogail I]] made her dark dealings with [[Asmodeus]]. In recent times, locals to the region have witnessed members of the royal family making regular (but secretive) visits to the site, always bringing sacrificial victims with them.
