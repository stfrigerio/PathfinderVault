Nation: Mwangi Expanse

> The red granite city of **Sele** in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] was once the site of an ancient [[MwangiMauxi|Mauxi]] culture. The city's foundations were built on limestone, and eventually it sank beneath the waters of the [[Mbernbe River]]. This may have been a catalyst for the Mauxi migration into [[Thuvia]]. The only structure which remains above water—a domed palace—is home to a family of [[Wyvern|wyverns]].
