> The ancient ruined fortress of **Spiro Spero** lies north of the [[Ndele Gap]], on the [[Mwangi Expanse]] side of the [[Shattered Range]]. It takes its name from the spiral pathway that winds its way up the mountainside to its gate.


## Structure

> It is of rough construction, almost as if it was made out of boulders, but there are indications that it was built by dwarves. If so, this is something of a mystery, as it appears to predate the [[Sky Citadel|Sky Citadels]], the first surface structures built by the dwarves on the successful completion of their [[Quest for Sky]].


## Occupants

> Today, the fortress is occupied by [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] from [[Katapesh]], although there are rumours that they do not dare to enter its lower levels.
