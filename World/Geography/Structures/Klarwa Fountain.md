> The site known as the **Klarwa Fountain** is in the desert of western [[Osirion]], in the region known as the [[Footprints of Rovagug]]. On the top of a steep cinder cone from a long-extinct volcano that rises hundreds of feet above the surrounding area, a bowl-shaped depression is filled with a pool of rainwater. The water never quite evaporates despite the heat and gases occasionally vent from deep within the cone. From time to time the violent plumes of water are visible from miles away. One such column drew the attention of the anchorite Klarwa as he was dying of thirst in the badlands during the [[Second Age of Osirion|Second Age]], giving the landmark its name. Today the hill is used by the few travelers making their way through western Osirion, and its water makes the ascent up the steep hill well worth the effort. Some hermits live within sight of the Klarwa Fountain hiking up its sides when they driven by desperate thirst, as anchorite holy Klarwa was.
