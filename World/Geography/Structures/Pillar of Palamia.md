> The **Pillar of Palamia** is an ancient obelisk made from basalt believed to be a monument to a forgotten [[God|god]] in the northwestern [[Whisperwood]] of central [[Cheliax]]. Others claim that it is a god's prison, and that the Pillar sticking into the ground is itself the nail holding in the trapped deity.
