> The **Gull** is one of the ten remaining pilings of the [[Irespan]] in [[Magnimar]]. There is an entrance to the interior of the piling located near water level. This 250-feet tall tower is still connected to the bridge deck. Local rumors indicate the [[Sczarni]] use the interior as a base; and indeed it is the home of the particularly unpleasant [[Creepers]] gang of Sczarni.
