 The triple goddess monument at Artrosa.
> **Artrosa**, also called "The Three Who Watch," is a set of three half-mile-tall statues built by [[Baba Yaga]] 2,000 years ago during the [[Age of Enthronement]] to watch over the eastern reaches of [[Iobaria]], which were once ruled by [[Kostchtchie]]. Carved into the tallest mesa of the central [[Deeprun Crevasse]], the three statues can be seen from many parts of Iobaria regardless of the distance.
> The statues are crudely carved, and despite their massive scale, the race they depict is unclear. Each statue represents one of the three stages of womanhood—a long-haired maiden, a pregnant mother, and hunchbacked crone—and each is naked and holding up a hand in a warding gesture.
> Each figure hides within it a [[Magic|magical]] fortress created by Baba Yaga, and each fortress is linked to the others by a series of magical [[Portal|portals]]. Baba Yaga only inhabited Artrosa for a short period to ensure Kostchtchie did not return, and once she was satisfied, she appointed a warden to watch over the fortresses in her absence.
> Despite the harsh terrain and remoteness of the statues, dozens of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] brave the wilds of the Deeprun Crevasse every year, eager to unlock Artrosa's secrets. None is known to have succeeded, and countless remains dot the rocky crevices of Artrosa's plateau.
