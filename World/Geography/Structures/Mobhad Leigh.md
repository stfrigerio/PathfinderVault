From the [[Shoanti]] term meaning "steps into hell," this perfectly circular pit is located at the base of the [[Kodar Mountains]], on the [[Storval Plateau]] of northern [[Varisia]], approximately 25 miles northeast of the source of the [[Aloren River]]. A set of spiral stairs run around the edge of the hole, but ends after only a few hundred feet. Beyond this point it is necessary to climb the sheer walls or fly. Few people know how deep the **Mobhad Leigh** actually is, although some rumor that it is so deep that it bypasses the [[Darklands]] region of [[Nar-Voth]] completely and opens directly into [[Sekamina]].


## Shoanti and the Mobhad Leigh

> The Shoanti of the Storval Plateau avoid the Mobhad Leigh after a number of their shamans died mysteriously while exploring it using [[Magic/Divination|divination]] magics.  Those who do venture close enough have reported seeing dancing orange lights flickering in the pit's depths.


## Entrance to Sekamina

> The rumors about this place are, in fact, correct: the Mobhad Leigh descends about 6,300 feet to the Darklands realm of Sekamina. The ancient [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]] city of [[Sverenagati]] is located nearby, making the Mobhad Leigh the quickest route to reach this dreaded place from the surface.
