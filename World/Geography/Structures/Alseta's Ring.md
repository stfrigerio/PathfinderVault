> **Alseta's Ring** is a ring of six *[[Elf gate|aiudara]]* located beneath [[Citadel Altaerein]] in [[Isger]]. One of the first *aiudara* fashioned on [[Golarion]] by the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Elf|elven]] hero [[Candlaron]], the individual [[Portal|portals]] were placed as close together as possible without their individual energies interfering with each other. Candlaron's work on Alseta's Ring was instrumental to a breakthrough that allowed him to build *aiudara* capable of linking multiple locations, which were more efficient. Although Alseta's Ring would always keep a special place in Candlaron's heart, travel through it was less frequent, and it was little more than a curiosity when the elves left Golarion on the eve of [[Earthfall]].
> After Earthfall, [[Dahak]] discovered a flaw within Alseta's Ring and exploited it to manifest an incarnation of himself in the ruins of Golarion, wreaking havoc for ages until the [[Ekujae]] elves imprisoned the [[Manifestation|manifestation]] in the void between portals in Alseta's Ring. The ensuing [[Magic|magical]] feedback destroyed [[Lotusgate]], which connected Alseta's Ring to [[Kyonin]], cutting it off from the *aiudara* network. By the time the elves returned from [[Sovyrian]], Alseta's Ring was truly forgotten.

> Alseta's Ring contains the following six *aiudara*:
> - **Lotusgate**: The first *aiudara* created by Candlaron, Lotusgate once linked Alseta's Ring to Kyonin until it was destroyed by the backfire of energy resulting from the imprisonment of the avatar of Dahak. The Kyonin side of Lotusgate is now the hub of another *aiudara* network, its connection to Alseta's Ring forgotten.
> - **Huntergate**: Huntergate connects to the [[Mwangi Expanse]] and is associated with [[Ketephys]]. Its upper half is decorated with carvings of [[Hawk|hawks]], Ketephys's [[Sacred animal|sacred animal]], and its lower half with jungle [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Plant|plants]]. Its way station was completely destroyed by the power of Dahak's manifestation when he was trapped within it, and now all that remains of it is a molten tunnel. It exits in a temple to Ketephys maintained by the Ekujae elves native to that area.
> - **Dreamgate**: Dedicated to [[Desna]], Dreamgate connects to the coast of [[Ravounel]] and is adorned with images of [[Star|stars]] and [[Butterfly|butterflies]]. Elven explorers used it to travel to the [[Arcadian Ocean]], eventually settling in the water and becoming the first [[Aquatic elf|aquatic elves]]. Dreamgate's way station was formerly a place where travellers could rest and enjoy prophetic dreams, until a coven of [[Night hag|night hags]] took up residence and corrupted it.
> - **Jewelgate**: Built to honour [[Yuelral]], Jewelgate connects to an underground cavern in the modern [[Five Kings Mountains]], where large crystals of multiple colours grew. Unknown to Candlaron, Jewelgate's destination was controlled by the [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]] who tolerated no intruders, forcing him to abandon it. He stationed the [[Wizard|wizard]] Talamira within the way station as a guardian. The serpentfolk then infused the crystals with a strange magic, which seeped in and polluted the way station. Jewelgate is made of pale green stone shot with red crystalline veins, with a row of stalactites hanging from the arch and a silvery mist dancing within it. Large [[Gemstone|gemstones]] grow from Jewelgate; if pried off, they crumble into dust while others grow to replace them.
> - **Duskgate**: Built for the goddess [[Findeladlara]], Duskgate connects Alseta's Ring to the small town of [[Finderplain]] in [[Katapesh]]. It was the last of the six to be constructed, and was originally designed as a monument to elven architecture and [[Art|art]]. It appears as if made of white marble, with streaks a grey, and when touched feels warm.
> - **Vengegate**: Constructed for [[Calistria]], Vengegate leads to the city of [[Promise]] on the island of [[Hermea]]. It was through Vengegate the the elves who would eventually settle the [[Mordant Spire]] travelled; instead of settling Hermea they chose to explore elsewhere and eventually came across the spire and settled there. They have since forgotten this tale. The way station features vaulted ceilings and magical lighting, and various facilities used by the followers of Calistria. It is also haunted by the spirit of a dead elven lover from a time before [[Earthfall]].
