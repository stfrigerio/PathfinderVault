Nation: Mwangi Expanse
---

> The now-extinct **nation of Rastel** was known for conflict with its neighbours, which at the time included [[Holy Xatramba]]. At its height its territory included the [[Korir Plains]] and part of the [[Screaming Jungle]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].
> It included [[Human|humans]], [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] among its members, and they worshipped a cross-species pantheon of [[Deity|gods]].
> They used dark [[Magic|magic]] in their conquests, but in summoning the horde of [[Demon|demons]] which destroyed Xatramba they may have inadvertently hastened their own downfall.
> In any event, all that remains today are ruins, most notably the ruined cities of [[Rastel city|Rastel]] and [[Liclac]]. These ruins show signs of fire, conflict and cannibalism, and all the temples have been desecrated. However, it is not clear whether the nation fell as a result of civil war, out-of-control demons, or both.
