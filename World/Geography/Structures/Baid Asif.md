> **Baid Asif** ("Bather's Isle" in the [[Giant language|Giant tongue]]) is a [[Storm giant|storm giant]] compound located on the island of [[Jagged Reach]] off the storm-wracked southwestern coast of [[Rahadoum]], hard against the [[Eye of Abendego]]. It is run by [[Arrelious Palamara]], who entertains [[Storm giant|storm giants]] from across [[Golarion]] who make their pilgrimage to the site to witness the fury and power of the never-ending storm. She encourages her visitors to mount expeditions to explore the storm and return to her for lavish feasts and entertainment. Non-giants are strictly prohibited there without a storm giant chaperon.
