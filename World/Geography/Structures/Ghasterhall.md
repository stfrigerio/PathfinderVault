> **Ghasterhall** is an infamous library located in [[Virlych]]. It is also known as the **Palace of Travesties**. Although a place of retained knowledge, Ghasterhall displays horrific methods of storing information. [[Ghast|Ghasts]] possessing oracular power stalk the blood-splattered halls and dead victims are nailed to the walls, used for necromantic experimentation.
> Ghasterhall has been described as an inverted tower-pit, serving as both prison and library. The demi-lich [[Geir]] acts as head researcher for the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]], establishing himself as curator of the massive library, [[Laboratory|laboratory]], and prison. Although a horde of undying scholars still possess tremendous accumulated knowledge, only Geir continues with his endless experimentation on esoteric matters. Ambition for dark knowledge has waned with the imprisonment of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]].
> For a time, [[Lucimar]] the Lich-Wolf sequestered himself in the prison-library. Today, Ghasterhall acts as a headquarters for the [[Whispering Way]].
