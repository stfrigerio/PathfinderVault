> **Tumen** was once [[Osirion]]'s largest city and briefly its capital. Located 75 miles from [[Sothis]] in the eastern [[Underdunes]] far from the [[River Sphinx]], the city relied upon pure water drawn forth "by the grace of the Opaline Satrap whom the [[Radiant Pharaoh]] had favored, and in turn was favored by", which contemporary [[Osirionologist|Osirionologists]] speculate, referred to a massive aquifer or portal to the elemental planes. The city's water supply began to ebb shortly before the deaths of the [[Four Pharaohs of Ascension]], and the city descended to abandonment and an endless cycle of burial in the [[Khamsin|khamsin]] sandstorms.
> Despite its remote location, the city remains a popular destination for scholars and treasure hunters.
