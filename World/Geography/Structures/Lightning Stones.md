> According to ancient [[Garundi human ethnicity|Garundi]] legend, the **Lightning Stones** mark a battleground between [[Earth elemental|earth]] and [[Air elemental|air elementals]]. In fact, this line of twenty-foot-tall menhirs just attracts these elementals, and when they encounter each other, old grudges ensure it does not end peaceably. The menhirs run through the southern reaches of the [[Katapesh]] section of the [[Barrier Wall|Barrier Wall Mountains]] near the border with [[Nex]]. The Lightning Stones (true to their name) attract lightning from the storms common to the area.  When struck by lightning the stones glow, revealing runes and glyphs otherwise invisible to observers. This written language is unique but shares characteristics with the languages of ancient Katapesh and Nex. The writing seems to deal with how to acquire and use power for the betterment of everyone.
