**Wormwood Hall** can be found deep within the [[Lurkwood]] of north-western [[Varisia]], near the forest's border with the [[Red Mountains]].  A large manor house overrun by chocking vines, no being has set foot within the hall in living memory.  Strange, twisting runes cover its doors and walls and it is generally assumed that Wormwood is tied to the Lurkwood's strange seasons.
