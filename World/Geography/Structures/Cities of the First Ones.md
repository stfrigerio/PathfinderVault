> The **Cities of the First Ones** are abandoned spire-cities created millennia ago on the surface of the [[Planet|planet]] [[Aballon]] by a mysterious race known only as the [[First Ones]]. At least nine are known to still be scattered across the surface of the small planet.


## Description

> When the mysterious First Ones first landed on [[Aballon]], they constructed nine cities to a uniformly strange design. They are built upwards rather than outwards, with narrow streets and needle-like towers, interspersed with domes and arches. Some buildings are transparent, whilst others appear to have no means of entry.


## The Aballonians

> The [[Aballonian]] faction known as [[Those Who Wait]] preserve the cities with a religious fervour. Their rivals, [[Those Who Become]], are sometimes able to sneak into the cities in search of the lost knowledge of the First Ones, but both parties generally agree that for biological creatures to set foot in a city would be sacrilege.
