The massive, rune-covered wheel of **Gruankus** lies half-buried on the shore of the [[Varisian Gulf]].  Presumably a [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] artifact, its original purpose remains unknown, much the same as the [[Cyphergate]] in [[Riddleport]] to its east.  It was the location of the signing of the Treaty of Gruankus between the [[Pirate|pirates]] of Riddleport and the leaders of [[Magnimar]], nearly a hundred years ago, ostensibly to reduce the danger of piracy to traders travelling the [[Varisian Gulf]].
