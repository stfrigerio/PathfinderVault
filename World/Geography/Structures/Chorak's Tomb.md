> A small island in [[Lake Skotha]] on [[Varisia|Varisias]] [[Storval Plateau]], **Chorak's Tomb** is sacred to the [[Giant|giants]] of the region.  Many of them believe that it is the last outpost of a once-great giant civilization dating back thousands of years.  None of them have been able to get close enough to verify this, as all trespassers are driven away by bombardments of boulders and rune-covered ballista bolts.
