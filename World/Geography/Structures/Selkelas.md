> An enormous headless stone torso known as **Selkelas** is half-buried near the western edge of the [[Katapesh]] desert. Its size indicates that, had it been a fully detailed [[Humanoid|humanoid]] statue, it would have measured at least 20 feet in height. The name "Selkelas" is engraved on the statue's back. One of its granite hands seems to have been carved to hold a now-missing [[Weapon|weapon]], perhaps a [[Sword|sword]].
