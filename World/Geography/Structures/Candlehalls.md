> Within the blasted wasteland of [[The Furrows|the Furrows]] are found destroyed noble houses and estates. The two most notorious are **Candlehalls** and the [[House of Ensland]]. Candlehalls lies a couple of miles from the [[Kingfisher River]], but is today surrounded by the blackened trench system known as the [[Peasant Graves]]. The estate is almost certainly haunted, as [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]] lights are seen playing around the grounds and other-worldly gamblers are known to frequent the noble houses trying to entrap wanderers across the charred lands.
