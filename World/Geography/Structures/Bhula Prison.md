> **Bhula Prison**, or **Bhula Jail**, is a unique prison that sits off the coast of the [[Falling Mountains]] region and houses powerful creatures and criminals who would profane the rest of [[Vudra|Vudras]] holy soil with their mere presence. The prison is located along a particularly desolate stretch of shoreline with no other signs of civilization. Bhula Prison itself is a massive structure but is not the first prison built along this bleak coastline, all of the others fell when the prisoners were afflicted with horrifying [[Psychic magic|psychic]] [[Disease|maladies]].
