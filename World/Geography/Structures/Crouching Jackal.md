> Located in northern [[Katapesh]], the **Crouching Jackal** is a huge statue nearly seventy foot tall that appears to be of a jackal although the body looks more like that of a cat (or possibly an [[Osirion|osirion]] sphinx) but the head has the up-right, pointed ear of a jackal, it also has a jackal's bushy tail. No one knows who built the Crouching Jackal or why though some rumours claim if a person sleeps in front of it then he will be transformed into a [[Jackalwere|jackalwere]]. Other theories include the Crouching Jackal being an hollow, unopened treasure vault or a vast construct used in ancient wars as a terrifying weapon. Many also believe that it is a sister statue to the lizard like [[Creeping Watcher]] of the [[Vargas Swamp]]. Regardless of its original purpose the Crouching Jackal can be seen for miles around and is used as a convenient land mark by local travellers.
