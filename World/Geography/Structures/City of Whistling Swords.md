> The **City of Whistling Swords** is the name given to the ruined first capital of the [[Lung Wa|pre-Lung Wa]] nation of [[Kwanlai]] in [[Tian Xia]]. This lost city lies in the eastern foothills of Kwanlai, mostly ignored by its [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]] inhabitants. Still, it is a great draw for outsiders and [[Adventurer|adventurers]] looking to loot the city's supposedly untouched armouries. Unfortunately, this is no easy task as the city is now infested with [[Ratfolk|ratfolk]], [[Oni|oni]], and other foul spirits, all supposedly led by a hateful [[Underworld dragon|underworld dragon]] exiled to the surface world he so despises.
