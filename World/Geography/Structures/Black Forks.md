> **Black Forks** is an abandoned ancient monastery in the southern [[Verduran Forest]]. It is built around a strange, deep pool of black water, features strangely bestial architecture and sculpture, and is named for the two-headed forks once used in rites of self-torture by its long-deceased order.


## History

> The pool at the center of the site long predates the structure, and pictographs on clay tablets depict a slime-covered orb of a creature named the Dreamer in the Depths that was said—though never witnessed in modern times—to dwell in the pool. The tablets also depicted a strange process of hanging over the pool until survivors went mute and gained mystical insight.
> The pool was re-discovered by academics at some point prior to 2715 AR, who then built the monastery and began their own excruciating self-torture rituals. Late in [['24 AR]], hordes of [[Goblin|goblins]] displaced by violence in the northern Verduran Forest killed the monastery's [[Monk|monks]] while they hung from its ceiling over the pool. After the goblins dumped the monks' bodies into the pool, the Dreamer in the Depths emerged and began to attack [[Taldan]] farms in the [[Carpenden Plains]].
> Taldan soldiers drove the creature back with a [[Magic item|magical spear]] tipped with a [[Rune|rune]]-covered blade, though none of the soldiers returned, the spear was lost, and the Dreamer was never heard from again.


## Recent activity

> The temple is mostly ignored by locals, though some travelers still stop to examine its unusual architecture, [[Druid|druids]] hold fiery [[Ritual|rituals]] on its roof, and a more mysterious group of cowled visitors known only as the Tenders wander the halls of Black Forks under a [[Moon Golarion|new moon]] performing silent ritual gestures of their own.
