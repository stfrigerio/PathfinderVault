> The **Steps of the Agate King** is a massive pyramid located within the depths of the [[Sparadyn Jungle]] in central [[Katapesh]]. The pyramid lists gently to the west having sunk into the earth. The pyramid is made of large blocks streaked with red and golden agate that make it dazzling to look upon.
> It is generally accepted by all the citizens of Katapesh, despite a lack of scholarly evidence, that the Steps of the Agate King bar the way to the underground tomb of the legendary Agate King. People also accept that he took all the trappings of life with him when he was buried, and that somewhere buried beneath is a king's fortune. 
> While there is an underground section to the site, it lies completely empty, perhaps stripped bare of its former wealth, or perhaps never having any in the first place. Regardless, every year a few hardy souls visit the Steps of the Agate King desperately looking for the rumoured treasure-filled tomb layer.
