> [[Angus Amberleg]] was a notorious and highly successful pirate who ravaged the [[Inner Sea]] and plundered a hundred ships. His treasure is believed to lie in a stone crypt somewhere in the interior of [[Mediogalti Island]]. Angus's crypt is arguably the most famous of the region's numerous pirate crypts.
> According to legend, the crypt was buily by slaves, who became a permanent part of the construction by being buried alive once the work was finished. It is believed that their [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] now guard the treasure – along with the undead pirate himself.
> The treasure itself is said to include ancient artefacts and large jewels – some as large as the fist of an [[Ogre|ogre]].
