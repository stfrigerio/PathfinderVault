> The **Nameless Spires** are the ruins of an ancient city located on [[Golarion|Golarions]] geographical North Pole, in the [[Crown of the World]]. Some scholars believe that their creation dates back to the formation of [[Golarion]] itself.



## Description

> The ruins' buildings are carved of dark stone and [[Metal|metal]] and laid out in stellar patterns linked by stone roads. Six spires, each reaching up to 2,000 feet in height, are evenly spaced in the outskirts of the city. A black liquid has undermined the foundations of certain buildings and erupted from subterranean cysts leagues away from the city.
> Progressions of [[Will-o'-wisp|will-o-wisps]], burning alien constellations, swirl around the Nameless Spires but never actually enter the city. It is speculated that they feed upon the terror of the ancient dead, or upon the emotions of an alien thing lurking underground.


## Erutaki belief

> [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] pilgrims sometimes approach, but rarely enter, the city during their vision quests. Few have entered the ruined city and returned, and those who do tell of empty streets, eerily beautiful buildings, strange [[Plant|plants]], and creatures made of metal and ice, but never dare return for a second time. Erutaki [[Psychic|psychics]] do travel to the Nameless Spires, though only in their dreams, due to a special link to the Spires they claim to uphold.


## History

> Important for psychic scholars, the *Infinity Scroll* was found by a [[Varisian]] team exploring the Nameless Spires in [[4681 AR]] who took it to [[Riddleport]] for study. Its contents and provenance generated great academic debate across Golarion but, unfortunately, the scroll disappeared during a riot in around [[4690 AR]].
