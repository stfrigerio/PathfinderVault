> **Gormuz** was an ancient [[Ninshabur|Ninshaburian]] city in central [[Casmaron]] that was believed to have been holy to the [[God|goddess]] [[Sarenrae]]. It was destroyed by the goddess in [[-3923 AR]], and in its place, the infamous [[Pit of Gormuz]] can now be found.


## History

> During the [[Age of Creation]], an alliance of [[Deity|gods]] defeated [[Rovagug]], imprisoning him within the [[Demiplane|demiplane]] known as the [[Dead Vault]] far beneath [[Golarion|Golarions]] surface. The goddess Sarenrae repaired the gash in the earth into which the Rough Beast had been flung, and commanded her followers to avoid the smooth scar that remained. Her faithful living in nearby Ninshabur misinterpreted her instructions, however, and instead flocked to the area, eventually founding the settlement of Gormuz there. Believing Gormuz to be a holy city of Sarenrae, people from all over Casmaron flocked there for millennia, but were slowly corrupted by the imprisoned god Rovagug's dreams. Sarenrae continued sending portents and visions to her faithful in Gormuz during this period, warning them of Rovagug's growing influence among them, but these were ignored or misinterpreted. She finally sent her [[Herald|herald]] [[Kohal]] to the people of Gormuz in [[-3923 AR]] with a final offer of redemption, but they had been so corrupted that they destroyed him instead. In great wrath, Sarenrae smote Gormuz with her [[Scimitar|scimitar]], destroying the city completely. This act created an enormous rent in the earth that eventually became known as the [[Pit of Gormuz]], which let loose the [[Spawn of Rovagug]] to destroy Ninshabur.


### Aftermath

> Horrified by the destruction she had caused in Gormuz and guilt-ridden by the Spawn of Rovagug's destruction she had unintentionally unleashed, Sarenrae reached out to a female survivor of Gormuz's destruction. The goddess imbued her with divine powers, asking her to guide her fellow survivors toward goodness and redemption. Even though this woman's name has been lost to history, her example lead to a [[Cleric|clerical]] tradition of Sarenrae's followers known as the [[Blossoming light|blossoming light]].
