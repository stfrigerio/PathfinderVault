> It is believed that the [[World/Items & Equipment/Animals and Gears/Dinosaur|dinosaurs]] of [[Mediogalti]] are led by instinct to a specific site within the jungle interior when it is time for them to die. This **dinosaur graveyard** is said to  contain countless dinosaur bones, which supposedly animate and attack intruders. Some legends claim that all of the island's unclaimed buried treasure has somehow found its way to the graveyard, where it lies among the bones.
