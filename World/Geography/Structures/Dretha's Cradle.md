> **Dretha's Cradle** serves as the home and [[Laboratory|laboratory]] for the [[Orc|orc]] [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemist]] known as [[Mother Chot]] and her apprentices.


## Geography

> It is located in the [[Algid Wastes]] of the northern [[Hold of Belkzen]], near the border with the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]].


## Structure and use

> Dretha's Cradle also serves as a mixture of fortress, breeding yard, and prison for the monsters created within. Here, Mother Chot uses the [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]] techniques she tortured out of her former [[Drow|drow]] master [[Xilganni Parastric]] to create terrifying monstrosities and [[Undead|undead]] creations.
> She is not alone in this endeavour, as Dretha's Cradle now serves as home for dozens of apprentices and breeders each conducting their own foul experiments. The [[Mangled Limb tribe]] drags [[Slave|slaves]] and captured megafauna to Dretha's Cradle to be transformed into warbeasts, half-living warmachines, and [[Undead|undead]] abominations.
> These creatures are then auctioned off to the orc tribes and other sinister visitors three times a year. The beasts can fetch thousands of [[Gold piece|gold pieces]] each, or are sometimes traded for rare [[Alchemy|alchemical]] concoctions. Mother Chot herself is known for her creation of [[Oronci|oronci]] from orc slaves and necrocrafts made of discarded flesh.
> She roams Dretha's Cradle carried by a unique [[Flesh golem|flesh golem]] that includes parts of her long-dead master Xilganni Parastric.
