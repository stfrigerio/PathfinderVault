> **Dortrot Ranch** is a large [[Horse|horse]] ranch located on the plains of the eastern [[Gravelands]] just south of the [[Path River]]. The family of the owner, [[Chap Dortrot|Chap Old Man Dortrot]], has been raising both draft and warhorses there for 11 generations.


## Horses

> The Dortrot family primarily raises Lastwall palfreys (known for their smooth, ambling gait), [[Taldor jennet|Taldor jennets]] (whose calm disposition is well known), [[Dort charger|Dort chargers]] (the second-most popular breed of Lastwall warhorses), as well as mixed-breeds to be used as work horses. The family patriarch, "Old Man" Dortrot, carefully manages the herd, which rarely is larger than 2,000 head, and regularly rotates his pastures.


## Recent history

> In the last few years, the ranch has been plagued by mites, both of the [[Vermin|verminous]] and [[Mite|fey]] variety, and has been looking for assistance for protecting its herd.
> Another concern is the infestation of [[Moroi|moroi]] near [[Hammer Rock]] as Dortrot Ranch is the closest place the [[Vampire|vampires]] could feed. The [[Nosferatu|nosferatu]] Ramoska Arkminos heard of this and is taking action to support the Ranch due to his assessment about the lack of their ability to withstand an attack from a coven of vampires: Dortrot keeps only a single [[Pharasmin]] priest on the premises. It is not clear why Arkiminos would want to help Dortrot, and it is more likely he wants to imprison the moroi for his own purposes.
