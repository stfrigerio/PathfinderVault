> **Arabrecht** is a mysterious site located in the southernmost tip of [[Kyonin|Kyonins]] [[Fierani Forest]], well within the [[Tanglebriar]], the domain of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Treerazer]].



## History

> During the [[Age of Legend]], Arabrecht was the handsome manor home of the [[Aelthian|Archmage Aelthian]], one of the most powerful [[Elf|elven]] [[Wizard|wizards]] who ever lived. When the government of [[Kyonin]] ordered the mass evacuation of all of [[Golarion|Golarions]] elves through the [[Sovyrian Stone]] in order to avoid the doom of [[Earthfall]], Aelthian ignored their pleas, trusting in his own [[Magic|magical]] wards to protect him. His confidence seems to have been justified, as Aelthian survived the cataclysm and continued his magical research for thousands of years thereafter, eventually even unlocking the secret of eternal life.


### Fight Against Treerazer

> When the elves returned from their refuge in [[Sovyrian]] in [[2632 AR]] and found much of their country under Treerazer's sway, they pleaded with Aelthian for assistance. The Archmage, already annoyed at the [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]] audacity, agreed and crafted a [[Spell|spell]] of incredible power that would banish Treerazer and all of his minions at once. Even though many demons perished as the spell's energies were released, something terrible went wrong. The elves attempted to contact Aelthian, but received no reply. When they traveled to Arabrecht, all they found there was a grassy, concave clearing carved into the ground with no sign of the manor or the archmage. Floating above the center of the crater was a single anthracite ball that seemed to pull everything towards it. A low, whistling wind blew constantly inward toward the ball from all sides, as if the sphere was drawing in all matter towards it.
