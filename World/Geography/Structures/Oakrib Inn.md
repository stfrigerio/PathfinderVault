**Oakrib Inn** is the site where the [[Silver Ravens]] negotiated the details of [[Ravounel]]'s secession from [[Cheliax]]. This large inn near the head of the [[Yolubilis River]] was once a popular stopping point for those traveling through the [[Menador Gap]]. Since the destruction of [[Menador Keep]] and the closure of the Gap, the inn's owner Olradi Ormovor has reinvented it as a luxury tourist destination and historical heritage site, complete with dramatic reenactments of the tense negotiations.
