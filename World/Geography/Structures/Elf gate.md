 An elf gate.
> **Elf gates**, or ***aiudara*** as the [[Elf|elves]] call them, are [[Magic|magical]] local transportation devices located in [[Kyonin]], across [[Golarion]], and on [[Castrovel]]. Some elves only use the term *aiudara*, as they consider the term "elf gate" to be vulgar. Elf gates appear as sculpted stone arches, and when activated instantly transport anyone to another specific elf gate.



## History

> The *aiudara* network is believed to have been created during the [[Age of Legend]] by the legendary elven hero [[Candlaron the Sculptor]], beginning with the portals known as [[Alseta's Ring|Alsetas Ring]]. The secret of their creation was lost when Candlaron vanished through a mysterious archway. He also created the [[Sovyrian Stone]], and used the [[World/Items & Equipment/Artifacts/Artifact|artifact]] to power all of the elf gates.


## Travel

> Elf gates are activated using a key, which can be a physical token but might also be a password, piece of [[Music|music]], [[Spell|spell]], or stellar conjunction. Some gates have multiple keys, each linked to another specific elf gate. Most elf gate keys have been forgotten over the millennia, and, therefore, some elf gates have been abandoned.
> Only the first traveller in a group needs a key; the rest can follow to the same destination. Travel through an elf gate is instantaneous, and because of this, elf gates represent a significant part of the elves' historic power, as it allows them to move people and goods with incredible speeds across vast distances.
> A gate can lead to another specific elf gate, or to a hub that connects several possible locations. The system of elf gates is sometimes referred to as the **aiudara network**.
> Elf gates do not allow travel between [[Planet|planets]] or [[Plane|planes]], unlike the incredibly ancient or naturally occurring [[Portal|portals]] that they resemble. These interplanetary portals predate the elves, and perhaps even all life in the [[Solar system|solar system]].


## Religious significance

 [[Alseta]] observes [[Elves|elves]] passing through an elf gate.
***Main article: [[Alseta]]***
> The elves consider [[Alseta]], [[God|goddess]] of doorways, to be the unofficial patron deity of elf gates.


## Known elf gates

> The following *aiudara* are known to exist on Golarion, although not all of them continue to be active to this day:

> - [[Alseta's Ring|Alsetas Ring]], the first set of gates created by Candlaron, located beneath [[Citadel Altaerein]] in [[Isger]], which consists of:
[[Lotusgate]], a currently non-functional gate which exits in [[Iadara]]
[[Huntergate]], which exits near [[Akrivel]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]
[[Dreamgate]], which exits in Ravounel; Dreamgate was used millennia ago by elves who would later settle in the ocean and become the first [[Aquatic elves|aquatic elves]]
[[Jewelgate]], in [[Kovlar]] under the [[Five Kings Mountains]]
[[Duskgate]], near the town of [[Finderplain]] in [[Katapesh]]
[[Vengegate]], on [[Hermea]], which was used by the elves who would go on to become the [[Mordant Spire elves]] to reach their destination
