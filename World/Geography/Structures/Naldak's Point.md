> **Naldak's Point** is an abandoned [[Dwarf|dwarven]] town near [[Dalun]]. The town was founded around [[1600 AR]] by King Gutheran's youngest son, [[Naldak]], after they fled [[Jormurdun]]. They traded their creations to the nearby [[Ulfen]] people, and lived in Naldak's Point until [[3313 AR]]. In this year, the armies of [[Baba Yaga]] invaded what would later form the kingdom of [[Irrisen]] but, at the same time, the [[Tian]] [[Sorcerer|sorceress]] [[Hao Jin]] approached the dwarves and offered them shelter. They refused at first, but Hao Jin returned every night with the same offer. At the fourth night, when the armies of Baba Yaga massed on the horizon, the dwarves accepted Hao Jin's offer. The sorceress transported them to her personal demiplane, the [[Hao Jin Tapestry]].
