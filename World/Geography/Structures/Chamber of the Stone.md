> The **Chamber of the Stone** is an until recently hidden underground room beneath the [[House of the Immortal Son]] in the [[Taldor|Taldan]] port city of [[Oppara]]. It was sealed over 6,000 years ago by [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] immigrants to Taldor. They were hoping to prevent others from accessing the [[Necromancy|necromantic]] [[World/Items & Equipment/Artifacts/Artifact|artifact]] known as the *[[Zyphus Stone]]*, which they hid within the chamber. The [[Magic item|magic item]] lay undisturbed for millennia until it was unearthed by [[Fel Bustrani]], a [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Zyphus]], and the [[Pathfinder]] [[Bodriggan Wuthers]] in [[4708 AR]].
