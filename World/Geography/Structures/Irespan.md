> The **Irespan**, sometimes called the **Giant's Bridge**, is the largest and most impressive monument in all of [[Magnimar]] and overshadows the city's poorest district known as [[Underbridge]]. The Irespan is actually the remains of an enormous bridge that stretches into the [[Varisian Gulf]], standing over 300 feet above the sea and over 100 feet wide. It is, like most of the monuments that dot the [[Varisia|Varisian]] landscape, a remnant of ancient [[Thassilon]].


## History

> The Irespan is one of the cyclopean monuments of ancient Thassilon, built with the labor of [[Slavery|enslaved]] [[Rune giant|rune]] and [[Stone giant|stone giants]].
> Nearly 10,000 years before the [[4608 AR|founding of Magnimar]], the Irespan served as the main travel route through the mountainous realm of [[Bakrakhan]]. The Irespan used to stretch all the way from the capital city of [[Xin-Bakrakhan]], the strange monument now known as [[Hollow Mountain]], some 200 miles northwest. When [[Earthfall]]—the cataclysm that heralded the end of the Thassilonian empire—struck, most of the Irespan collapsed. Now all that remains are the end of the Irespan in Magnimar and a few crumbling stretches that speckle the entrance to the Varisian Gulf.
> In [[4584 AR]], [[Alcaydian Indros]], a [[Paladin|paladin]] of the [[Deity|deity]] [[Aroden]], led a small exploratory expedition into the wilds of the then unknown reaches of western Varisia. There he discovered the massive Thassilonian ruin of the Irespan, and while camping on the beach he and his companions (known as the [[Wardens of the Eye]]) were attacked by the [[Vydrarch]], a massive sea monster. Despite the fact that he was fully [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armored]], Indros strode into the waves to battle the monster. He emerged minutes later, having saved the lives of his followers, and declared the place would thenceforth be named Magnimar, or "Stone of the Sea".
> The [[Eyes of the Hawk]] adventuring group famously defended [[Magnimar]] from [[Shriezyx|shriezyx]] freed from the Irespan in [[4623 AR]].
