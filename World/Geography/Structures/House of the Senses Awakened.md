> The **House of the Senses Awakened** was the decadent project of [[Cydonus III|Grand Prince Cydonus III]], the ruler of [[Taldor]] who was so profligate in his spending that, during a mere five-year reign ([[4077 AR|4077]]â€“[[4081 AR]]), he nearly bankrupted the entire country. Cydonus spent his life wracked with anxiety over the possibility of an attack from neighbouring [[Qadira]]. He dealt with this fear by indulging his every whim and the culmination of this was the House of the Senses Awakened. A maze-like pleasure palace located in the wilds of the [[Porthmos Gap]], Cydonus III effectively moved Taldor's capital from [[Oppara]] to this lavish pleasure ground during his reign. This included his harem of lovers and one in particular, Origen Sarlu, was especially fond of the Grand Prince.
> In the wake of the [[Even-Tongued Conquest]], Grand Prince Cydonus III was [[Poison|poisoned]] by a Qadiran agent (later identified by the Ballingar Accord). After the Grand Prince's death, Origen Sarlu absconded with his body and sealed himself, the Grand Prince's body, and a significant portion of Taldor's wealth within the House of the Senses Awakened, turning the complex into a trap-riddled hazard that has remained impenetrable to this day. Origen Sarlu still dwells within, having become a powerful form of [[Undead|undead]] known as a [[Nemhain|nemhain]] and the house is protected by an array of other undead, including [[Spectre|spectres]], [[Wight|wights]], and [[Wraith|wraiths]], as well as ancient [[Stone golem|stone golems]].
