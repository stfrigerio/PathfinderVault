> The **Androsphinx of Zukebri** is an ancient monument in [[Osirion|Osirions]] [[Underdunes]] in the form of a [[Sphinx|sphinx]], with a bronze-cast face of an unknown [[Pharaoh|pharaoh]] and massive [[Ruby|ruby]] and sapphire adornments. Powerful [[Magic|magic]] protects it from the Underdunes' constantly shifting sands and leaves it at the center of a perfectly circular crater of flat ground, and any who approach it are assaulted by its piercing [[Telepathic|telepathic]] screams similar to [[Mind quakes|mind quakes]]. The monument also seems to weep tears of unknown black fluid.
> A cult of [[Lamashtu]], comprised of the rare people unaffected by its telepathic attacks and possibly inspired by another Lamashtan cult near [[Eto]], worships the monument and is known to sacrifice travelers who draw near. [[Occult]] researchers have attempted to link the androsphinx to the 11 gifts reportedly given to the [[Four Pharaohs]] by "Emissaries" from [[Aucturn]] in the *[[Calosian Manuscript]]*.
