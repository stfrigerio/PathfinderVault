> The **Bone Garden** is an unusual [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]] cemetery located in the foothills of the [[Brazen Peaks]] along [[Osirion|Osirions]] southern border with [[Katapesh]]. Firstly, it is unusual, because most gnolls do not bury their dead, preferring to leave them to be picked apart by [[Hyena|hyenas]] and vultures. Secondly, the Bone Garden is unusual because those who are interred here do not stay in the ground for long. This is because the graveyard is tended by gnoll priestesses of [[Urgathoa]], who are happy to accept the bodies of any fallen gnoll brought here by its tribe-mates and convert them to [[Skeleton|skeletons]] and [[Zombie|zombies]]. The devotees of the Pallid Princess have amassed a sizable army of the [[Undead|undead]], which they trade with the Pharaoh of Fangs to augment his troops.
