> **Ranage's Circle** is a tight-knit circle of massive cypress trees, in the heart of the [[Mwangi Jungle]]. It was planted 1,000 years ago by [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of the [[Jambala Jaeg]] tribe. The ancient [[Magic|magic]] of the circle protects against [[Evil|evil]] creatures and hostile wildlife, making it a safe resting place for those who know how to find it. The tree at the centre of the circle has a split trunk, which is wrapped tightly around a black stone. According to legend, the stone is the prison of Golokango, who is either a [[Demon|demon]] or a powerful jungle spirit. The central tree is barely alive, and according to the legend is a [[Arboreal regent|arboreal regent]] druid who sacrificed most of its life force to seal the prison. Some tales even claim that the guardian is a sibling of [[Dimari-Diji]], the incredibly ancient arboreal regent of [[Osibu]].
