Nation: Mwangi Expanse

> The ruined city of **Liclac** was once a thriving settlement of the now-extinct nation of [[Rastel]]. The ruins stand upon the banks of the Upper Korir River on the edge of the [[Screaming Jungle]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. Just as with all other ruins of the Rastel culture, Liclac shows signs of fire, conflict, and cannibalism.
