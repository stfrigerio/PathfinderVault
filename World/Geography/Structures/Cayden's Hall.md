 A rough map of Cayden's Hall
> **Cayden's Hall** in the [[Ascendant Court]] district of [[Absalom]] is a large, boisterous meadhall and temple of [[Cayden Cailean]], built of wood as was the original meadhall from which Cayden set out to take the [[Test of the Starstone]]. Due to the [[Alcohol|drunken]] revelry, religious bonfires, and consequent accidents, this is the fourteenth temple built on the current site near a large fountain, which is itself at least the fourth site to house Cayden's temple.
> Efforts are made by the local priests and the house guards to quell any serious fights and extinguish uncontrolled fires, despite the fact that they are often as inebriated as the patrons who frequent the hall. Aside from simple drinks and food, the hall also boasts a mid-sized speaking hall, intended for both religious proclamations and general entertainment.
> Ruled by [[Saphira|High Priestess Saphira]], the Lady of Intemperance, it is not merely a place to get drunk, but also a gathering-hall for [[Adventurer|adventurers]] to meet and plot expeditions, rebellions, and exploits of all kinds.
