Built thousands of years ago by the [[Slavery|enslaved]] [[Giant|giants]] of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] empire, the **Storval Stairs** are a set of stair-like tiers carved into the side of the western [[Storval Rise]], then part of [[Shalast]]. Although sized for a gigantic creature, they are by far the easiest way to cross the Rise west of the [[Iron Peaks]]. It is not uncommon for the Storval Rise to reach heights of over 1,000 feet in many places, sharply delineating the fertile lowlands from the barren scrub land of the [[Storval Plateau]]. At the Storval Stairs, however, the Rise is only 400 feet in height with [[Human|human]]-sized steps and ramps cut into the gargantuan ones, making the passage even easier. Immense statues of the [[Runelord|runelord]] [[Karzoug]] flank the stairs, although the southern-most one is beginning to finally crumble due to erosion.


## Recent history

![[Storval_King.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Formoch, the [[Hill giant|hill giant]] "King of the Storval Stairs"
> In [[4707 AR]], the [[Stone giant|stone giant]] leader [[Mokmurian]] sent a band of his followers to clean up the stairs and hold them as a route for his invasion of [[Varisia]]. After his defeat, the Stairs were abandoned and presumably retaken by members of the [[ShoantiTribes of the Shoanti|Shoanti Hawk Clan]], who have patrolled the Stairs for generations.
> A flight of [[Harpy|harpies]] led by the harpy queen Lareecan later claimed the Stairs for two years, but were themselves ousted by a [[Hill giant|hill giant]] clan led by Formoch, the self-proclaimed "King of the Storval Stairs." With the strategic Stairs under their control, Formoch's clan charged exorbitant tolls to travellers, which eventually drew the ire of the [[Pathfinder Society]] for disrupting their expeditions into [[Xin-Shalast]].
