> A truly unique building along the wealthy water's edge district of [[Silver Shore]] in [[Magnimar]], the **Aquaretum** serves as a guide to the underwater world of the [[Varisian Gulf]]. The Aquaretum is somewhere between a museum, a trophy room and an aquarium combining stuffed trophies, regular exhibits and live creatures from the depths of the Varisian Gulf. The Aquaretum is run by the eccentric [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Gnome|gnome]] [[Nireed Wadincoast]], who is a well renowned expert on life below the waves, although few locals take his claim of "ancient cities beneath the waves" too seriously.
