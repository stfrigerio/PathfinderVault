> The ruins of the city of **Domora** sit on the [[Sarkorian Steppe]] of the [[Sarkoris Scar]], at the edge of a dried lakebed that once was the famous [[Sarkoris|Sarkorian]] [[Hume's Pool|Humes Pool]].


## History

> Founded by [[Domora Hume]] in [[4170 AR]], Domora eventually became the largest city in the Sarkorian Steppe. The city grew into a center of [[Animal|animal]] husbandry and [[Horse|horse]] breeding, and served as a major hub for trapping and hunting. In [[4172 AR]], Hume conjured a dreadful creature from the lake south of town to defend the city from a large force of [[Mammoth rider|Mammoth Lord raiders]]. This creature was a powerful [[Eidolon|eidolon]] named [[Dyzad]] drawn from the [[Plane of Water]]. With Dyzad's aid, Hume repulsed the [[Barbarian|barbarians]] and saved his people. Thereafter, the amazed and grateful people of Domora began worshiping their savior eidolon as a [[God|god]] and Hume became the first of Sarkoris' [[God caller|god callers]]. Even after Hume's death, the people of Domora continued to worship Dyzad and Hume's descendants summoned aspects of the eidolon in times of need.


## Domora today

> Today, Domora is abandoned, and Hume's Pool is just another [[Sun|sun]]-baked lakebed. Barbarian raiders and [[Demon|demons]] often use Domora's crumbling buildings as cover. It is said that somewhere deep beneath Domora's ruins, in the still-flooded sewers and cisterns, Dyzad and her spawn yet dwell, continuing to protect the greatest of the Hume family's treasures.
