> **Nalt's Island** is located between [[Bag Island]] and [[Shark Island]] in the [[Shackles]]. The island bears the name of the notorious pirate [[Nalt Tarbrow]] who built his fortress, the [[Eel's Skull|Eels Skull]], at the edge of a sheer cliff on the northern expanse of the island's eastern shore. It is said that there are [[Ghol-Gan]] dungeons beneath the fortress, but Tarbrow destroyed the fortress in a fit of madness, nearly 100 years ago, and no entrance to any dungeon has been found in the ruins.
> The island's resident [[Giant|giants]] avoid the [[Lake of Dead Dreams]] and the Ghol-Gan ruins around it. They say the lake is haunted by [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] and those who drink from the lake suffer thereafter from terrible nightmares. [[Pterosaur|Pterosaurs]] roost in the hillsides near the lake, hunting on any creatures that pass too close to their nests.
> A tribe of [[Vegepygmy|vegepygmy]] natives live on the barrier island of [[Redbow]]. They use to launch attacks at any ships that dare pass through the straits between Redbow and Nalt's Island. Their strategy is to force unwary ships toward the whirling vortex beneath [[Whirlpool Rush]] on the straits' far side. The vegepygmies make their characteristic gleeful clicking noises during their assault.
