> The **Lucrehold** is an island off the coast of [[Port Peril]] in the [[Shackles]] where the Hurricane King [[Kerdak Bonefist]] makes his fortress home. The imposing structure, known as [[Fort Hazard]], stands on the bluffs above the city, overlooking the lighthouse known as [[Besmara's Beacon|Besmaras Beacon]].
> Its architecture is similar in style to that of the [[Sargava|Sargavan]] capital of [[Anthusis|Eleder]]. It is said to contain numerous chambers filled with the Hurricane King's ill-gotten gains.
