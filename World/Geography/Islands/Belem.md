> **Belem** is the largest island in the [[Tengah Pulu]] region of the [[Minata|Wandering Isles of Minata]]. Belem is famous for its hidden coves, treacherous shores, and being home to the largest collection of [[Pirate|pirates]] in all Minata. While calling these pirates a kingdom, or even particularly organised, is laughable, they do boast a small city, [[Waunomani]], which has a large amount of political clout across the islands.
