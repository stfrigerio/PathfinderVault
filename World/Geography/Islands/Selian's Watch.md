> **Selian's Watch** is a craggy, desolate island off the southern coast of [[Andoran]], near [[Aspo Bay]].
> The island contains a lighthouse and an abandoned [[Chelish Navy|Chelish naval]] base off the southern coast of [[Andoran]]. A jetty protects a cove off the island's southeastern side, in which a dozen Chelish [[Ship|warships]] of Commander Camdin Anduvas rest, destroyed by Andoran's [[Gray Corsairs]] soon after Andoran gained independence.
> The island is dominated by [[Lacedon|lacedons]] after an ill-fated escape effort by some of the Chelish sailors, including Anduvas's advisor Ilraccia, resulted in the survivors contracting [[Ghoul fever|ghoul fever]] from a lacedon attack. Ilraccia was turned into a lacedon but retained her powers as a [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]], and she uses them—and the reactivated lighthouse—to lure others to the island to be converted into lacedons themselves.
