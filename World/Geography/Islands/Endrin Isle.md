*For a complete history of both Fort Korvosa and Korvosa, please see the [[Korvosa|main article]] on the city.*
> **Endrin Isle** is an island in [[Varisia]] at the mouth of the [[Jeggare River]] and part of the city of [[Korvosa]]. It rises from sea level to an escarpment of 200 meters on its northern seaward side. It was named in honor of [[Waydon Endrin]], a sergeant-at-arms in the [[Chelish Navy|Chelish Marines]] who was the highest ranking survivor of the force that landed on the island by [[Montlarion Jeggare]] in [[4407 AR]], before he left to lead an expedition up the river that now bears his name. It is the location of the original [[Fort Korvosa]] and one of the poorer districts of the city, [[Old Korvosa]], now covers the entirety of the island.
