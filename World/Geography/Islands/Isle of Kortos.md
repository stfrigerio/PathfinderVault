![[Aeon_Tower.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 An [[Aeon Tower]] on the Isle of Kortos.
> The **Isle of Kortos** (meaning **Starstone Isle** in the [[Dead languages of GolarionAzlanti|Azlanti language]]) sits prominently in the center of the [[Inner Sea]] and hosts [[Absalom]], [[Golarion|Golarions]] largest city.



## Geography

> While the metropolis itself does not occupy the entire landmass, the remaining land is considered among the city-state's holdings, including the smaller settlements of [[Diobel]] and [[Escadar]]. The tiny village of [[Pier's End|Piers End]] sits on the northern coast of the island and caters to travelers trekking to Escadar, while the small port town of [[Otari]] is located on the southern coast about halfway between Diobel and Absalom.
> Much of the unpopulated land surrounding Absalom is filled with ruined siege engines and battlements from the countless assaults on the city's impenetrable walls, and has come to be known as the [[Cairnlands]]. The [[Kortos Mounts]] rear out of the center of the island, forested in their lower reaches but barren and icy at their peaks. Its highest peak is [[Arazlant Mox]] at over 26,000 feet in height.
> From directly north to far to the west of the city of Absalom, stretches a vast, primordial woodland known as the [[Immenwood]]. The wood harvested from these lands fuels the logging trade that helps sustain the Isle. Centered within the woods themselves is the town of [[Meravon]], where the logging trade is centered.
> Just to the north of the Isle of Kortos lies the much smaller [[Isle of Erran]], home to the navy town of Escadar. The tiny island of [[Pariol Island|Pariol]], owned by the wealthy and influential [[Blakros family]], lies south of it.


## Inhabitants

> Tribes of [[Minotaur|minotaurs]], [[Harpy|harpies]], and [[Centaur|centaurs]] occupy the untamed wilderness beyond the Isle's civilized shores, constantly battling one another and intruders to their territory, and sometimes causing problems for caravans from the western port of Diobel to the markets of Absalom.
> Horses are not present on the Isle of Kortos as the centaurs regard them as invaders and the harpies like to eat them, so most farmers, merchants, and nobles on the island use camels or [[Axe beak|axe beaks]]. Rumor holds that there is a race of winged camels on the north end of the island, but these creatures must be exceedingly rare.


## History

> [[Aroden]] raised the isle from the sea floor in [[1 AR]] in the act of bringing the *[[Starstone]]* from its resting place in the Inner Sea's depths.
