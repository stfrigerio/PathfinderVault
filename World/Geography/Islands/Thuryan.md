> **Thuryan** is a large island in the [[Arcadian Ocean]] just off the western coast of [[Cheliax]]. It is part of an archipelago that also includes the islands of [[Bog Rock]], [[Shardstone]], [[Warlock Island]], and [[Wolf's Tooth|Wolfs Tooth]]. A small, unnamed island just west of Thuryan was once the home of the Hrannis, a family of [[Storm giant|storm giants]] who gave up their holdings after Cheliax fell under the [[Infernal|infernal]] ministrations of [[House Thrune]].
