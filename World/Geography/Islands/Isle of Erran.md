The Isle of Erran, north of the [[Isle of Kortos]].
> The **Isle of Erran** is a small island off the northern coast of the [[Isle of Kortos]], which hosts the navy of [[Absalom]] at the port of [[Escadar]].



## History

Countless stories are told about it, and it is clear that it has yet to give up many of its secrets.


## Geography

> The northern part of the island is covered in forests that contain hundreds of tombs and other burial sites unrelated to Aroden's worship. Absalom's Navy often comes across them while it harvests lumber to build its [[Ship|ships]], and sends [[Adventurer|adventurers]] to investigate these discoveries.
