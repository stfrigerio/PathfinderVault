> **Andobar Island** is one of the few islands that was not connected with mainland [[Vudra]] when the waters of the [[Obari Ocean]] receded forming the land bridge known as [[Open Bridge]]. Still considered part of the Open Bridge region, rather than swarming with the [[Sorted Traits/creature/aberration|aberrations]] that infest much of the rest of the region, Andobar Island instead belongs to the [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]]. These serpentfolk follow an unknown malicious entity and have recently begun erecting ominous ziggurats across the island.
