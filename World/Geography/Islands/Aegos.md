Aegos, at center.
> 
**Aegos** is the larger and more northerly island of the two main islands comprising the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Broken Bay]], the other island being [[Orthost]]. On Aegos are found the capital, [[Bildt]], which boasts the only natural harbour in the region, and the whaling town of [[Skjoldmur]], which also serves as a gateway to Orthost. Aegos is surrounded by several smaller uninhabited rocky isles.
> Aegos is renowned for stormy weather that makes its treacherous coast dangerous to travel. Its coastline is strewn with shipwrecks that lead to Broken Bay being given its name. Aegos is the most civilised of the islands of Broken Bay but its people are tough and warlike, even viewing their fellow countrymen as weak and cowardly. Most people on Aegos live on either the southern or eastern shores. The centre and northwest of the island are cold, forsaken lands roamed mainly by [[Wolf|wolves]], [[Worg|worgs]], and [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]].
