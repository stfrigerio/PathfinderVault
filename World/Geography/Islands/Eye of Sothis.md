*For another meaning of "Eye of Sothis", please see [[Eyes of Sothis]].*
> The **Eye of Sothis** is the only island in the [[Crimson Canal]]; the canal connects the [[Osirion|Osirian]] capital of [[Sothis]] to the [[River Sphinx]] a dozen miles away.



## The North

> The ovoid island holds the headquarters of the city watch—the [[Eyes of Sothis]]—in the First Fortress on the northern end. Two smaller garrisons protect the public bazaar and the [[Black Dome]].


## The Plaza

> At the center of the island, a large public plaza allows access to bridges across the canal tall enough to allow the passage of [[Ship|ships]] underneath them; contains a reconstructed obelisk to [[Azghaad]]; and provides a space for food vendors, merchants, and visitors.


## The South

> The southern edge of the island holds warehouses and commercial docks, as well as 'the Mote': the center of the cult of [[Norgorber]] in Osirion.
