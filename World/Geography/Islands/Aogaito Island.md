> **Aogaito Island** lies in the extreme south-east of [[Minkai]], in the Sorui Gulf. On paper, it is the feudal domain of the Kinoshita family, but in practice, its coves and shoals have long been a haven for [[Pirate|pirates]]. Young Kinoshitas claim that they have no ties to the family, while the patriarch Domeki is said to be either too senile to effectively combat the pirates, or is their secret leader.
