**Motaku Isle** is the largest of the islands of the [[Shackles]]. It is west of the mainland, and south of [[Bag Island]]. Its main settlement is the port of [[Quent]], ruled by [[Tessa Fairwind]].


## Geography

> Motaku Isle is geographically diverse. Quent and the three other notable Motaku's settlements ([[Bogsbridge]], [[Lilywhite]], and [[Rapier Bay]]) are located on the north and west coasts. Beyond the sandy beaches of the settlements, the untamed and deadly [[Chenogg Rainforest]] (also known as Motak Jungle) dominates the north part of the isle, while the [[Karsule Swampland|Karsule Swamplands]] cover the south and east coasts. The [[Paego Peaks]], a squat range of granite mountains having three active volcanoes, bisects the isle. Finally, the rugged hills just below the mountains, called the [[Takalak Hills]], are the hunting grounds of dangerous carnivorous.
