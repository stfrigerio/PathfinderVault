The [[Rahadoum|Rahadoumi]] island of Nuat.
> 
**Nuat** is a large island in the [[Arcadian Ocean]], opposite the city of [[Botosani]].
> It is roughly fifty miles off the coast of [[Rahadoum]], and serves as the Rahadoum Navy's first line of defence against the pirates of the [[Shackles]] to the south. The navy maintains a sizeable fleet here, and the sea lanes leading to the Rahadoumi capital of [[Azir]] are heavily patrolled. This deters all but the bravest or most foolhardy of smugglers and pirates.
> Most of the island is flat and at close to sea level, and it enjoys warm rain from the south. The land is the most fertile land in Rahadoum. Much of it is given over to fishing and agriculture, and large amounts of food are exported to the mainland. 
> The island is particularly at risk from storms, and the inhabitants are very superstitious. The [[Pure Legion]] tolerates these beliefs, which include legends of the [[Thin Men]], spirits that are said to haunt the cane fields.
