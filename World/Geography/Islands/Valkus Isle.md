*Valkus Isle'* is a large island off the eastern coast of [[Garund]] and claimed by the nation of [[Nex]]. At one time, it was a relatively peaceful land of plantations. Its only real settlement, the coastal town of [[Khulo]], was a popular vacation spot for the nobility of nearby [[Quantium]] on the mainland.
> The archmage [[Nex (person)|Nex]] decided the island's remote and rugged interior was an ideal spot to build a palace. It was here that he conducted some of his first experiments in manipulating the planes—the first steps on the long road that would eventually lead to his creation of the [[Crux of Nex]]. However, his experiments here went badly wrong. Planar forces and strange monsters ran amok on the island, and Nex was forced to contain them using the *[[Stalwart Wall]]*.
> The Wall contained the threat, but turned the entire island into an inescapable prison. Since then, Valkus Isle has been used as a dumping ground for unwanted prisoners, dangerous monsters, and anything else the rulers of Nex wish to rid themselves of.
