> **Zvartjan** is a series of islands located in [[Iobaria|Iobarias]] [[Deeprun Crevasse]]. Rising out of [[Lake Pirstjoi]] near where the [[Myrfrus River]] leaves the crevasse, it is believed the [[Cyclops|cyclopes]] of the [[Koloran Empire]] quarried much of their stone from these islands. The local [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaur]] populations fear the place, and the few [[Humans|humans]] have explored the islands and lived to tell of their findings. The islands themselves are cloaked in thick fog for most of the day, while at night strange screams and howls echo from the islands.
