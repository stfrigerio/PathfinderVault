> **Rampore Isles** in the [[Shackles]] have been colonized by [[Vudra|Vudrani]] sailors. The town of [[Ghrinitshahara]] once resembled the hamlets and villages of the distant Kingdom of Vudra. In [[4662 AR]] three rakshasas, fleeing bounties placed on their heads by a powerful rajah, managed to infiltrate Rampore's loose organization. Within 2 years the three evil outsiders assassinated or imprisoned all rival Vudrani pirate lords. The boldest of the three was [[Bedu Hanji]] who managed to do away with his equally treacherous partners and became the master of the isles. Ghrinitshahara became the center of a thriving business around the trade of humanoid slaves.
> Rampore has a large, well-armed armada to protect goods being brought into the islands. Hanji is in a fierce conflict with the [[Bag Island]]. Captured sailors of the Bag Island ships are crucified on the southern shoreline of the largest of the Rampore islands which Hanji himself maliciously named the [[Halfling Coast]].
