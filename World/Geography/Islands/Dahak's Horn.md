> When the great [[Dragon|dragon]]-priest [[Aashaq]] came to the [[Shackles]], she chose the rocky island of **Dahak's Horn** for her loyal [[Humanoid|humanoid]] worshipers to inhabit. Thick vegetation covers much of the island, which is home to many breeds of [[Poisons of Golarion|poisonous]] [[Serpent|serpents]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|arachnids]]. Their venom can be used as both poison and antidote, and many [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemists]] have lost their lives seeking them. The only settlement on the island is [[Dragonsthrall]], a confusing collection of structures made of stones, wood, and mud, gathered on a wide bay open to the dangerous Straits of Aashaq.
