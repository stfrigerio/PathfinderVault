> The **Starstone Isles** collectively refers to the [[Isle of Kortos]] and [[Isle of Erran]] in the [[Inner Sea]]. ("Kortos" means "starstone" in [[Azlanti]], and the Isle of Kortos is sometimes referred to as "Starstone Isle".) [[Aroden]] raised the isles from the sea floor in [[1 AR]] in the act of bringing the *[[Starstone]]* from its resting place in the Inner Sea's depths. Due to their importance to the people, [[Absalom]] and the Starstone Isles are usually considered a [[Microregion|microregion]] of the [[Inner Sea region]] in their own right.
