**Redbow Isle**, **Redbow** or **Redbow Island** is a barrier island close to the [[Nalt's Island|Nalts Island]] in the [[Shackles]]. A dangerous tribe of [[Vegepygmy|vegepygmy]] natives live on the Redbow. They use to launch attacks at any [[Ship|ships]] that dare pass through the straits between Redbow and Nalt's Island. Their strategy is to force unwary ships toward the whirling vortex beneath [[Whirlpool Rush]] on the straits' far side. The vegepygmies make their characteristic gleeful clicking noises during their assault.
