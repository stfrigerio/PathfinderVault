 Jeggare Isle can be seen off shore of the city in the upper left of the picture.
> **Jeggare Isle** is a small island in [[Conqueror's Bay|Conquerors Bay]], just a few hundred feet off [[Korvosa|Korvosas]] [[South Shore]] neighborhood. It contains a single building: [[Palin's Lighthouse|Palins Lighthouse]]. The island is presumably named after [[Montlarion Jeggare]], one of the city's founders, although it could also be named after another member of his [[House Jeggare|prestigious family]].
