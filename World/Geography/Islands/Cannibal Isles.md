> The westernmost islands of the Shackles are known as the **Cannibal Isles**. They consist mainly of tiny atolls, and have not been settled by the [[Shackles Pirates]]. Instead they are home to ferocious [[Kuru|kuru]] cannibals, who live in the numerous [[Ghol-Gan]] ruins.


## Inhabitants

> By day, the islands are deceptively peaceful, and those ignorant of the islands' true nature may be tempted to drop anchor in one of the many lagoons. At night, however, the jungles are illuminated by torch-lit processions of the kuru, and the night air rings with a horrible chanting. The kuru launch night-time assaults on anchored ships, seeking to capture the crews. The beggar [[Strong-Arm Hix]] claims to be the sole survivor of one such luckless ship's company.


### Settlements

> The island contains two kuru settlements, both of which are former Ghol-Gan ruins: [[Banukmaud]] and [[Ganagsau]].
