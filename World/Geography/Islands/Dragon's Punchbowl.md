Location of [[Sandpoint]], near the site of the Dragon's Punchbowl.
> 
The **Dragon's Punchbowl** is a small island approximately a mile and a half off the coast of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Sandpoint]] along the [[Lost Coast]]. Less than half a mile in length, it is largely a group of stony ridges that rise nearly 50 feet out of the sea and surround a small lake at the island's center. It is said to primarily be the roosting place of [[Wyvern|wyverns]], although a mysterious [[Dragon|dragon]] has long been rumored to visit the island once or twice a year for unknown reasons.
> The Punchbowl was, until recently, the home to two [[Black dragon|black dragon]] siblings who resided in the flooded caves under the island's lake. The elder of these, [[Scarhorn]], recently evicted her younger brother, [[Black Fang]], from the nest; Black Fang has since found a new home in the [[Tors Sandpoint hinterlands|Tors]] on the mainland. Scarhorn remains in the lair beneath Dragon's Punchbowl, but she never hunts within 50 miles of her home so that none know she lives there.
