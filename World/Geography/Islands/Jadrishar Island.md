> **Jadrishar Island** is located just off the west coast of [[Oppara]] having full view of the river traffic. This island district is occupied fully by the [[Taldan Imperial Navy]]. The [[Imperial Navy Headquarters]], the [[Imperial Naval College]] and the River Guard Academy are located on the island which is surrounded by thick, blackened stone walls. Its one gate on the south side is a fortress unto itself. Large docks line the southern shore of the island and dozens of [[Taldor]]'s warships are at anchor there.
