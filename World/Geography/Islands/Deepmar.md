> **Deepmar** is a small coastal island 75 miles from the mainland of [[Ravounel]]. It is only a short boat ride away from the city of [[Vyre]] on [[Vyre Island]]. The closest coastal city is [[Kintargo]]. Its southern coast was formerly the site of a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] mining facility and penal colony,  which has recently been discovered to be abandoned, and the few survivors mutter about *the lights from below*. On the darkest nights, Deepmar is crisscrossed by eerie lights originating from a tunnel network.
> The island is approximately 30 miles across at its widest point. It is covered  by many stretches of forest and expansive meadows with tall grass and wildflowers.
