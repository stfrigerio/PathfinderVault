> The **Shibobeka Islands** are the largest islands in the [[Atas Pulu]] region of the [[Minata|Wandering Isles of Minata]]. They are a series of islands formed from the remains of [[Mount Shibotai]] when it erupted in [[-2524 AR]] during the [[Age of Ashes]]. The Shibobekas are home to various tribes of [[Wayang|wayangs]] who believe that their emergence from the [[Shadow Plane|Plane of Shadows]] coincided with this colossal eruption. The most central of the Shibobeka Islands is made of the remains of the [[Volcano|volcanos]] crater and contains the wayang city of [[Inahiyi]].
