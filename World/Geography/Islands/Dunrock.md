> **Dunrock** is one of the two islands that make up the [[Keelwrack]] district of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Vyre]]. Dunrock is infamous for housing one of the most notorious prisons in all [[Avistan]], the hellish [[Dunrock Prison]]. The island was named in honour of its sadistic discoverer, but is smaller than the neighbouring [[Keelwrack Island]]. It is separated from the rest of Vyre by the shallow and aptly named [[Keelwrack Harbor]].
