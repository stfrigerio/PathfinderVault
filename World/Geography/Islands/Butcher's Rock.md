> **Butcher's Rock** is a small island that can be found amongst the [[Pirate|pirate]] isles of [[Shackles|the Shackles]]. Butcher's Rock is named for a vast, flat slab of gray granite that sits atop most of the island, looking like a colossal cutting block. This block lies at a thirty-degree angle, stretching from the waterline of the [[Arcadian Ocean]] upwards to over a thousand feet high at its opposite end. About midway along its length, the rock is almost hewn in two, as if from the colossal blow of some [[Deity|god]]. Below this huge rock structure, the rest of the island is made up of layers of rock. The beaches surrounding the island consist of jagged rocks with only a few stretches where a [[Boat|boat]] could safely land; this area is also home to [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Horse|horse]]-sized giant crabs. Further up, much of the island is ringed with numerous caves that are home to the island's [[Cyclops|cyclopes]]. 
 The island boasts little greenery, only moss, some sharp-leafed bushes, and a handful of twisted trees. The island is dotted with ancient blocks of stone from some sort of [[Ghol-Gan]] ruin: these blocks often bear disturbing carvings of [[Human|human]] sacrifice and [[Cannibalism|cannibalism]]. Butcher's Rock is home to the cyclops seer [[Xanae]].
