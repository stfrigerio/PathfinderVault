> **Bukorang** is one of the islands that make up the [[Tengah Pulu]] region of [[Minata]]. Bukorang has a vaguely hammer-like shape and is unique in that it is entirely inhabited by [[Wayang|wayangs]]. While wayangs are common on many of the Wandering Isles, Bukorang is the only island where they are the sole inhabitants.
