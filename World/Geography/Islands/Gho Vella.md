> **Gho Vella** is a small island in the [[Obari Ocean]] off the northeastern coast of the island nation of [[Jalmeray]]. The closest larger settlement to the island is the port city of [[Padiskar]]. The island has an ominous reputation, as it is the final destination of the Jalmeri who suffer from incurable afflictions. As Jalmeray is a nation of many spell-casters, [[Genie|genies]], and other creatures capable of performing [[Magic|magic]], it has its fill of strange [[Curse|curses]] and [[Diseases of Golarion|diseases]]. Those who are incurable (or who can't afford a cure) are sent via small boats to Gho Vella. These transport vessels are operated by a dedicated group of [[Philosophy|philosophers]] known as the [[Curse Shepherds]], who make sure that anyone who wishes to reach the island can do so, but who keep the motivations for performing this dangerous task hidden to outsiders.
