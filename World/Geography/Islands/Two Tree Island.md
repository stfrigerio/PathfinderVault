> **Two Tree Island** is a small island in the [[Steaming Sea]], located close to the much larger island of [[Hermea]]. It is named after the two trees brought by [[Mengkare]], overlord of Hermea, from his childhood home as a reminder for his family, each tree representing each parent. Mengkare regularly visits the trees and speaks with them as if they were his parents, leading some to believe that he could actually communicate with their [[Soul|souls]].
