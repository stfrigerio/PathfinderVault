> The **Midnight Isles** is an [[Abyssal realm]] of many islands shrouded in sensual immorality and eternal darkness. It is ruled by the nascent [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Shamira]], who succeeded her former mistress [[Nocticula]] after she became a [[Deity|deity]] and left the [[Abyss]].
> The island chain is located in [[Dagon|Dagons]] ocean of [[Ishiar]] in an area where the water is black, and it is always night. The ocean here is linked to the [[River Styx]]. The islands are lit by a large, pale [[Moon|moon]] for eight hours, then by dim, unnatural points and threads of light for eight hours.
> Each island is associated with a powerful entity that had been assassinated by Nocticula, and her realm expanded with a new island after each new assassination. Each island is ruled by a unique [[Succubus|succubus]] or [[Incubus|incubus]], and has its own ecology based on the victim the island represents.
> The largest island at the centre of the archipelago is [[Alinythia island|Alinythia]], Nocticula's former home, where the succubus queen found her own pleasures. They included the company of Shamira, appointed by Nocticula as ruler over the island and her capital city of [[Alushinyrra]].
