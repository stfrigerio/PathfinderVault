The **East Fang** is the eastern landmass of the [[Dahak's Fang|Dahaks Fang]] island in the [[Shackles]] covered mostly by rainforest. Wildlife thrives in the humid environment (predatory [[Cat|cats]], primates, reptiles and amphibians), with many [[Animal|animals]] growing to monstrous size. [[Wyvern|Wyverns]], including [[Aashaq's wyvern|Aashaqs wyverns]], nest around the edges of East Fang island. Several natural pits (cenotes) are scattered in the jungle, allowing access to aquatic caves occupied by a rather large clan of saltwater [[Merrow|merrows]]. These caves also exit the land far below the waterline in [[Fellhope Canyon]] from where these merrows launch attacks on any boats using the canyon straits.
