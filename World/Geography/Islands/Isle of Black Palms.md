> The **Isle of Black Palms** is a small island off the eastern coast of [[Garund]], only 80 miles off the southeastern coast of [[Katapesh]] and just north of the much larger [[Valkus Isle]]. It is claimed by nation of [[Nex]]. Amid the dead palms stands a lonely minaret of a ruined mosque thought to be the home of an extremely rare [[Black jinni|black jinni]]. Any ship that approaches the island is beset by horrible misfortunes, ash storms, or bloody murder. None who have set foot on the island's sands has ever been heard from again.
