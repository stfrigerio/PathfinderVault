> **Crimson Island** is one of the sixteen city districts of [[Sothis]] lying on the 'upper' edge of the city. To its north are the industrial [[Canal District]] and the prosperous [[Baza's Pool|Bazas Pool]] city districts; to the south is the wealthy [[Triangle Gate]] district. As its name implies, this district is an island separated from its better neighbours by especially wide canal branches of the [[Crimson Canal]]. Due to its seedy reputation, its neighbouring districts are presumably grateful for the isolation the canals bring. The island is almost one large free market, although it is known to attract corrupt and unsavoury businesses. Such disreputable business means the authorities of the city have to keep a close eye on the Island: the [[Eyes of Sothis]] and the Ministry of Culture are particularly engaged here, especially the former organization keen to prevent the spread of crime and corruption from the Island to elsewhere in the city.
