> **Dog's Teeth** is a group of rocky islets just off the coast of [[Grayguard Castle]], in [[Cassomir]]. It is home to a large number of [[Vagabond|vagabonds]] and rogues, completely ignored by the [[Cassomir constabulary]]. At low tide, the Dog's Teeth islets are connected to the beach below the castle, while at high tide the inhabitants use rickety canoes to reach the shore. This unofficial district of Cassomir is ruled by an old [[Half-orc|half-orc]] named [[Tarik the Unclean]]. The district is the heart of the city's black market, and Tarik uses the money to bribe the influential nobility of the city and maintain his power in Dog's Teeth.
