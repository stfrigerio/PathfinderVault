> One of [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] most heavily industrialized districts, **Kyver's Islet** is almost entirely taken up by loud or heavy industry. Kyver's Islet itself sits in the middle of the [[Yondabakari River]] where the river empties into the vast [[Varisian Gulf]] and the islet is surrounded by patches of sandbar and shallow water. The shore of this small island is almost entirely covered in lumber mills and shipyards, all vying for the limited space. The only real building of note in this otherwise uninteresting district is the small lighthouse at the northernmost tip of the island called the [[Floodfire]], which serves to warn ships away from the dangerous sub-aquatic terrain which is near Kyver's Islet.
> Kyver's Islet is governed as part of the city district of [[Ordellia]].
