> **Veedesha** is an island off the western coast of the island-nation of [[Jalmeray]] in the [[Obari Ocean]]. The closest larger settlement to the island is the capital city of [[Niswan]]. Largely abandoned, Veedesha is now the domain of bandits and predatory monsters.


## History

> Veedesha was once home to Jalmeray's largest port city that served host to many of the island-nation's earliest arrivals. The hinterlands were planted with sugar-cane and [[Coffee|coffee]] that made Veedesha a center of wealth and trade. Over the centuries, the focus of trade moved to [[Niswan]] and Veedesha declined in importance, and was eventually abandoned altogether.


### Inhabitants

> The island is home to tiny manifestations of living fire, known as cinderwisps. These are believed to be the legacy of the [[Efreeti|efreeti]] that once called the island home.
