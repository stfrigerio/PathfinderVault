Mosquito Island, located northeast of [[Mediogalti]].
> 
**Mosquito Island** is a small island northeast of [[Mediogalti]] and west of [[Slitherfish Island]]. It is used by the [[Red Mantis]] as a training ground for its assassins, and is prohibited to anyone else. They enforce the ban by patrolling the approaches in small, fast boats—intruders are killed out of hand.
> At one time, the island was the stronghold of the infamous [[Pirate|pirate]] leader [[Tyrax|Tyrax Blood-Bones]]. According to legend, his treasure is hidden somewhere on the island, tempting treasure hunters to risk the wrath of the Red Mantis in order to search for it.
