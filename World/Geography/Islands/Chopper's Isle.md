> **Chopper's Isle**, a small tidal island just north of [[Sandpoint]]'s [[Old Light]], is also known as **Stoot's Rock**, from the name of its first, last, and only resident, [[Jervas Stoot]]. After Stoot was outed as the mass-murdering Chopper, the citizens of Sandpoint ripped out the stairs that had been built for Stoot years earlier and burned his house down. Today, steep cliffs must be climbed to get on or off the island.
