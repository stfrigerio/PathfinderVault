> **Maskyr's Island** is a small islet in the center of the [[Velashu River]] within [[Riddleport]]. It holds the current overlord's citadel as well as many of the city's various administration buildings. Many docks provide access to the island which is heavily guarded. The island is named for [[Cabriem Maskyr]], the [[Pirate|pirate]] captain who became the first overlord of Riddleport.
