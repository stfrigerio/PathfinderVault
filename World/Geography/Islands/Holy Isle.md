The mythical **Holy Isle** stands at the center of the [[Cove of the Queen]], the beautiful cove in the [[Besmara's Throne|Besmaras Throne]] island in the [[Shackles]]. The horseshoe-shaped Holy Isle is covered by mists that vanish when a worshiper of [[Besmara]], following the inlet that starts just west of the the northern curve of the Besmara's Throne island, passes the second narrowing and emerges gloriously into the cove. A dozen [[Ship|watercrafts]] sail the cove moving to and from the Holy Isle where Besmara's enormous [[Besmara's Temple|temple]] lies. Half of the temple is submerged in the islet's tiny bay. Priests and acolytes in black [[Silk|silk]] work in the temple, performing ceremonies and welcoming those that end their [[Voyage Besmara|Voyage]] there. An old woman, [[Laharra Seaspray]], the current high priest of Besmara, is always found within the temple.
