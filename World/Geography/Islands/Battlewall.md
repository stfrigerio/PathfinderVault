Battlewall, at center.
> 
**Battlewall** is the most civilized and populated of the islands within the [[Ironbound Archipelago]] and the most westerly island comprising the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of the [[Ironbound Islands]]. The island gains it name from the appearance of its upthrust hills which loom over the surrounding sea like a rampart. The lowlands of the island are some of the most fertile farmland in the entire region. [[Halgrim]], the capital of the Ironbound Islands, is found on the north of the island, while the town of [[Frembrudd]] is perched above the southern cliffs of the island. Away from these larger settlements, the rural reaches of Battlewall are populated by farmers whose families have often dwelt on the same patch of land for dozens of generations and are generally suspicious of both outsiders and change.
> The centre of Battlewall is dominated by a forbidding mountain chain that is inhabited by [[Giant|giants]] that fled the fall of [[Cyrusian|Old Cyrusian]] and are distant descendants of the ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] empire's giant [[Slaves|slaves]]. The new queen, [[White Estrid]], has earned a lot of respect from the dour lowland farmers by increasing patrols that have mostly kept the rampaging giants and the other monsters contained within the mountains.
