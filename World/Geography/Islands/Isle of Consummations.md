> The **Isle of Consummations** is a small island in the [[Shackles]], northwest of [[Tempest Cay]]. Adherents of the mysterious [[Cult of the Eye]] are expected to make a pilgrimage to the isle and undergo some secret ceremony in a partially submerged temple to the [[Deluged God]] converted from [[Ghol-Gan]] ruins.
