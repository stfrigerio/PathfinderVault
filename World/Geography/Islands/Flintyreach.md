Flintyreach, at center.
> 
**Flintyreach** is a large island within the [[Ironbound Archipelago]] situated east of [[PathfinderWiki/Battlewall]] island and a part of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of the [[Ironbound Island]]. It is a sparsely populated island, mostly inhabited by small [[Dwarf|dwarven]] villages and the unique [[Half-orc|half-orc]] settlement of [[Averaka]]. All the settlements of Flintyreach are coastal and heavily fortified as the interior is the domain of [[Hill giant|hill giants]], [[Ettin|ettins]], and even a few [[Troll|trolls]]. These foul [[Giant|giants]] even have their own intimidating fortress named [[Thunderhold]] that sits in the centre of Flintyreach.
