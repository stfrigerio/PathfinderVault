> ***Dreams of a Dustbound Isle***, a [[Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild|Pathfinder Society]] scenario written by [[Matt Duval]] for tier 5-8, was released on June 29, 2022



“

Pathfinders stationed at the [[Grand Lodge]] have been experiencing strange shared dreams. The dreams reveal a mysterious island surrounded by dust and shadows. In the dreams, someone is trapped. They’re calling for help. And someone—or something—doesn’t want them to leave.
> Investigating the dreams, the Society has learned a way for its agents to enter the strange, shadowy, dreamlike landscape. Fearing the dreams represent a larger threat, and with no time to lose, the Society sends an experienced group to investigate.
> Given all the catastrophes at Pathfinder Society lodges these days, it could always be a trap. But someone is in there, and they need help. Besides, what Pathfinder would turn down the chance to explore a dream world which may, in fact, be real?
