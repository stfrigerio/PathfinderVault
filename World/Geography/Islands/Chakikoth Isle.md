Chakikoth Isle, center.
> 
**Chakikoth Isle** is an island in the [[Ironbound Archipelago]] in the [[Steaming Sea]]. It is an independent island—it does not form part of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of the [[Ironbound Islands]].
> It lies between the islands of [[Irrere]] and [[The Gasher]].
> On the island are found the ruins of Old [[Xin-Edasseril]], the capital of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] realm [[Edasseril]], before [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Belimarius]] moved it to the east in [[-5402 AR]]. Many scholars of Thassilon erroneously believe that the ruins on Chakikoth Isle remained the capital until [[Earthfall]].
