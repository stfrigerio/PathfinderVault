> **Crowhollow** is a sinkhole in the [[Sellen Hills]] of northeastern [[Numeria]], and the site of a piece of the *[[Divinity]]* that fell during the [[Rain of Stars]]. It is also the home of a half-mechanical [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|lich]] named [[Alling Third]], a former [[Technic League]] agent who sought [[Immortality|immortality]] in order to fully exploit its [[Technology|technology]].


## History

> In [[4607 AR]], heavy rains in northeastern Numeria opened a wide sinkhole and exposed a section of the *Divinity* that had remained buried up until that point. The local Mountain Crows [[Kellid]] tribe tried to hide it from the Technic League, but its agent Alling Tresorant nonetheless discovered it in [[4628 AR]] and found that he could single-handedly control the important discovery due to its small size compared to [[Silver Mount]].
> As Alling explored the wreck, he became [[Drug|addicted]] to the Numerian fluids inside it and communicated with the strange intelligences that spoke within. Realising that a lifetime would be insufficient to unlock all secrets of Crowhollow, he set out to become a lich, and discovered his own formula for transformation when guided by one such intelligence.
> Alling discovered that the part of the wreck located in Crowhollow was formerly one of the *Divinity'*s hangars, and within it he found a mostly intact shuttle and a damaged [[Extinction wave device|extinction wave device]]. His lair is guarded by hidden laser turrets and contains a damaged interplanetary communicator that produces only static audio and low-quality videos. He has created numerous [[Undead|undead]] creatures and repaired a number of [[Robot|robots]] (mostly [[Torturer robot|torturer robots]], as well as a pair of [[Myrmidon|myrmidons]] and a prized [[Surgeon robot|surgeon robot]]) to serve him and guard his lair.
