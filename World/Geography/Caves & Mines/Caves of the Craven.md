> The **Caves of the Craven** are an enormous network of damp caves and tunnels located beneath the [[Calphiak Mountains]] of western [[Varisia]].  The main inhabitants of the caves are countless tribes of [[Goblin|goblins]] who raid the nearby [[Human|human]] communities of the [[Velashu River]] valley. The tunnels eventually lead down to [[Nar-Voth]], and provide the most direct route from the surface to the [[Troglodyte|troglodyte]] realm of [[Kuvhoshik]]. The goblins of the caves fear the troglodytes, and generally keep out of their affairs.
> The caves also have a connection to ancient history. They were the escape route for a group of [[Elf|elves]] from the nearby city of [[Celwynvian]] in the [[Mierani Forest]], who chose to escape the imminent impact of the [[Starstone]] by fleeing deep underground in [[-5293 AR]]. Although this exodus saved them from the worst ravages of [[Earthfall]], they encountered dangers in the Darklands they had never expected.
