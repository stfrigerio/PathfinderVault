> Beneath the main part of the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] metropolis of [[Highhelm]], tunnels weave through earth and stone connecting thousands of halls and chambers. These lower levels are known as the **Depths** and attract [[Goblin|goblins]], [[Orc|orcs]], and other enemies. Groups of [[Skyseeker|skyseekers]] are sent into the Depths to map unknown sections, recover artifacts, and keep the area secure. The massive structures of the Depths were built within the [[Emperor's Peak|Emperors Peak]] mountain as the dwarves burrowed their way to the surface during their [[Quest for Sky]]. Thousands of years of dwarven culture and history are buried in the Depths.


## Notable locations

> [[Deepscar]] is an abandoned keep hundreds of feet below the [[Inner City]] of Highhelm. The dwarves blocked and barricaded the road to Deepscar thousands of years ago when they vacated the keep and continued their destined Quest for Sky.
