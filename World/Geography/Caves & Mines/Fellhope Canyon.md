> **Fellhope Canyon** is a gorge, formed millennia ago and flooded with the surrounding [[Arcadian Ocean|Arcadian Oceans]] water, that divides the [[Dahak's Fang|Dahaks Fang]] island in the Shackles into two halves: the [[East Fang]] and the [[West Fang]]. 
> Fellhope Canyon has become a legendary destination for thrill-seeking [[Pirate|pirates]]. Piloting a small boat from one end of the canyon to the other, a trek known as the Fellhope Run, is the ultimate drunken challenge for foolhardy sailors. The most famous pirate who took the challenge and lived to tell the tale was [[Hego Gebel]]. The now one-eyed, one-legged pirate can be found in the common room of the [[Lusty Mermaid]] in [[Quent]] narrating the story for newcomers who buy him a drink. Most of his compatriots were not as fortunate and were eaten or eviscerated along that journey.
