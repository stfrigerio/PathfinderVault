> The **Bleaklow Warrens** are a series of caverns and tunnels that sprawl beneath the southern reaches of [[Bleaklow Moor]] carved by the claws of one of the Sandpoint hinterlands' largest [[Ghoul|ghoul]] tribes. The few permanent exits from the warrens to the moors lie along the cliffs bordering the [[Brinestump Marsh]], [[Foxglove River]], and the [[Varisian Gulf]], and most of these are flooded, inhabited by [[Lacedon|lacedons]], [[Trailgaunt|trailgaunts]], and other dangerous [[Undead|undead]].
