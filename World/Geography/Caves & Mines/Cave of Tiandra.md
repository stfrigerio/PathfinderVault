> The **Cave of Tiandra** was the cave complex where [[Tiandra]] hid the [[Azlant|Azlanti]] relics she got in the later years of the [[Age of Darkness]]. Generations later, [[Arustun]] discovered and miraculously interpreted these relics enabling the sunrise of the first [[Human|human]] civilization after [[Earthfall]]: the [[Jistka Imperium]].
> Most Jistkan scholars agree that the legendary Cave of Tiandra is located northeast of what is now [[Manaket]] on the [[Inner Sea]] coast of [[Rahadoum]]. The cave appears to be nothing more than a hillside grotto with a single barren chamber and its low ceiling eroded. However a narrow pitch in the back of the entrance cavern reveals that beneath the initial level lies a vast network of tunnels, dens and hollows, with soaring drops and huge domes. The presence of [[Crysmal|crysmals]] has led the scholars to believe that the Cave of Tiandra once had a link to the [[Plane of Earth]] and perhaps other planes. This may explain how [[Arustun]] gained the miraculous insight from the relics found there, in [[-4160 AR]].
