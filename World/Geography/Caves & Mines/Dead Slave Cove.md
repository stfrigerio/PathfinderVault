> **Dead Slave Cove** is a barren beach of [[Raptor Island]], one of the westernmost islands of the [[Shackles]]. It is located near the mouth of the [[Broken Hope River]], the island's main river. The wild island is used as a place to maroon troublesome enemies captured in battle as well as malcontents and traitors. Most castaways are deposited on the Dead Slave Cove destined to spend the rest of his or her life on Raptor Island. The rocky shores and the jagged reefs prevent [[Ship|ships]] from approaching Raptor Island, so a ship must anchor about a quarter-mile offshore and use a [[Longboat|longboat]] to reach Dead Slave Cove.
