![[Pit_of_Gormuz.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 The [[Tarrasque]] rises from the Pit of Gormuz.
> The **Pit of Gormuz** is a 20-mile-wide chasm located in the [[Windswept Wastes]] of central [[Casmaron]]. Over thousands of years, a dozen [[Spawn of Rovagug]] have emerged from the Pit to threaten [[Golarion]], and legends tell that the god [[Rovagug]] himself was bound at the bottom of the Pit in time immemorial.



## Description

> The land around the Pit consists of cracked mud and sickly plants, swept by strange gales. The pit itself is a great chasm that stretches 20 miles from side to side. The pit appears impossibly deep, but those brave enough to peer over the edge claim to have seen a vague dull glow at the bottom that haunts their dreams afterwards. In truth, the Pit is deeper than any have dared to explore. It descends 2 miles through two layers of the [[Darklands]], cutting all the way to forbidding [[Orv]].


### Locations within the Pit

> The following are some of the locations within the Pit of Gormuz.

> - Bones of the Challenger
> - Broken Empire
> - Court of Fallen Righteousness
> - Crater of Carnal Joining
> - Offal Mountain
> - Trough of the Rough Beast

## History and legend

> During the [[Age of Creation]], an alliance of gods defeated Rovagug, imprisoning him within the [[Demiplane|demiplane]] named the [[Dead Vault]] far beneath Golarion's surface in what today is the Pit of Gormuz. The goddess [[Sarenrae]] repaired the gash in the earth into which the Rough Beast had been flung, and commanded her followers to avoid the smooth scar that remained, knowing that the Rough Beast's proximity could affect any mortal. Her faithful living in nearby [[Ninshabur]] misinterpreted her instructions, however, and instead flocked to the area, eventually founding the settlement of [[Gormuz]] there. Believing Gormuz to be a holy city of Sarenrae, people from all over Casmaron flocked there for millennia, but were slowly corrupted by the imprisoned god Rovagug's dreams. Sarenrae continued sending portents and visions to her faithful in Gormuz during this period, but they were ignored or misinterpreted. She finally sent her [[Herald|herald]] [[Kohal]] to the people of Gormuz in [[-3923 AR]], but they had been so corrupted that they destroyed him instead. In great wrath, Sarenrae smote Gormuz with her scimitar, destroying it completely, and created an enormous rent in the earth that eventually became known as the Pit of Gormuz.
> The [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]] sultans claim that Gormuz was a holy man who guarded the pit for 1,111 years, only finding rest once the [[Age of Darkness]] had passed. [[Orc]] [[Brimstone Haruspex|oracles]] maintain that Gormuz is in fact the name of the first of the spawn, and that the arrival of a [[Raskineya|dark comet]] will signify its return to life.


### Spawn of Rovagug

> The following are some of the Spawn of Rovagug believed to have emerged from the pit over the past few millennia.

> - [[Chemnosit]]
> - [[Tarrasque|The Tarrasque]]
> - [[Ulunat]]
> - [[Volnagur]]
> - [[Xotani]]

## Cults of Rovagug

> The Pit is naturally sacred to worshipers of the Rough Beast. It is an annual pilgrimage site for many of his local cults, who travel there to toss goods, slaves, or other valuables into the Pit as sacrifices, hoping to gain Rovagug's attention and favor.
