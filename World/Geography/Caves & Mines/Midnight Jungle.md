> The **Midnight Jungle** is a maze of tunnels in the [[Darklands]] region of [[Nar-Voth]] that gets its name from the bewildering variety of molds, mushrooms, and slimes to be found there. It is located below central [[Cheliax|Cheliaxs]] [[Whisperwood|Whisperwood forest]]. The region is home to the largest population of [[Vegepygmy|vegepygmies]] in the Darklands, who live in countless small tribes that are often at war with each other. The closest entrance from the surface to this fungoid realm is the bizarre [[Scar Thicket]].
