> **Guiltspur** is an ongoing excavation of a [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] ruin on [[Varisia|Varisias]] northern [[Storval Plateau]], begun and driven by the infamous [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] [[Cadrilkasta]].  The aged wyrm discovered the catacomb only recently and has been unearthing it with the help of enslaved [[Giant|giants]] and [[Ogre|ogres]].  No one knows what the [[Dragon|dragon]] is searching for, but she has not let continued attacks by [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]] or deadly [[Skull ripper|skull rippers]] be a deterrent.

> Underneath Guiltspur is buried Beruvexus, the Pondering Beast: a [[Nalfeshnee|nalfeshnee]] [[Demon|demon]] that has been imprisoned here for thousands of years.
