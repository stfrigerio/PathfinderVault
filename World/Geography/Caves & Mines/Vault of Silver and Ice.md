> The **Vault of Silver and Ice** was a valuable mine in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of [[Bleakmarch]], discovered during the reign of [[Velikas|Queen Velikas]]. 


## History

> The Vault opened in [[4225 AR]] and provided [[Silver|silver]] and precious quartz crystals. In [[4227 AR 1]], only two years after its operation started, a deadly [[Diseases of Golarion|disease]] known as the [[Chillbane fever|chillbane fever]] issued from its depths. Its abused miners, [[Jadwiga]] overseers, and even the [[Ice troll|ice troll]] bosses began contracting the disease. The epidemic resisted the treatment of [[Cleric|clerics]] brought in from [[Algidheart]] and began infecting anyone who entered the Vault. It also spread to the towns of Bleakmarch, eventually reaching Algidheart.
> Queen Velikas was desperately concerned with the spread of the chillbane fever epidemic, which had already devastated the city of Algidheart. The queen's advisers or Irriseni clerics could do nothing to treat the disease. At that time a [[Kellid]] woman named [[Inkit Reli]], ‎enslaved in [[Whitethrone]], presented herself to the Queen, said she was a priestess of [[Desna]], and claimed to be able to stop the epidemic if Queen Velikas would stop raiding her homeland over the [[Gullik River]]. The Queen agreed, and Inkit managed to stop the contagion within a month.
> The Queen kept her promise, but brutalized Inkit and buried her alive in the Vault, which was then sealed with strong magic. Inkit's restless spirit is said to haunt the Vault. The original source of the disease is still unknown.
> Some scholars suggest that a powerful [[Demon|demon]] is imprisoned in the dark depths of the Vault. The demon is simply referred to in the texts as the "Filth", and the dreadful epidemic that almost devastated Irrisen was only a taste of the deadly blasphemies that could be unleashed.
