> **Scrag Deep** is an extensive underwater system of caverns at the deepest point of the [[Glacier Lake]] in [[Irrisen]].
> In the [[Winter War]] a tribe of [[Scrag|scrags]] under the command of the great warlord [[Tirchagac]], fought the [[Ship|longships]] of the [[Djurstor Confederacy]] on Glacier Lake. As a reward, [[Baba Yaga]] gave the scrags dominion over the Scrag Deep. Scrag Deep is still home of the [[Scrag Deep tribe]] descendants of the allies of Baba Yaga.
