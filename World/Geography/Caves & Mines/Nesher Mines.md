The **Nesher Mines** are a small network of tunnels southwest of [[Dustpawn]] that produces [[Iron|iron]] ore. They were operated by two brothers who continued to work the mines despite such a declining in production that its mine carts were sold off and their tracks disassembled. The mine is heavily [[Trap|trapped]] to protect what active veins of iron remain.
> The mine is north of the impact site of an [[Lirgen's Glory|otherworldly object]] that crashed into the Dustpawn hinterlands in [[4612 AR]], drawing the attention of [[Dominion of the Black]] cultists posing as prospectors as well as a [[Sonarisa|survivor]] of the crash.
