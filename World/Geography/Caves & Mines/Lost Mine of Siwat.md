The **Lost Mine of Siwat** is a lost [[Silver|silver]] mine located in the [[Sahure Wastes]] of central [[Osirion]]. It was originally founded in [[4349 AR]], but mysteriously disappeared only a few years thereafter. Few people today even remember that the silver mine (and the small village of [[Siwat]] that grew up around it ever existed.
