The [[Deeptreasure Mining Company]] has a hidden and secret base known as the **Mines of Deeptreasure** that is located on the edge of the [[Bandu Hills]]. The company uses a group of [[Xorn|xorns]] to obtain [[Gem|gems]] from the hills, which are later sold in [[Anthusis|Eleder]]. The xorns have been promised a way home once they supply an unspecified number of gems.
