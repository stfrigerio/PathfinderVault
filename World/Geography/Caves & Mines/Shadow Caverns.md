> The **Shadow Caverns** lie in [[Nidal]]'s sinister [[Uskwood]], not far from the capital [[Pangolais]]. On the surface, they appear to be nothing more than a cave above an icy spring.


## History

> The site was used as a camping ground by soldiers of [[Cheliax]] during the [[Everwar]]. A surprise attack by Nidalese forces drove the soldiers into the cave, and dark [[Magic|magic]] forced them deeper and deeper until they eventually found themselves in [[Nar-Voth]], the upper region of the [[Darklands]]. Eventually the last of their torches gave out, and the soldiers were attacked and massacred by the Shadow Cavern's [[Caligni|caligni]] inhabitants.
> A few months later, Nidal fell to Cheliax, and a Chelish expedition was sent into the caves to find out the fate of the lost garrison. They found the massacre site, but could find no trace of either the missing men or their foes, and gave up the search.
> Since then, Nidal's [[Umbral Court]] made repeated efforts to contact the inhabitants of the caverns. They were eventually able to obtain a trade agreement with the caligni, and Nidal now uses the Shadow Caverns as its gateway to the Darklands.


## Trade with the Darklands

> The main trade good is [[Slave|slaves]]—sold to Nidal by the pirates of the [[Shackles]], and then traded by Nidal to the denizens of Nar-Voth. The business is overseen by [[Visceroth]], an [[Umbral dragon|umbral dragon]] who reveres [[Zon-Kuthon]], and his [[Troglodyte|troglodyte]] minions.
