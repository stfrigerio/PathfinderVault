> The **Witchcaves** are a series of deep caverns in the south eastern region of [[Irrisen|Irrisens]] [[Hoarwood province]].  According to legend, great power lies in these caves, which are also suspected of having an entrance to the [[Darklands]].
> In [[3937 AR]] the survivors of the failed [[Harcatha Rebellion]] fled to the caves in the hope of recruiting Darklands allies to help their cause. Nothing more was heard of them until [[4079 AR]], when an insane force of [[Jadwiga]] emerged from the caves and rampaged across the region until they were wiped out by Irriseni forces led by General Chernim Karina.
> Queen [[Karina]], Irrisen's then ruler, ordered the caves sealed. However, a few adventurers recently defied the ban and investigated the caves – and found them overrun by [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]]. The leader of these fiends is an [[Augnagar|augnagar]] called Ulkrostaz. Some of the Harcartha who entered the caves still live, serving as breeding stock and subject to ongoing torture.
