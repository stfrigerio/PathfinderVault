> The **Thunderscale Warrens** are a large network of caves on [[Mediogalti]], located less than a day's journey inland of the pirate city of [[Ilizmagorti]]. There are numerous rumours about the caves. Some claim that they are a source of gem or gold deposits, whilst others suspect they lead deep into the earth and perhaps link to the [[Darklands]]. What is known for sure is that the warrens are home to the [[Thunderscale]] tribe, the largest of the island's tribes of [[Kobold|kobolds]].
