> The **Deeprun Crevasse** is a deep canyon carved by the [[Myrfrus River|Myrfrus or Deeprun River]] in eastern [[Iobaria|Iobarias]] [[Dvezda Marches]]. Over three miles wide in places and flanked with treacherous cliffs, the floor of the Deeprun Crevasse is a rocky wasteland filled with small crags, snowdrifts, and broken blocks of ice washed downstream by the Myrfrus.


## Geography

> The northern reaches of the Deeprun Crevasse are lined with almost-glacial ice on either side of the [[Myrfrus River]]. Hoarfrost coats much of the surrounding wastelands, and snow drifts up to fifty feet high pile up along the cliff faces.
> In the central portion of the crevasse, near the three mile tall statues of [[Baba Yaga]] known as [[Artrosa]], a series of plateaux cross the canyon's floor, creating a series of spectacular waterfalls. Thirty miles south of Artrosa, the forest of [[Hoofwood]] spreads over the cliffs and down to the floor of the crevasse, and the [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] of the woods have carved trails allowing them to access the Myrfrus.
> South of the Hoofwood, the Myrfrus pours over a series of cliffs, upon which nest thousands of bloodhawks, [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Eagle|eagles]], and other large raptors who hunt the salmon of the river. South of the falls, the Myrfrus spreads out to cover a small plain, creating the massive, circular [[Lake Pirstjoi]], from which rises the island known as [[Zvartjan]]. South of Lake Pirstjoi, the crevasse is bridged by the broken arch of [[Daruthrost]]. The crevasse continues further to the south, past the ruined town of [[Zradnirras]], but ends before the Myrfrus empties into the [[Castrovin Sea]] at the port city of [[Mirnbay]].
