> The **Clicking Caverns** are set of underground tunnels and caverns known to connect to the [[Darklands]] of the continent of [[Tian Xia]] and are located on the border between the nations of [[Xa Hoi]] and [[Nagajor]]. They are inhabited by [[Clockwork|clockwork]] [[Construct|constructs]] [[Haunted construct|haunted]] by the [[Soul|souls]] of their extinct builders.
> In [[-395 AR]], the haunted clockworks poured from the Clicking Caverns and attacked both Xa Hoi and Nagajor. In [[4708 AR]], the [[Nagaji|nagaji]] hero [[Zethivaxus Djeed]] led an ill-advised expedition into the Clicking Caverns, and later emerged as a haunted clockwork himself in an invasion of the highlands of western Xa Hoi.
