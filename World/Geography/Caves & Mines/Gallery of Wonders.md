> The **Gallery of Wonders**, known to some as the **Hall of Wonders**, is one of the underground areas closest to the surface of the much deeper [[Candlestone Caverns]] beneath the [[Aspodell Mountains]] of [[Andoran]]. It was created centuries ago by master [[Dwarven|dwarven]] craftsman Barek Triongger, who built it as a refuge from the chaos of the failing empire of [[Tar Khadurrm]].
