> The **Hope Lost** mine in the [[Irrisen]] province of [[Wintercrux]] produces the rare blue quartz crystals known as [[Ice diamond|ice diamonds]] that are notoriously arduous to excavate. Those forced to work here by the [[White Witches]] or [[Cold Sisters]] generally die quickly due to the mine's brutal conditions.
> The vicious Countess Grinnelise, whose palace is carved into the face of the mountain, is the mine's overseer. Known to have a taste for [[Human|human]] flesh, the slaves working the mine prefer the daily beatings of the [[Ice troll|ice troll]] gang bosses to be summoned to the countess' palace. The screams of the victims during her notorious orgies of cannibalism and torture are unbearable.
> Recently, some lucky slaves managed to escape using a secret tunnel and the help of [[Yeti|yetis]] who dwell in a large warren deep in the mountains. The slaves gave stolen ice diamonds to the yetis in thanks.
