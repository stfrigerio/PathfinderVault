> The **Candlestone Caverns** are a vast labyrinth of living limestone tunnels and caves located in the northeastern [[Aspodell Mountains]] of [[Andoran]] near the border with [[Cheliax]].  They were exposed only two centuries ago in an earthquake. Deep below the Candlestone Caverns is the [[Endless Gulf]], a rift in [[Golarion|Golarions]] crust that connects [[Nar-Voth]], [[Sekamina]], and [[Orv]].



## History

> The Candlestone Caverns have a history that predates their more recent discovery. They once served as a back door of sorts from the [[Darklands]] to the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] kingdom of [[Tar Taargadth]] in the [[Five Kings Mountains]]. [[Orc|Orcs]] surged up from the Darklands through the Caverns in [[1551 AR]], tearing through a number of undermanned garrisons that sat at its entrances. After Tar Taargadth fell, the dwarves sealed the surface entrances to the caverns. The caverns lay hidden for centuries, home to [[Kobold|kobolds]], [[Gremlin|gremlins]], [[Duergar|duergar]], [[Dark fey|dark fey]] and other creatures from below. When the dwarven state of [[Tar Khadurrm]] rose in the early 3200s, its rulers kept watch over the sealed entrances. When Tar Khadurrm collapsed, the caverns faded from memory entirely. The great earthquake of [[4510 AR]] exposed new openings to the caverns, unleashing tides of subterranean raiders upon the human settlements in rural Andoran.


## Inhabitants

> The caverns themselves are inhabited by dangerous vermin, kobolds of the [[Black Claw]] tribe, duergar, and undead, although the main denizens are numerous tribes of gremlins and other subterranean [[Fey|fey]].  The Caverns provide the most direct route from the surface to the [[Nar-Voth]] settlement of the fey known as the [[Court of Ether]].
> Dangerous creatures from deeper in the [[Darklands]] find their way up through the caverns as well, and pose a threat to the local denizens as well as the nearby surface-dwellers.  The clever kobolds of the Black Claw tribe have responded to this by creating a series of one-directional tunnels bypassing their territory and leading directly to the surface.  In this way, many of the abominations which might never see the light of day are provided with a direct and unobstructed route to Andoran, much to the consternation of the local humans.  The kobolds have thus unintentionally given those able to track the Darkland creature's tracks an easy, trap-free path from the surface into the Darklands.
