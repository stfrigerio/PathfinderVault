> The **Stasis Fields** are a mysterious prison in the [[Bandu Hills]]. They consist of numerous underground caverns; in each cavern a solitary figure is held in stasis, floating in mid-air and turning slowly in time with the world's rotation.
> Each prisoner wears turquoise scale armour and is armed with shining blades, giving rise to speculation that they are all prisoners of war from a long-forgotten army. Brave (or foolhardy) adventurers sometimes try to steal their equipment; no one knows what would happen if this caused a prisoner to awaken.
> It was discovered in [[4516 AR]].
