> The **Chamber of Life** is a dome-shaped cavern several miles wide and half a mile tall, located around halfway between the surface of [[Apostae]] and its [[Worldheart|core]]. At its centre lies a thrumming [[Silver|silver]] obelisk, taller than everything else in the cave, which [[Ilee]] couples or triplets visit when they want offspring. When they present themselves to the monolith, a polished black eye opens in its side and bathes them in light; when they return after a year, the obelisk bathes them in light again and presents them with their child. In addition to the monolith, the Chamber of Life is also covered in humming machinery, glowing fungi, bright streamers, and elaborate fetishes. The Ilee consider the Chamber of Life to be neutral ground in their conflicts, as they all understand that without it, they will go extinct.
