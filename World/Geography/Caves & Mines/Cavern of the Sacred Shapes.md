> The **Cavern of the Sacred Shapes** is a location in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Icemark]] once used by the native [[Varki]] as a repository for their sculpture and other [[Art|artwork]]. It was seized several generations ago by a tribe of [[Adlet|adlets]] from the [[Stormspear Mountains]] that has defended it from outsiders ever since. Several attempts have been made by more adventurous Varki to retake the Cavern, but all have failed. Survivors of these attacks have reported that the adlets seem to hold certain of the cave paintings inside as sacred, leading to speculation that the adlets are actually ancient, [[Curse|cursed]] Varki who have returned to reclaim their birthright.ù
