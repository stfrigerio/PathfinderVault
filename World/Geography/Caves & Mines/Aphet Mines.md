Location of the Aphet Mines.
> The **Aphet Mines** are three interconnected copper mines in the [[Footprints of Rovagug]]. They are some of the few existing mines that have not been completely depleted by the [[Pharaoh|Pharaohs]]' demands for [[Weapon|weapons]] and ornamentation.
> The mines are owned by the [[Aspis Consortium]] and overseen by [[Falsin Deek]]. Under the operation of Deek, the mines produce consistently high output, and also operate as a front for the Consortium's movement of goods and people into and out of [[Osirion]].
> The nearby town of [[Aphet East]] provides support to the mine's workers.
