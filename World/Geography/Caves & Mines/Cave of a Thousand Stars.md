> The **Cave of a Thousand Stars** is a system of caves created by a moot of [[Muldnal|muldnal]] [[Agathion|agathions]] in an area of [[Vudra]] where the planar boundaries between the [[Material Plane]] and [[Nirvana]] grow thin. It is a place where the otherworldly perfection of Nirvana seeps into [[Golarion]] as a palpable presence and, as such, is sought out by [[Monk|monks]] and scholars alike.
