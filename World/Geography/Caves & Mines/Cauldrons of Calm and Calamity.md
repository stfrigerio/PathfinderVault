> The **Cauldrons of Calm and Calamity** are a series of mystical caves at the foot of [[Mount Keeba]] on the [[Smoker|island of the Smoker]] in the [[Shackles]]. Within these caves, live the three prophets, known as [[Keeba's Eyes|Keebas Eyes]], who are famous in the Shackles for their wisdom and oracular prowess. Many pilgrims arrive in [[Plumetown]] seeking words of wisdom from the Eyes. They are informed by the residents there that they have to wait in the town until a [[Caretakers|Caretaker]] seeks them out, when one of the Eyes is willing to give an audience. The wait may last from hours to years. When a Caretaker does come to Plumetown with a summons, the silent figure escorts the petitioners on the long paved road to the Cauldrons of Calm and Calamity via the [[Wise Artery]] road. Upon arrival, they are guided to one of the Keeba's Eyes, who hears each petitioner's question and names the non-negotiable price for its answer.
