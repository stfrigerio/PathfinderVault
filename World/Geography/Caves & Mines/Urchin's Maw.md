Located between seventy and eighty miles northwest of [[Acisazi]], the entrance to the underwater cave known as **Urchin's Maw** gapes from the side of the continental shelf, overlooking a precipitous drop into the inky depths below. It earns its name from the riot of sizable deep sea urchins that dwell on the rock face surrounding the cave entrance.
