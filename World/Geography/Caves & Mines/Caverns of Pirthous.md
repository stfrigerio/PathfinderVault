The **Caverns of Pirthous** are a maze of caves and tunnels found beneath [[Iobaria|Iobarias]] [[Syrzemyan Highlands]]. The caverns are the secret winter homes and refuge of the [[Azorva]] [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaur]] clans; no [[Humanoid|humanoid]] has ever discovered their entrances and returned to tell of them.
