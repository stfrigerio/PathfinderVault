> The **Caverns of Chitterwood** lie beneath the [[Chitterwood]] forest. Numerous tribes of [[Goblin|goblins]] make their homes in the Caverns, including the [[True Hoard]], the [[Spine Threshers]], and the [[People of the Stirge]]. Many goblins died during the [[Goblinblood Wars]], but the survivors hole up in the caverns until they can recoup their losses.
