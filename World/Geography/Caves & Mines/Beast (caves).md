> The subterranean complex known as **The Beast** has a pair of entrances in the hill to the east of the town of [[Redtooth]]; Redtooth is the provincial capital of the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province known as the [[Verge]]. The caves are deep and the subterranean passages are unstable. A number of treasure seekers have been trapped and lost in the Beast.
> Redtooth residents are unaware that an ancient [[Wendigo|wendigo]] called [[Yaalagaal|Yaalagaal Eater of Hearts]], has slumbered in a hidden cavern below the Beast for two millennia.
