> The **Aurora Iobara** is a colorful aurora that appears in the skies over the [[Crown of the World]] during the spring and summer. Since the opening of the [[Worldwound]], native [[Mendev|Mendevians]] claim its colors have grown more intense, and it appears more frequently.
> The aurora is strongly associated with the [[Sarkoris|Sarkorian]] [[God|goddess]] [[Pulura]], also known as the mistress of the Aurora Iobara.
