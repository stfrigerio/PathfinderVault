> One of the infinitely myriad realms in the [[Abyss]], the **Sea of Whispering Sands** is the home of the demon lord [[Aldinach]]. It is an enormous desert dotted with ruined, decrepit cities.



### History

> The Sea of Whispering Sands was once the realm of Aldinach's older sister, [[Areshkagal]]. However, Areshkagal was ousted when her sister stole the realm from her some millennia ago, forcing her into the abyssal wasteland of the [[Blood Clefts]]. Now Areshkagal's armies constantly make raids into the Sea of Whispering Sands, trying to reclaim it for their demonic mistress.


### Denizens

> Due to its current master's scorpion form, demonic scorpion-like creatures inhabit much of this realm. [[Gharros demon|Gharros demons]] are Aldinach's main servitors, so they are found often torturing, killing, or bullying lesser creatures. Souls of beings that were once [[Chaotic evil|chaotic evil]] are also found in the Sea, performing mundane tasks like building defenses and forging weapons.


### Terrain

> The Sea of Whispering Sands is a vast desert wasteland, with the clear sweep of the dunes inhabited by demonic version of desert menaces from the [[Material Plane]]. The endless seas of sand are irregularly broken by deserted-looking, ruined cities.
