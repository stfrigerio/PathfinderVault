The Castrovin Sea, at the center of [[Casmaron]].
> 
The **Castrovin Sea** is a large, land-locked body of water that begins near the ancient realm of [[Iobaria]] in northwestern [[Casmaron]] and stretches thousands of miles eastward. It borders the lost kingdoms of [[Ninshabur]] and [[Kaskkari]] in its western and southwestern reaches, the mighty [[Kelesh|Kelesh Empire]] to the south, and fabulous [[Kaladay]] to the northeast. Strange island nations can be found along its coast. At least in its northwestern regions, the Castrovin is harsh and choppy, making it difficult to navigate. Sea traffic is generally limited to small fishing [[Ship|vessels]] which stay close to the coastline. The Castrovin Sea has a generally tempering effect on the climate of Casmaron, increasing rainfall and moderating temperatures along its shores.


## Inhabitants

> The Castrovin Sea is home to noticeably smaller numbers of fish and mundane wildlife than other seas and oceans, and is entirely bereft of cetaceans, limiting the size of the fishing industry. However, it is home to large populations of sturgeon, which are harvested for their valuable roe, and to numerous varieties of turtle, which are hunted for their meat and shells. The eastern Castrovin Sea is also populated by numerous [[Sea cat|sea cats]], large prides of which can be spotted lounging on its stacks and beaches in the summer.
> Sapient natives of the sea include reclusive [[Locathah|locathah]], who sometimes emerge at a specific sea stack in the northwestern part of the sea to trade with passing ships, and more hostile races such as [[Merrow|merrows]] and [[Scrag|scrags]].


## Risky trade

> The Castrovin Sea is the main waterway for trade for the nations along its shores, and countless merchantmen from [[Kelesh]] and other exotic locales make their way along its coasts. This in turn attracts [[Pirate|pirates]] who prey upon the merchants, countered by naval [[Ship|ships]] of the Empire of Kelesh. All but the most foolhardy sailors, however, avoid sailing into the deeper waters. The central Castrovin Sea is plagued by terrible storms and by a maze of rocky islets, juts of volcanic rocks and sea stacks like Casador's Maw, Citadel Allatro, and the Pillars of Trajheir, collectively called the Razored Labyrinth, which make navigation difficult and dangerous. These small outcroppings of land are often the domain of locathah tribes and pale-scaled merrows, who exploit the connections of these islets to deep tunnels to the [[Darklands]].
