> The **Lady's Cape** is the southwestern-most point of [[Varisia|Varisias]] landmass. This hook-like peninsula juts out from the [[Mushfens]] into [[Conqueror's Bay|Conquerors Bay]] and takes its name from its most prominent landmark: the [[Thassilonian]] structure known as the [[Lady's Light|Ladys Light]].


## Geography

> The land of the Lady's Cape is composed mostly of salty marshland, swamps with heavy undergrowth, along with a few hills. Its hook-like peninsula surrounds a shallow body of salt water known as the **Lady's Lagoon**, inhabited by [[Reefclaw|reefclaws]] and the occasional [[Shark|shark]]. **Lake Ghaulos**, a large fresh water pond is fed from the Mushfens by **Slug Creek**.


## Inhabitants

> The most prominent inhabitants of the cape are the [[Boggard|boggards]] of Baladab Souko and the [[Troglodyte|troglodyte]] tribe called the Children of Zevgavizeb. These two groups have been fighting for dominance of the Lady's Cape for quite some time. The [[Half-orc|half-orc]] [[Witch|witch]] [[Maroux]] also makes her home here, but she steadfastly refuses to get involved in the local conflicts between the tribes, and attacks anyone who approaches her home.
