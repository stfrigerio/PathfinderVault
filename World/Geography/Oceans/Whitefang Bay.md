Whitefang Bay, in the northern [[Gulf of Svallmundr]] in the [[Crown of the World]].
> 
**Whitefang Bay** makes up the northern half of the [[Gulf of Svallmundr]]. The bay is covered by ice sheets year-round, but in the summer the ice retreats just far enough that [[Whitefang Peninsula]] can be reached by boat; during the winter, the ice pack extends as far south as [[Cape Almhult]]. [[Whitefang Peninsula]] separates the bay into the **East Bay** and the larger **West Bay**. A handful of [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] fish Whitefang Bay's waters, and the [[Ulfen]] of [[Almhult]] cross the bay to trade with them on rare occasions.
> The [[White dragon|white dragon]] Vegsundvaag once hunted the waters of Whitefang Bay before her mother drove her further to the east.
