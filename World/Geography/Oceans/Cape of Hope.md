> The **Cape of Hope** is the southernmost peninsula of the nation of [[Andoran]]. It juts into the [[Inner Sea]] between [[Aspo Bay]] to the west, and [[Star Bay]] to the east, and is known for its tall cliffs that are home to countless sea birds. A mysterious black obelisk rises from the waves just south of the southern tip of the cape. Its exact origin and purpose is unknown, but it is told that it wards the area from attacks by sea demons.
