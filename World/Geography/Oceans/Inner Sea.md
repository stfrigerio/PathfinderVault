*See also: [[Inner Sea region]]*
> The **Inner Sea** is one of the most heavily traveled and populated bodies of water in [[Golarion]]. Formed when the [[Starstone]] fell to earth in [[-5293 AR]], reshaping the face of the planet, the Inner Sea rests between [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]]. Before [[Earthfall]], the two continents had been joined by a land bridge. The impact collapsed the connection, allowing water from the [[Arcadian Ocean]] to flow in. 
> The sea is now separated from the Arcadian Ocean by the [[Hespereth Strait]] and the [[Arch of Aroden]], which is currently under [[Cheliax|Chelaxian]] control. To the east it connects to the [[Obari Ocean]] between the nations of [[Osirion]] and [[Qadira]].
> The Inner Sea is a cradle of the [[Human|human]] race, and six of the most powerful nations on Golarionâ€”[[Absalom]], [[Andoran]], Cheliax, Osirion, Qadira, and [[Taldor]]â€”lie on its shores. Naval battles between these emerging world powers are commonplace.



## Inhabitants

> There is abundant life beneath the waves of the Inner Sea, including societies of [[Cecaelia|cecaelias]], [[Gillman|gillmen]], [[Locathah|locathahs]], [[Merfolk|merfolk]], and [[Triton|tritons]], as well as monsters like [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]], [[Devilfish|devilfish]], and [[Grindylow|grindylows]].
> While sea monsters are not as big a concern in the Inner Sea as they are in other bodies of water, its waters remain nonetheless home to dangerous creatures such as [[Galvo|galvos]], [[Bunyip|bunyips]], and [[Hammerhead shark|hammerhead]], [[Jigsaw shark|jigsaw]], and [[Bull shark|bull sharks]]. The bull sharks, in particular, have become very common in recent years, which combined with their extreme aggressiveness leads some to think that they may be being controlled by someone for nefarious purposes.
