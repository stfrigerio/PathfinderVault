> The **Songil Sea** is a body of water in [[Golarion]]'s northern hemisphere off the northeastern coast of [[Tian Xia]].



## Geography

> The Songil Sea is part of the [[Crown of the World]], and forms some or all of the coastline of the [[Forest of Spirits]] and [[Minkai]].
> During much of the year, the northern Songil Sea is covered by an ice shelf known as [[Thremyr's Shield|Thremyrs Shield]]. [[Ulaagor Bay]], the [[Gulf of Khorkii]], and Aokori Gulf are all part of its expanse.


## Ecology

> The Songil Sea is comparatively warm for its northern latitude thanks to a warm current that runs through it from the [[Okaiyo Ocean]] to the south. As a result, it is a fertile breeding ground for sea life, making it a popular destination for [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] and [[Minkai|Minkaian]] fishermen. [[Whale|Baleen whales]] come to the Songil Sea to birth their calves, but [[Giant squid|giant squid]] and [[Shark|dire sharks]] also prowl these waters in great numbers.


### Fauna

> Various aquatic races inhabit the Songil Sea, most notably a great number of [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]], but also [[Grindylow|grindylows]], [[DevilfishVariant Devilfish|gutaki]], iku-tursos, [[Kraken|krakens]], [[Sea hag|sea hags]], [[Siyokoy|siyokoys]], and [[Triton|tritons]]. A terrible kraken called Tupta-Wa haunts the Songil Sea, surfacing once every twelve years to terrorize its waters.
