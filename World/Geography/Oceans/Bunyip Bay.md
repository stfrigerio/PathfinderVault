> **Bunyip Bay** is located in northwestern [[Varisia]], where the [[Steam River]] flows into the [[Steaming Sea]]. The abandoned [[Cheliax|Chelaxian]] fortress of [[Brinewall]] stands near its easternmost extensions. It is named after the fearsome seal-like predator known as [[Bunyip|bunyips]] that are known to enter the Steam River hunting for prey.
