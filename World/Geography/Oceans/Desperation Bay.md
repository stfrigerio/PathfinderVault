Technically part of the [[Arcadian Ocean]], **Desperation Bay** is a bay off the west coast of [[Garund]]. It is bordered to the east and south by [[Sargava]] and to the north by the [[Kaava Lands]] of the [[Mwangi Expanse]].
> As well as the Sargavan settlements of [[Anthusis|Eleder]] and [[Crown's End|Crowns End]], villages of the [[Ijo]] fisherfolk also stand on the shores of the bay. The Ijo are plagued by attacks from [[Ombo]] [[Pirate|pirates]] operating out of [[Senghor]].
