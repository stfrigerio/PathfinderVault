> **Cape Kraken** is a peninsula that juts out into the [[Arcadian Ocean]] off the western coast of [[Cheliax]]. To its north lies [[Hellmouth Gulf]], while the [[Pillars of Anferita]] can be found to the south. The ruins of the city of [[Narona]] lie along the cape's northern coast, while the island of [[Shardstone]] lies just off of it.
