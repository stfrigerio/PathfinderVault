> The **Cerulean Sea** is a sea on the [[First World]], regarded as safer to travel than the Sea Without a Shore, but nonetheless filled with [[Pirate|pirates]] and sea monsters who seek to prey upon the many traders sailing between its scattered islands. The Cerulean Sea is the only place where the rare skald fish can be found. At the bottom of its deepest trench lies [[Karaphas]], home to the [[Eldest]] [[Ragadahn]], who claims the Cerulean Sea as his own but does little to police it.
