> **Jellicoe Bay** is a small body of water that is part of the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]] in northeastern [[Avistan]], and is located off the northern shores of [[Brevoy]]. The bay is the home of the [[Jundlan Wrecks]], a collection of flotsam left over from a battle between [[Issia|Issian]] pirates, now haunted.
