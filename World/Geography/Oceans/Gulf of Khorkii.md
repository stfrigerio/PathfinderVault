> The **Gulf of Khorkii** is an inlet of the [[Songil Sea]] that separates the [[Crown of the World]] from the eastern reaches of [[Tian Xia]]. Thousands of small islands are scattered across the gulf, possibly the remnants of a fallen portion of the [[Wall of Heaven]]. The gulf is often choked with icebergs due to mountain glaciers breaking off into its waters. The coast of the Gulf is where the [[Khorkii Clans]] reside.
