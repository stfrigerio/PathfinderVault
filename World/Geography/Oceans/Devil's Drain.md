> **Devil's Drain** is a dangerous whirlpool that lies in the [[Steaming Sea]] between the coasts of [[Southmoor]] and the [[Ironbound Islands|Ironbound Island]] of [[Dragon's Rib|Dragons Rib]]. On a good day, there is just enough room either side of the Devil's Drain for a [[Ship|ship]] to pass through, though it is always treacherous. Using this route saves enough time on the passage to [[Varisia]] that desperate captains will still sometimes risk it. Devil's Drain appears to be a natural occurrence formed by oceanic currents but [[Adventurer|adventurers]] who have returned from its depths report mysterious deep rifts in the ocean floor below it. To make matters worse, the area surrounding Devil's Drain is known to have at times been home to [[Dragon turtle|dragon turtles]], [[Fjord linnorm|fjord linnorms]], [[Scylla|scyllas]] and [[Kraken|krakens]] who often drive ships into the whirlpool to feast on the shipwrecked sailors.
