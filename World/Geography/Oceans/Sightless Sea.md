![[Munavri.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A [[Munavri|munavri]], member of a race of sailors on the Sightless Sea.
> The **Sightless Sea** is by far the largest of the known Vaults of [[Orv]]. It lies beneath the [[Arcadian Ocean]], and is of a similar size. There are numerous tiny islands in the sea, many settled by [[Urdefhan|urdefhan]], but others claimed by even stranger creatures. On average, the sea is a mile deep, but in places it is much deeper.


## Geography

> The Sightless Sea is linked to the Arcadian Ocean via the "reverse waterspout" known as the [[Braid]], which leads up to the [[Inverted Sea]]. A current from the Sightless Sea flows up the Braid, through the Inverted Sea, into the Arcadian Ocean and then into the [[Inner Sea]]. From there, it seeps down into [[Lake Nirthran]] and eventually finds its way back into the Sightless Sea. In theory, this grants the [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]] access to most of [[Golarion]], although there have never been any confirmed sightings of alghollthus coming down with the rain that lands in the [[Midnight Mountains]]. In fact, alghollthus prefer not to make use of the Braid themselves, instead sending their magically controlled servants up the water column on missions spanning years. Other natives of the Sightless Sea seek to make use of the Braid for their own purposes, but alghollthus prevent access from the sea itself, and their air-breathing [[Slave|slaves]] mounted on [[Giant bat|giant bats]] and blind, flying [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Lizard|lizards]] patrol the air around it. However, some have been known to slip past these defenses.


## Inhabitants

> The alghollthus are the most powerful faction in the Sightless Sea. At one time, they ruled it all, but today they are apparently content with just controlling most of the depths. Other foul creatures live in the deep regions outside of alghollthu territory; the [[Shoggoth|shoggoths]] are perhaps the worst, and may even pre-date the alghollthus.
> The deep waters of the Sightless Sea are also the hunting grounds of [[Faceless whale|faceless whales]], which stay near the bottom of the sea to avoid predators of their own.
> Some of the islands are inhabited by urdefhan outposts, while others are populated by [[Genie|genies]], [[Neothelid|neothelids]], [[Dragon|dragons]], exiled [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]], telepathic [[Munavri|munavris]], and groups of [[Technological|technologically]]-advanced [[Skum|skum]]. The sea itself is plied by [[Ship|ships]] piloted by [[Denizen of Leng|denizens of Leng]], [[Tiefling|tieflings]], munavris clad in jade [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]], and even more unusual creatures. Munavris primarily use their naval skills to fight the urdefhan. A nation of [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] has also managed to establish a small presence within the Sightless Sea.
