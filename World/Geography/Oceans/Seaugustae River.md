> The source of the **Seaugustae River** is within the [[Evergray]] forest in the very south-eastern part of the county of [[Barstoi]] in [[Ustalav]]. From there, the river quickly crosses the border into the northern reaches of the county of [[Varno]] until it reaches its confluence with the long [[West Sellen River]] at the border of Ustalav with [[Numeria]]. The town of [[Cesca]] lies on a gently sloping hill on its northern bank, called the Mendesanni, about two-thirds of the way along its nearly fifty-mile run.
