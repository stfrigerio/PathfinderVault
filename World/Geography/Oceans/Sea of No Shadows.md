> The **Sea of No Shadows** is a vast sea on the [[Plane|plane]] of [[Nirvana]]; it is so large as to appear almost infinite. It is home to the [[Cetaceal|cetaceal]] race of [[Agathion|agathions]] as well as numerous aquatic [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lords]]. The cetaceal make their homes from beautiful, vivid corals within the coolest reaches of the sea. Vast reed beds flank parts of the shore of the Sea of No Shadows and it is from these reeds that the divine [[Irez]] emerged. The Sea of No Shadows is also flanked by the Skyward Cliffs, home of the empyreal lord [[Ylimancha]].
