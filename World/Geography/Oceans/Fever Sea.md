The **Fever Sea** is the name given to part of the [[Arcadian Ocean]] off the western coast of [[Garund]].
> There is as yet no generally accepted definition of the northern and southern limits of the sea. [[Bloodcove]] has been described as the last port of call on the Fever Sea, and its chief administrator takes the grandiose title of Grand Admiral of the Fever Sea so one notion is that the Fever Sea extends as far south as Bloodcove, but not further south to [[Senghor]].
