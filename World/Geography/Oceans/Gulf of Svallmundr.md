The Gulf of Svallmundr, south of the [[Crown of the World]].
> 
The **Gulf of Svallmundr** is a vast inlet of the [[Steaming Sea]], separating [[Cape Almhult]] from the mainland of the [[Crown of the World]]. The gulf contains numerous sea stacks and rocks near the shore, but has no major islands. [[Almhult]]'s [[Ulfen]] sailors sail the gulf's waters to trade with the [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] of [[Hasanaliat]]. The northern reach of the gulf is known as [[Whitefang Bay]]. In the east, the Gulf of Svallmundr mixes with the brackish [[Hazalin Marshes]].
> Both the Taraska River and Maganis River empty into the Gulf of Svallmundr.
