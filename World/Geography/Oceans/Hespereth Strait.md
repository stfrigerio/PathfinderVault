> The **Hespereth Strait** (also known as the **Straits of Aroden**) is a narrow channel of water approximately 15 miles in width which connects the [[Arcadian Ocean]] with the [[Inner Sea]]. It was formerly bridged by the [[Arch of Aroden]], and is the closest the continents of [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]] come to meet. Both sides of the strait are currently controlled by the country of [[Cheliax]].


## History

> The Hespereth Strait, along with the rest of the Inner Sea, was created by the impact of the [[Starstone]] in [[-5293 AR]]. Before that catastrophe, a landbridge connected the continents of Avistan and Garund where the strait is low located.
