> **Shenchu Bay** is an island between [[Dahak's Fang|Dahaks Fang]] and the rocky shores of the mainland, in the [[Shackles]]. It has been settled by liberated sailors from [[Tian Xia]]. The empire of [[Lung-Wa]] sent forth many ships to explore [[Golarion]]'s oceans before its collapse. Some of these expeditions reached the Shackles. The sailors of the Tian fleets were tempted from the free life of the [[Pirate|pirates]], and many crews mutinied, hung their former officers and turned to piracy. In time some of them established a pirate base on the island and named it Shenchu Bay, which means "freedom" in [[Tien]].
> Most of Shenchu Bay's inland is swampy and well suited for rice paddies, which are tended by [[Slavery|slaves]] and peasants, many from other Tian ethnicities. Shenchu island is almost completely self-sufficient. The slaves who work the paddy fields live in tents and huts and are overseen by the cruel neh cang. The island is ruled by an elected council named [[Wise Council of Three]]. The main settlements on the island are [[Cho-Tzu]] and [[Haigui Wan]].
