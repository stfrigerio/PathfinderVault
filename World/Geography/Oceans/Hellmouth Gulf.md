> **Hellmouth Gulf** is a large bay on [[Cheliax|Cheliaxs]] western coast on the [[Arcadian Ocean]]. It runs from [[Cape Kraken]] in the south to the [[Sallow Coast]] in the north. The islands of [[Thuryan]] and [[Bog Rock]] lie off of Hellmouth Gulf, and the village of [[Blackcove]] is the only settlement of any note. Dark sand and sharp rocks cover most of the bay's beaches, and the water often carries with it a sulfurous smell. Most travellers avoid the waters of Hellmouth Gulf, as the coastline is known for his sharp rocks that lurk just below the waterline, waiting to tear passing [[Ship|ships]]. The waters of the gulf are also home to a greatly feared [[Sea serpent|sea serpent]], who is usually only referred to with a sign as the local Chelish sailors are too afraid of it to speak its name. Those who must cross the region do so by a road that runs parallel to the gulf. It is believed that this coastline was created by the cataclysmic events of [[Earthfall]] in [[-5293 AR]].
