> The **Burning Cape**, sometimes called the **Burning Coast**, is on the eastern coast of [[Osirion]], north of the [[Scorpion Coast]] and south of the [[Gardens of Shepeska]]. This rocky stretch of the coast was so named because it appears to be aflame when the morning [[Sun|sun]] hits the coast from the east. The coast is littered with skeletons of ancient [[Ship|ships]] from all over the world that tried to locate the secret sea-lanes of [[Shotep-Kara]]. The waters are dangerous and the area's haunted reputation prevented rescue vessels from coming to provide aid. Despite the danger, the area attracts treasure hunters and [[Urgathoa|Urgathoan]] cultists who believe their goddess sustains the [[Undead|undead]] sailors of these ancient ships. Despite the danger, a profitable trade route currently traverses the **Burning Cape**.
