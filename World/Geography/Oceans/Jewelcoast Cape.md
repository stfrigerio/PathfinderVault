> **Jewelcoast Cape** is a rocky peninsula that juts from the southern coast of [[Cheliax]] into the [[Inner Sea]]. To its east lies [[Gemcrown Bay]] and the old capital of [[Westcrown]], while to the northeast lie the [[Cliffs of Fury]]. Despite its attractive name, no settlements of any size can be found along Jewelcoast Cape.
