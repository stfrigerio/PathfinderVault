> The mile-wide rift known as the **Endless Gulf** is one of the most infamous areas of the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Sekamina]]. Located far beneath north-western [[Andoran]] below the [[Candlestone Caverns]], this canyon begins beneath the [[Nar-Voth]] city of the [[Court of Ether]] and stretches all the way down to the [[Midnight Mountains]] in [[Orv]].



## Geography

> The rift plunges thousands of feet all the way down through Sekamina, finally opening out into the vault of Orv known as the Midnight Mountains. Its nearly shear walls make exploration of the Endless Gulf a tricky prospect, although thousands of passages and caverns honeycomb its walls. At one time, a number of rock bridges linked the sides of the Gulf, but these were destroyed by the [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] in order to make it more difficult for the Gulf's denizens to spread to other areas.


## Inhabitants

> A vast number of stalactites grow down from the ceiling above the rift, and here the [[Dark fey|dark fey]] have built a hanging city known as the Court of Ether. The dark fey inhabitants of the Court include [[Gremlin|gremlins]], [[Mite|mites]], [[Redcap|redcaps]], and [[Pixie|pixies]]. They can sometimes be found riding specially bred [[Stirge|stirges]], and there have also been sightings of [[Gryph|gryphs]]. Further down, there are colonies of [[Doombat|doombats]], [[Mobat|mobats]], [[Roper|ropers]], and [[Cave fisher|cave fishers]]. The svirfneblin and their [[Xorn|xorn]] and other allies maintain a cautious watch on the Court of Ether.


### Dire corbies

> The best known rookery of [[Dire corby|dire corbies]] make their home here, made more dangerous by the leadership of an exiled [[Harpy|harpy]] called [[Nevaki]]. The harpy is using captives as slave labour to try and build a number of rickety rope bridges to span the Gulf. There are hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of dire corbies under her rule, in addition to Nevaki's deformed, flightless offspring who retain their mother's siren call.
