> **Cape Almhult** is a piece of land jutting off of the [[Crown of the World]], the southern tip of a subcontinent separated from the main landmass by the [[Gulf of Svallmundr]] and bounded to the north by the [[Hellrung Mountains]]. A colony of [[Ulfen]] settlers, also known as [[Almhult]], ekes out a living on the cape. Cape Almhult lies between the Gulf of Svallmundr to the north and the [[Steaming Sea]] to the south. During the long arctic winter, pack ice from [[Whitefang Bay]] often extends as far south as the cape.
