> The ***True Seal of Sulesh*** is a powerful [[Genie seal|genie seal]] created by legendary [[Genie binder]] [[Sulesh the Great]]. Unlike other genie seals, the True Seal can be removed from one container and affixed to another. Though Sulesh created many seals, he could never replicate the power and potency of his True Seal
