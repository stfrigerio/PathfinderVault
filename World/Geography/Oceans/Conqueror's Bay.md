 Conqueror's Bay is the large body of water in the upper part of this picture of the city of Korvosa.
> **Conqueror's Bay** is a large inlet of the [[Arcadian Ocean]] that straddles southern [[Varisia]] and northern [[Nidal]]. The easternmost part of the bay punches deeper into southern Varisia, and stretches approximately 45 miles from the mouth of the [[Jeggare River]] and the city of [[Korvosa]] to the town of [[Veldraine]]. At the mouth of this smaller inlet, a giant chain spans the ocean floor from Veldraine to a basalt shelf opposite the town. This chain can be pulled tight by a series of massive winches to prevent passage into or out of the smaller bay.
