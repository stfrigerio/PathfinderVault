**Season 10** of the [[Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild]] campaign runs from August 2018 to July 2019. The season is referred to as the **Season of the Ten**.


## Metaplot and ongoing plots overview

> The [[Hao Jin Tapestry]] was recovered by the [[Pathfinder Society]] during [[Year of the Ruby Phoenix]], a fantastical tapestry containing a [[Demiplane|demiplane]]. The tapestry became a favorite artifact of the society, who would use the tapestry as a conduit for rapid travel across [[Golarion]] and would launch many missions to catalogue the wonder of the tapestry's inner world. Recent investigations reveal that the tapestry is in critical condition and constant decline. If the society does not act quickly to repair it, the demiplane will rip apart spilling its contents into the Astral Plane. To save the tapestry, Agents must do what they do best to save lives, preserve history, and track down the ancient scholar who understands the tapestryâ€™s structure. 
> The tapestry is not the only mission this year. Agents will track down relics from the Shining Crusade against the infamous lich Tar Baphon, receive a transformative blessing from a demigod, and prevent a powerful demon from capitalizing on the collapsing Worldwound to rise as a new demon lord. 
> Meanwhile, the [[Decemvirate]], the Society's ten leaders who work cloaked in masks that obscure their identities from even the strongest of magic, face exposure or exploitation the [[Shadow Lodge faction|Shadow Lodges]] [[Grandmaster Torch]] finally gets his hands on a list of names of the Decemvirateâ€™s members.
