> The **Dismal Nitch** is the name given to the [[Arcadian Ocean]] coastline southwest of [[Vyre Island]] off the northwestern coast of [[Ravounel]]. It borders [[Nisroch Bay]] to the east and [[Cape Dis]] to the west, and is populated by [[Aquatic elf|aquatic elves]]. Furthermore, few travel to or near the Dismal Nitch as dangerous reefs hinder sea traffic and people tell of the waters being haunted.
