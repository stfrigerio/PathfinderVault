> The large inlet known as **Aspo Bay** lies along the coastlines of southwestern [[Andoran]] and southeastern [[Cheliax]] on the [[Inner Sea]]. Both the Andoren towns of [[Augustana]] and [[Chimera Cove]] and the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Ostenso]] are built along it. Aspo Bay is also home to countless small fishing villages, along with the ruins of many small Chelish naval bases, which dot its western islands and crags. The most well-known of these is [[Selian's Watch|Selians Watch]].
