> The **Gulf of Accord** is a small bay on the southeastern shore of [[Lake Encarthan]], bordering the mercantile nation of [[Druma]]. The Drumish river known as [[Profit's Flow|Profits Flow]] empties into the bay, and the cities of [[Detmer]], [[Twingate]], and the Drumish capital [[Kerse]] are all located on it. The bay is heavily patrolled by the Drumish navy out of the city of Detmer, who try to keep out smugglers, pirates, refugees, and other ne'er-do-wells.
