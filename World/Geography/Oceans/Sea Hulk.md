> The **Sea Hulk** rests only a short distance from the southern coast of the [[Isle of Kortos]], halfway between [[Absalom]] and [[Diobel]]. This ever-shifting mass of wrecked sailing vessels, kraken-weed, and crystal coral plays host to [[Shark|sharks]] and sand demons, yet neither these hazards nor the ever-present threat of running aground on the hidden detritus keeps treasure hunters and [[Pirate|pirates]] from the treacherous mess.
