> The **Lost Coast Road** is a variably-maintained [[Varisia|Varisian]] road which originates in the city of [[Magnimar]]: it exits the city at the gate on the border between the [[Alabaster District|Alabaster]] and the [[Naos]] districts of the city. The road generally runs north along the coast, passing through the town of [[Sandpoint]] and, eventually, terminates at [[Windsong Abbey]].  Although the road travels through countryside that is is wild and lonely, there are small inns placed a day's journey apart which provide shelter and protection for travelers.  Small shrines to the goddess [[Desna]] can be found along its length as well, and act as informal places of worship and as refuges for those trapped in Varisia's frequent rain storms.  Most of the traffic on the road is south of Sandpoint; the section of the Lost Coast Road north of town to Windsong Abbey is much less traveled.
