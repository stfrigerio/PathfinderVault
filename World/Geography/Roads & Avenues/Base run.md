> The **base run** of [[Citadel Vraid]] is a narrow pathway which provides an alternative passage between the three bastions of the citadel. The base run begins from [[Paralictors' Keep|Paralictors Keep]] in [[Bastion Dominus]] and runs across the cliff face, connecting to the northeastern tower of [[Bastion Tyrannous]] and continuing to the huge gate of [[Bastion Ferox]].
