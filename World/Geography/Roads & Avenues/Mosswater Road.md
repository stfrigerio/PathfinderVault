> The **Mosswater Road** to the west of the village of [[Thornkeep]] in the [[River Kingdoms]] leads to the ruins of [[Mosswater]] and the banks of the [[West Sellen River]]. Ten miles west of Thornkeep, the Mosswater Road intersects the Valley Road which is used as a section of the [[Crusader Road]] due to Mosswater's destruction. At the intersection of the Mosswater Road and the Valley Road stands a small inn and taproom known as Alejia's Crossing. Through the Mosswater Road and the Valley Road, Thornkeep is linked with [[Fort Inevitable]] to the south and [[Fort Riverwatch]] to the north.
