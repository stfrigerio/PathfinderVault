> [[Isger]]'s **Conerica Straits** are an important trade route stretching from [[Cheliax]] in the southwest to [[Druma]] in the northeast. It consists of a network of roads near the [[Conerica River]] with the Isgeri capital of [[Elidir]] in the center. Isger has a reputation for having more gold pass through its borders than anywhere else in [[Avistan]], and most of it is due to the Straits.
> Isger's army, severely weakened by the [[Goblinblood Wars]], protects the Straits but is unable to defend the rest of the country.
