> **Ravounel Road** is the busiest entry road for the city of [[Kintargo]] via the heavily trafficked [[Rust Gate]]. While there are two other roads—the [[Night Road]] connecting with [[Nidal]]; and the [[Silver Road]] connecting with the rest of [[Cheliax]]—the Ravounel Road connects Kintargo with the rest of the [[Archduchy of Ravounel]] and, thus, sees the majority of land traffic.
