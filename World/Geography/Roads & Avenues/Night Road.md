> The **Night Road** links the city of [[Kintargo]] with its northern trading partner, the shadowy nation of [[Nidal]]. The road runs from Kintargo's northern [[Villegre]] district, exiting the city via the [[Nightways Gate]], then follows Ravounel's northeast coast via [[Cypress Point]] all the way into Nidal itself at Thrune's Chance.  It is an awkward trading relationship as most Kintargans do not enjoy having the sinister Nidalese for partners yet, due to overland distance, it is easier to trade with Nidal than it is with the rest of [[Cheliax]]. The Nidalese, however, see this as an opportunity to strengthen their influence on Chelish culture.
