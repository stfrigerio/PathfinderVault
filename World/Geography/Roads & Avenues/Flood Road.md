> The **Flood Road** is a highway of cracked mud for most of the year that runs roughly parallel to the [[Tusk Mountains]]. It begins south of the town of [[Hillcross]] in the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] and runs in a southerly direction past the [[Algid Wastes]], east of the [[Orc|orc]] city of [[Wyvernsting]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]], between the eastern [[Kodar Mountains]] and the Tusk Mountains, through the capital city of [[Urgir]], and ends at the [[River Esk]].


## Road or River?

> The name Flood Road is a misleading title since it is only actually a road for 10 months of the year. For the other two months it is a muddy deluge fed by the spring melt from the Tusk Mountains, further to the north in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. The flood road is nonetheless the lifeblood of the Hold of Belkzen, as it the main trade route between Wyvernsting and Urgir.  It also provides access to the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, and many caravans head up the Flood Road in an attempt to capture the strange megafauna of that distant realm. When the Flood Road floods, the water from the Tusk Mountains help rejuvenate the land, but can be dangerous to anyone traveling the road, as it travels in a devastating flash flood. This event also heralds the coming of herds of migratory [[Aurochs|aurochs]] and a time of relative plenty across Belkzen, known as the Flood Truce. It is one of the few times when there is regular peace between the feuding orc tribes.
