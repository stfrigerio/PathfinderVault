> The **Avenue of Arms** is a bizarre landmark of the city of [[Korvosa|Korvosas]] [[North Point]] district. The avenue stretches along the [[Jeggare River|riverfront]] between the [[Great Tower]] and the Burnt Bridge Boulevard. 127 stone arms sprout from the ground, each exactly two feet, three and a half inches apart. No two arms look the same, with three-quarters of them appearing male, and the other quarter female. Around a third are empty, another third hold stone [[Weapon|weapons]], and the final third grip ancient rusted weaponry, but other than this, the arms show no signs of age or weathering. The Avenue of Arms predates the arrival of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] settlers but no one can say by how long.
