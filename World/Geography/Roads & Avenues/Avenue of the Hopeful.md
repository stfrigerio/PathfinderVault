> The **Avenue of the Hopeful** is a winding street in [[Absalom|Absaloms]] [[Ascendant Court]] and a busy market catering to those fascinated by the [[Test of the Starstone]]: hopefuls, followers, worshippers, and the merchants, pickpockets, and charlatans who hope to make [[Money|money]] from them. Some of the sincere hopefuls have lived on the street for years, while others are merely confidence men. Merchants offer [[Holy symbol|holy symbols]], [[Holy water|holy water]], and relics, as well as "faith papers", which indicate the popularity of a hopeful [[Deity|deity]]. The booth of the Masked God of Secrets, a presumed hopeful, is a front for an organization that collects and sells secrets.
