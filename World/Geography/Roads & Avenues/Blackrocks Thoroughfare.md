> **Blackrocks Thoroughfare** is one of the few broad and paved streets through the lower class neighborhood of [[Mugget]] in [[Almas]] [[Tamuth District]]. It begins at the main stockyard in the southeastern corner of Mugget and crosses over [[Balmore's Canal|Balmores Canal]] before moving into [[Smithtown]]. The cobbles of Blackrocks Thoroughfare in Mugget are often slick with gore from the neighborhood's meat-processing industry, and the raised paving stones on the edge of the road help the butchers funnel the offal and blood away from their doorsteps. The road is heavily used by covered mule carts during the day that carry [[Animal|animal]] carcasses and skins between the various businesses, while the smell of boiling lye and burning alkali from the tanneries chokes the air.
