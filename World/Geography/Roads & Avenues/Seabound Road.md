> The **Seabound Road** runs between the prosperous trade port of [[Golquila]] and the mountain city of [[Ukhrul]]. The Seabound Road was instrumental in bringing greater prosperity to the once desolate [[Western Ghats]] region of [[Vudra]]. Before the Seabound Road's creation the area was primarily settled by [[Ysoki|ratfolk]] who tunnelled beneath the rugged heights of the [[Johar Mountains]].
