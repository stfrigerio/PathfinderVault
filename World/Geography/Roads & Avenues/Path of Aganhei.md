> The **Path of Aganhei** is the primary route bridging [[Tian Xia]] and [[Avistan]] across the [[Crown of the World]]. The path was first charted by the [[Tian human ethnicityTian-Min|Tian-Min]] explorer Amatatsu Aganhei around [[1300 AR]]. Though his maps were thought destroyed, they resurfaced around [[4300 AR]], leading to dramatically increased trade between the two continents. Despite its many dangers, the Path is a valuable trade route, although completing it requires the aid of skilled guides.
> The Path is actually two overlapping trade routes, one connecting the [[Successor States]] of [[Lung Wa]] with the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] and the [[Sellen Passage]], the other carrying travelers from [[Minkai]] to the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. This latter road begins in [[Hongal]] in Tian Xia, crossing the [[Wall of Heaven]] through the [[Altan Zuud]], climbs the [[High Ice]] at [[Ovorikheer Pass]], descends back to the [[Outer Rim]] at [[Koumssa Gap]], and enjoys relative safety as it passes through [[Hasanaliat]] and [[Urjuk]] before climbing the [[Rimethirst Mountains]]. From there it branches, crossing the [[Stormspear Hills]] and ending at [[Kalsgard]] in the west and running through miles of tundra toward [[Icestair]] in the east.
