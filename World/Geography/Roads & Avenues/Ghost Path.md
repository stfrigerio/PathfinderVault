> The **Ghost Path** is a semi-legendary pathway that leads from [[Minkai]] down into the depths of the  [[Darklands]]. The Ghost Path is a series of ledges and caves that lead from an extinguished caldera on [[Mount Kumijinja]] in the [[Ikkaku Peninsula]] into [[Sekamina]]. The Ghost Path ends in an immense shaft that is the only place in the whole of Sekamina that is exposed to direct [[Sun|sunlight]].
> In [[470 AR]], [[Ishanda Aiko|General Ishanda Aiko]] of the [[Teikoku|Teikoku Shogunate]] led an expedition along the Ghost Path. There were almost no survivors after Ishanda's army stumbled upon the outskirts of the [[Oni|oni]] city of [[Shirogoku]].
