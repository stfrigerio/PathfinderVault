> The **Barren Wood** is the name of the [[Abyssal realm]] of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Mestama]]. It is a bleak and desolate coniferous forest where the fir and pine trees are dying or already dead. It is inhabited by castrated [[Demon|demons]]; flocks of fiendish [[Raven|ravens]] and crows; and [[Hag|hags]] and [[Witch|witches]] who live in broken down houses, attempting to trap travellers. In deeper areas of the Wood, even darker Abyssal creatures roam.
> It is thought dark and remote forests of [[Golarion]] may connect to the Barren Wood, especially those in [[Nidal]], [[Taldor]] and [[Galt]]; certainly some who have wandered into those dark forests have never been seen again.
