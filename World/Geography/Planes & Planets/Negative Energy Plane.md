> The **Negative Energy Plane**â€”also known as **the Void**, **Entropy's Heart**, the **Nothing**, and the **Final End**â€”sits at the [[Metaphysical|metaphysical]] center of the [[Shadow Plane]], in much of the same way as the [[Positive Energy Plane]] does for the [[Material Plane]]. The [[Plane|plane]] is considered to be the polar opposite of the Positive Energy Plane in the [[Arcane tradition|arcane tradition]] and complementary in the [[Esoteric tradition|esoteric tradition]].
> It is a place of annihilation and destruction, leaching life energy from all who come near it. A barren wasteland of emptiness with few surfaces, the Negative Energy Plane is the home of countless [[Undead|undead creatures]], many of them intelligent and extremely powerful. In fact, the plane is the source from which all undead draw their power and un-life.



## Properties

 The Negative and Positive Energy Planes, at top left, in the context of the [[River of Souls]].
> The plane is saturated with [[Negative energy|negative energy]] that drains life from beings that rely on [[Positive energy|positive energy]], including [[Mortal|mortals]], within moments; most who arrive without [[Magic|magical]] protection or planar attunement immediately turn to ash and become [[Wraith|wraiths]]. Food and natural materials, such as mundane cloth and leather, rot immediately, and [[Metal|metal]] rusts away within days. It is inherently darkâ€”natural light sources go out on their ownâ€”and frigid. [[Gravity]] is subjective and directional, but movement is a matter of will more than physical force.
> [[Holy]] power and magical light tend to attract the attention of the plane's resident undead. Closer to the plane's heart, negative energy consolidates into twisted obsidian-like crystals.


## Geography

> The plane mostly consists of bleak emptiness. The few exceptions include elemental pockets, where the plane intersects with the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]], as well as a number of unique features.

> - The Escarpment, cliffs on its metaphorical edge near the Material Plane where material worlds abut the Nothing. Cataracts of liquid entropy pour over parts of these cliffs, while the higher peaks are home to powerful [[Outsider|outsiders]].
> - Chasm to Shadow, manifesting its border with the [[Shadow Plane]] as an impossibly deep ravine filled with shadows. The mixture of shadow and entropy produces a powerful, almost sentient malice that attracts passing [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]], drawing them into the Chasm's depths where they transform into [[Nightshade|nightshades]].
> - Floating Islands rent from the Escarpment by erosion, float into the void until they eventually crumble away and are often claimed by powerful beings.
> - An array of [[Planet|planets]] consumed by the void, including [[Fallen Duromak]], known as the [[Dead Worlds]] and haunted by the undead.
> - Crystalline knots of negative energy that are home to, and birth, the [[Sceaduinar|sceaduinars]].
> - [[Dawn spiral|Dawn spirals]], termini of [[Black hole|black holes]] in the Material Plane, formed by fragments of matter drawn through the celestial bodies.
> - Entropy sheets that manifest pure destruction and which often obscure ancient monuments and sealed [[Gate|gates]].

## Inhabitants

![[Nightskitter.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A [[Nightskitter|nightskitter]], a type of nightshade.
> Incorporeal undead creatures, including the plane's most feared [[Nightshade|nightshades]], dominate the plane. Corporeal undead, such as [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|liches]] and [[Graveknight|graveknights]], also travel to the plane and meet or reside in protected settlements like [[Malikar's Keep|Malikars Keep]].
> The most prominent natives of the plane are sceaduinars and [[Sceazir|sceazirs]], who spawn from crystalline knots of negative energy that form strange angles. [[Oblivion|Oblivions]] also coalesce from the entropy that courses through the plane.
> Other beings who visit or live in the plane include [[Daemon|daemons]], at least one [[Danava|danava]], [[Devourer|devourers]], [[Hundun|hunduns]], [[Umbral dragon|umbral dragons]], and void-ravaged survivors who have acclimated to the void. A few [[Movanic deva|movanic devas]] voluntarily brave the plane as front-line defenses against its inhabitants.
