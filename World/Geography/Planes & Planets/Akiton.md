 First contact on Akiton.


## Description

> Red in color, Akiton is both colder and harder than its sunward neighbor. Geographically, its surface is dominated by sparse deserts and glaciers, many of which are dried-up former ocean beds; its mountains and chasms are respectively the solar system's tallest and deepest. Akitonians favor [[Firearm|firearms]], which have exceptional range thanks to its thin atmosphere and low gravity.

## Rune representation

> In scholarly works, Akiton is sometimes represented by a rune: a circle with four 'L' shaped prongs at each diagonal making an approximation of a four-legged beetle.


## Inhabitants

> While home to a wide variety of life, both intelligent and not, the primary inhabitants of the Red Planet are the tribal [[Shobhad|shobhads]], four-armed men standing twelve feet in height and capable of wielding a sword in each of their four hands. They share the world with the timid and crafty [[Ysoki]] [[Ratfolk|ratfolk]] and [[Ikeshti]] the red-skinned [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] who hunt the great sand serpents of Akiton's dried sea beds with only primitive or natural weapons. The [[Contemplatives of Ashok]] are perhaps the strangest inhabitants of Akiton, even among the panoply of alien beings who live on the world, and their soft and throbbing brain-sacs provide them an unnatural connection to the facts of the distant past and future.
> Other life on Akiton includes:

> - Arabuk: cold-climate ferocious beasts
> - [[Akiton humanoid|red-skinned humanoids]] similar to Golarion's [[Human|humans]]
> - [[Behir|Behirs]]
> - [[Death worm|Death worms]] called great sand worms
> - [[Elder thing|Elder things]], especially common at the south pole
> - [[Girallon|Girallons]]: very common and may have originated on Akiton as a species
> - Ice Clan humans
> - ghostly khulan
> - great sand serpents
> - [[Shoggoth|Shoggoths]], especially common at the south pole
> - [[Witchwyrd|Witchwyrds]] once lived on Akiton but few, if any, reside there today. Their racial ancestors split into two types: witchwyrds and shobhads

## Satellites

> Akiton has no known satellites.


## Links to Golarion

> - The Contemplatives created a permanent, but flawed, link between Akiton and Golarion. At the Golarion end it appears as a ring of crimson stone; this ring is in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] and is known as the [[Doorway to the Red Star]].
> - Arl is secretly linked to the [[Maze of the Open Road]] in [[Galt]].
> - Akiton (along with [[Castrovel]] and Golarion's eccentric orbit) exhibit a strange influence over the floor of [[Lake Nirthran]] in the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Sekamina]], causing it to buckle up near the lake's center. This has an influence on the tides of the Dying Sea that are not fully understood by scholars.
