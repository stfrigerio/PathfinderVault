> **Charnelhome** is the name of the [[Abyssal realm]] of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Shax]].


## Description

> The realm is a vast, city-sized house raised above a huge bog filled with vicious, carnivorous plants. Within the house, every room is either guarded by a monster or filled with a trap. Many of Shax's prisoners are tormented by being placed in the house while Shax watches their attempts at escape; this helps him to improve his methods of killing. Sometimes Shax himself will disguise himself as a fellow victim to sadistically feel the fear of his prisoner's at close hand.


## Inhabitants

> In addition to Shax's many prisoners, [[Thoxel|thoxel]] [[Demon|demons]] are commonly found within Charnelhome. Many fights break out amongst the thoxels and other servants of Shax, including [[Babau|babaus]] and [[Choker|chokers]], with all his servants desperately trying to prove that they are Shax's best servants.
