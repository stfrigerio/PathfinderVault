A map of the River of Souls. Click the image for a detailed legend.
> The **River of Souls** is the name given to the constant migration of [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Soul|souls]] from the [[Material Plane]] to [[Pharasma|Pharasmas]] [[Boneyard]] in the [[Outer Sphere]], where they are judged and sent to their eternal fate.



## Passage

*For the passage of souls from creation to birth, see [[SoulCreation and birth|Soul]].*
> Once detached from their mortal vessels, souls pass through the [[Ethereal Plane]], joining each other on their way to the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]], then out of the [[Inner Sphere]] and into the [[Astral Plane]]. Souls then form the titular river, where they are watched over by countless representatives from the Outer Sphere, such as [[Angel|angels]], [[Devil|devils]], and [[Demon|demons]]. These forces attempt to protect the souls in transit from malicious forces, as most souls are destined to become [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] who join and empower these guardians' home [[Plane|planes]]. The river ends in the Boneyard, where Pharasma judges the souls and dispatches them to a compatible Outer Plane or shuttles them on toward some other fate.


### Dangers

*For other fates of souls outside of the River of Souls, see [[SoulExceptions|Soul]].*
> Souls in their migration generally have little to fear on their journey, watched over as they are by powerful entities from the various planes. The two exceptions to this come from [[Night hag|night hags]] and the much more dangerous [[Astradaemon|astradaemons]]. The former travel to the Astral from their homes on the [[Ethereal Plane]] and are always in search of souls to steal and sell to the highest bidder on the Lower Planes. The latter constantly hunt for souls to consume and take back to their masters on [[Abaddon]].


### Appearance

> On the Astral Plane, the River of Souls appears from a distance like a massive, winding silver thread. Those who approach can see the countless souls moving through a silver haze, like so many schools of fish. The [[Esoteric tradition|esoteric tradition]] considers the River of Souls to be a [[Ley line|ley line]], and simply one part of the multiverse's network of magical pathways.
