> The **Palace of Nightmares** is a city-sized [[Demiplane|demiplane]] within the [[Ethereal Plane]] and the stronghold of the powerful [[Kimenhul|kimenhul]] [[Sahkil|sahkil]] [[Thassritoum]].



## Geography

> Visitors to the Palace of Nightmares arrive at the Absence Loggia, a covered porch larger than a city block. Charm and creativity might earn passage into the Conservatory of Sobs, the Bleating Chapel, and the Reflecting Pool before one is allowed into the Parlor of Lamentation, Thassritoum's courtroom.


## Properties

> [[Magic/Conjuration]] and [[Magic/Evocation|evocation]] do not work at all in the Palace of Nightmares, while physical violence inflicts only pain, not injury.


## Inhabitants

> Within the Palace of Nightmares, Thassritoum gathers lesser [[Sahkil|sahkils]], other [[Evil|evil]] [[Outsider|outsiders]] and [[Petitioner|petitioners]] alike. The palace has its own social circles, etiquette, and pecking order based on loathsome gifts and fears. The Absence Loggia is lined with grotesque entertainers, desperate courtiers, and pedlars of pain and dread. Only the most depraved or deceitful [[Mortal|mortals]] are welcome into the Parlor of Lamentation, where sahkils, [[Daemon|daemons]], [[Devil|devils]] and [[Demon|demons]] offer dreadful memories and broken mortal lives in an attempt to court Thassritoum's approval.
> Thassritoum has also kidnapped the [[Yamaraj|yamaraj]] [[Psychopomp|psychopomp]] Harubic, whom Thassritoum forces to watch parading petitioners and outsiders condemned to afterlives broken by the sahkils, in the hope of breaking Harubic's confidence in its judgements. Thassritoum is also served by some powerful minions: the Dancers, a pair of [[Pakalchi|pakalchis]] stitched together into one creature; the Lucid Rani, a [[Vudra|Vudrani]] [[Psychic|psychic]] killed by Thassritoum through fear and turned into a [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]]; Spawn Without End, a [[Xill|xill]] whose eggs degrade the victim's sanity without ever hatching; and Nandrahl, Thassritoum's former [[Grim reaper|grim reaper]] lover.
