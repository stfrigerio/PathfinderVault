> The **Plateau of Leng** is a distant [[Demiplane|demiplane]] of nightmares within the [[Dreamlands]], barely known to even the greatest scholars of the [[Great Beyond]] on [[Golarion]].



## Geography

> Leng is accessible from virtually anywhere via the Dreamlands. Those who travel too far into the realm of dreams can find themselves caught in a vast sea and carried by the tides to the [[Dreaming Shore]], the southern edge of Leng.
> Leng is a cold, desolate, inhospitable realm hedged in by two titanic mountain ranges that run from the Dreaming Shore and converge at the [[Cold Waste]] in the north. The plateau rises ever upward as it travels away from the rocky coast, but no two travellers describe the lay of the land identically. Upon the tableland sit numerous scattered stone villages, both inhabited and ruined. The greatest of these ruins is the abandoned city of [[Sarkomand]], the original home of the [[Denizen of Leng|denizens of Leng]]. Two stairways descend from Sarkomand to the cyclopean underworld of Leng.


## Inhabitants

> Leng is home to creatures that defy facile categorization or even understanding. The primary inhabitants of Leng are the mysterious denizens of Leng, who ply the Dreaming Shore to prey upon those seeking to escape Leng by sea. Denizens of Leng also travel to the Dreamlands and the [[Material Plane]] in their strange [[Ship|ships]] to collect [[Slavery|slaves]]. Many of these slaves are sent to the almost-humans' [[Moon-beast|moon-beast]] masters on the [[Nameless Rock]], to be sacrificed in their foul [[Ritual|rituals]].
> In some villages, like [[Lelag-Leng]], degenerate beings resembling [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] [[Human|humans]] perform profane rites of worship to blasphemous [[Deities|deities]], which are malicious enough to shatter the mind of onlookers. [[Nightgaunt|Nightgaunts]] and [[Leng hound|Leng hounds]] roam the skies of Leng, hunting prey for their masters. The underworld of Leng is home to the titanic [[Bhole|bholes]], and the [[Leng ghoul|Leng ghouls and ghasts]] who are far more powerful than normal [[Ghoul|ghouls]] and locked in a war against the four-armed [[Gug|gugs]].
> In the Spider Vales nestled in the mountains, the massive [[Leng spider|Leng spiders]] plot their revenge against the denizens of Leng, who were responsible for driving them nearly to extinction, and eagerly prey upon any trespassers. [[Scarlet walker|Scarlet walkers]] also lurk in the mountains, feeding on living creatures.
> Others include the [[Dragon|draconic]] monstrosities called [[Shantak|shantaks]] and the infamous [[Hound of Tindalos|hounds of Tindalos]].
> The most powerful being in Leng, perhaps its ruler, is the mysterious yellow-clad [[High-Priest Not To Be Described]], who presides over the plateau's culture of blood sacrifice.
> The true horror of Leng lies at the central peak where the mountains meet. Beyond the Cold Waste, a row of malevolent statues known as the Watchers in the Waste stand guard over an impossibly-high mountain, atop of which lies unknown [[Kadath]], which reaches a further several miles above the mountain's peak, and where the [[Outer God]] [[Nyarlathotep]] rules.


## On Golarion

> The [[Runelords|runelords]] of [[Thassilon]] were aware of Leng and often [[Magic/Conjuration|conjured]] its inhabitants to do their bidding; [[Karzoug]] the Claimer even built his capital, [[Xin-Shalast]], in a location where the border between Leng and the Material Plane was unusually thin to take advantage of the dimension's eldritch energies.
> Knowledge of Leng on Golarion is sketchy at best, limited to glimpses in nightmares and [[Drug|drug]]-fueled visions and its origin is unknown. Some believe it to exist physically on the Material Plane or another dimension. Others claim it is a surviving piece of a dead plane from before the current [[Multiverse|multiverse]]. Yet others believe that Leng is the nightmares of [[Mortal|mortal]] dreamers shaped into a physical place.
