> The **Pyramid of An-Hepsu XI** is the tomb of the [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich]] [[Pharaoh]] [[An-Hepsu XI]], who was overthrown by his terrified subjects after his transformation into a lich. Since they were unable to truly destroy him, An-Hepsu XI's killers hid his body parts in different parts of his pyramid, then sealed the entire pyramid in a [[Demiplane|demiplane]] strongly connected to the [[Positive Energy Plane]] to weaken his [[Undead|undead]] powers, except for the entrance, hidden deep in the [[Pillars of the Sun]], a mountain range in [[Osirion]]. Its guardians are equally devoted to repelling thieves and preventing the Lich Pharaoh's return, including a group of [[Archon|archons]] and [[Angel|angels]] led by the [[Solar|solar]] Mytreael, who sealed themselves in the pyramid and drive away all intruders, [[Good|good]] or [[Evil|evil]], lest they fall under An-Hepsu XI's fell influence.
