*This article discusses the [[Elemental Plane|elemental plane]]. For the [[Planet|planet]], see [[Earth]].*
> The **Elemental Plane of Earth**, the **Eternal Delve**, is located within the [[Inner Sphere]], between the [[Plane of Water]] and the [[Plane of Fire]]. It is a realm of seemingly endless rock riddled with caverns, some of them the size of entire planets.



## Ruler

 The [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] of Ayrzul.
> The ruler of the Elemental Plane of Earth is [[Ayrzul]], the Fossilized King.


## Geography

> This plane is composed primarily of rock and earth, criss-crossed by veins of precious [[Metal|metal]] and [[Gemstone|gemstones]] of such gigantic proportions that they cannot be believed by those who have never set foot there. Interspersed with this solid rock and earth are caverns of all sizes, some of them dark and dry, others filled with water and phosphorescent [[Fungus|fungus]]. Others yet are lit by enormous crystals, [[Enchanted|enchanted]] by the native [[Shaitan|shaitan]] [[Genie|genies]] to illuminate vast caves, like miniature [[Sun|suns]].
> Intrusions of elemental fire and water extend from the Plane of Earth's borders with the other elemental planes: bodies of magma and volcanic tunnels extend from the Plane of Fire, while the influence of the Plane of Water results in vast buried oceans and in bodies of limestone and [[Salt|salt]]. A tunnel known as the Vent extends through the Plane of Earth from its border with Fire on one side to that with Water on the other.


## Inhabitants

> The Plane of Earth is home to the mighty mercantile empires of the shaitan genies, who freely trade the incredible mineral wealth of their home to [[Planar|planar]] travelers or the migrating nations of [[Janni|janni]] merchants. Also found in the plane are the haunts of the [[Crystal dragon|crystal dragons]], a native race of [[Dragon|dragons]] who fiercely guard their treasures and are often found ruling small nations of other species, providing safety from the slavery common in the shaitans' empire. [[Xiomorn|Xiomorns]] control large sections of the plane, and themselves pay obeisance to Ayrzul. [[Earth elemental|Earth elementals]] are much more protective of the plane's mineral riches, seeing its dispersal as an almost personal violation of their bodies.
> Other native life in the Endless Delve includes [[Earth mephit|earth]] and [[Dust mephit|dust mephits]], [[Mud elemental|mud elementals]], [[Xorn|xorn]], [[Crysmal|crysmals]] and the serpentine [[Agrawgh|agrawghs]], whose tunneling is thought to have created many of the Plane of Earth's tunnels. Species more common on other planes, such as [[Oread|oreads]], [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[Human|humans]] and the occasional [[Elf|elves]], can be found inhabiting larger caverns and hollow spaces. [[Magma elemental|Magma elementals]], [[Magma ooze|magma oozes]] and the huge, wormlike [[Thoqqua|thoqquas]] live along the Plane of Earth's border with the Plane of Fire.
