![[Dream_voyage.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Shardra Geltl]], [[Sajan Gadadvara]], and [[Rivani]] sail on a strange [[Ship|ship]] in a *dream voyage* through the [[Dreamlands]].
> A **dreamscape** is a realm within the [[Dreamlands]] similar to a [[Demiplane|demiplane]], and is created by a sleeping [[Mortal|mortal]] creature; this creature is typically the only creature who can naturally access it. A dreamer inhabits a dreamscape through a **lucid body**, a type of avatar. Due to the vast array of mortal life in the [[Multiverse|multiverse]] capable of experiencing dreams, the Dreamlands can contain an almost countless array of independent dreamscapes.



## Planar traits

> Due to the unusual [[Dimension|dimensional]] behavior of the Dreamlands and its existence within the [[Ethereal Plane]], a dreamscape can be considered to be coexistent with all other [[Plane|planes]].
> Each dreamscape has its own planar traits, which can include properties of physics such as [[Gravity|gravity]] and [[Time|time]]. The perceived passing of a single day in most dreamscapes consumes an hour in the [[Material Plane]].
> A lucid body can attempt extraordinary acts within a dreamscape that they could not accomplish in the Material Plane, such as casting powerful [[Spell|spells]] or wielding legendary [[Magic item|magic items]].


## Access

> Aside from entering a dreamscape through a naturally occurring dream, existing dreamscapes can also be accessed through specialized [[Magic|magic]] spells and powers, such as *dream travel*. Accessing someone else's dream is a more difficult task of [[Planar travel|planar travel]] than accessing the more stable [[Dreamlands]], which itself is more difficult than traveling to other standalone planes.
> [[Animate dream|Animate dreams]] are creatures that escaped from dreamscapes and often inhabit the Ethereal Plane.


### Dreamthieves

> A dreamthief is a [[Rogue|rogue]] whose [[Soul|soul]] contains a dreamshard of concentrated emotion that grants them supernatural access to others' dreamscapes, and can manifest and then steal those creatures' own emotions. They can also dream lucidly.


## Known dreamscapes

> - [[Leng]], an unusually stable dreamscape that became a demiplane accessible through specially tuned planar tuning forks
