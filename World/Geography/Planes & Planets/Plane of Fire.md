> The **Elemental Plane of Fire**, the **Eternal Furnace**, is the outermost of the [[Elemental Plane|elemental planes]], encircling the [[Plane of Earth]] to one side, and bordering the [[Astral Plane]] to the other. It is a realm of vast, liquid oceans of flame, charred cinderlands, and flowing rivers of magma.



## Ruler

 The [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] of Ymeri.
> The ruler of the Elemental Plane of Fire is [[Ymeri]], Queen of the Inferno.


## Geography

> Of all the [[Elemental Plane|elemental planes]], the Plane of Fire is generally the most hostile to [[Mortal|mortal]] life. It is a landscape of white hot heat, with rivers and seas of fire, lava and molten [[Metal|metal]], mountains of compacted ash, and burning skies filled with smoke and curtains of flame.


## Locations


### City of Brass

***Main article: [[City of Brass]]***
> The City of Brass is one of the most well-known settlements in the [[Great Beyond]]. Constructed on enormous brass plates which float suspended on a sea of fire, it is a place of byzantine courtly intrigues and deadly dangers, but also serves as one of the easiest locations for outsiders to the plane to gather information and conduct business. The city (and by extension, all efreet) were ruled by the [[Hakim Khalid Suleiman XXIII|Sultan Hakim Khalid Suleiman XXIII]], Lord of Flame and Khan of Magma, and now by [[Ayasellah Mihelar Khalidlah II|Grand Sultana Ayasellah Mihelar Khalidlah II]].


## Inhabitants

> Counter-intuitively, the Plane of Fire has the most varied forms of life of any of the elemental planes. It is home not only to countless [[Fire elemental|fire elementals]], but also to the [[Efreet|efreet]], an [[Evil|evil]] race of [[Genie|genies]] who dwell in the fabled [[City of Brass]]. They war with the kingdoms of the [[Fire mephit|fire mephits]] and their [[Slavery|enslaved]] [[Azer|azer]].


### Efreet

***Main article: [[Efreeti]]***
> In [[Golarion|Golarions]] legends and myths, the efreet are depicted as conniving tricksters who con mortals into making disastrous bargains for the promise of wealth and power. These stories are not far from the truth, as these evil inhabitants of the Plane of Fire possess an inherent belief in their own racial superiority. These prejudices exempt the efreet from feeling any remorse or responsibility towards other creatures, and continue to fuel their ongoing wars against the native [[Mephit|mephits]] and the [[Shaitan|shaitan]] of the [[Plane of Earth]].


### Fire mephits

***Main article: [[Fire mephit]]***
> The native fire mephits live in a strict theocracy controlled by [[Dirimalia VI]], who rules over her people from the [[Ninefold Towers of the Matriarch of Holy Sublimation]]. These towers are made from quartz crystal with variegated veins of liquid copper running throughout. The mephits claim that the towers were gifts from the [[Dragon|draconic]] [[Crystal dragon|Crystalline Emperors]] of the Plane of Earth, while the efreet maintain that they were given to them by the shaitan. The fire mephits are served by their azer slaves, whose civilization they conquered eons ago.


### Others

> Numerous creatures beyond the efreet, fire mephits and azer call the Eternal Furnace home. [[Fire elemental|Fire]] and [[Magma elemental|magma elementals]] abound throughout the plane, as do small [[Magmin|magmin]] enclaves. [[Salamander|Salamanders]], [[Magma dragon|magma dragons]] and [[Rast|rasts]] all have presences in the Plane of Fire as well. The enormous, wormlike [[Thoqqua|thoqquas]] can be found along the borders of the Plane of Fire with the Plane of Earth, as can amorphous [[Magma ooze|magma oozes]]. [[Fire whale|Fire whales]] originated on this plane, and pods of their kind can still be found swimming through the plane's fires.
