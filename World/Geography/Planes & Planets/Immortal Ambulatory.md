> The floating [[Demiplane|demiplane]] known as the **Immortal Ambulatory** is the dwelling place of the benevolent [[Dragon|dragon]] [[Deity|god]] [[Apsu]]. It wanders the [[Great Beyond]] at the deity's will, occasionally opening [[Portal|portals]] to the [[Material Plane]]. The Ambulatory appears as a gigantic, translucent sphere filled with drifting [[Star|stars]] and floating islands. The biggest of these islands is the home of Apsu, who lives in an enormous, opalescent cathedral with his draconic consorts. Numerous other consorts exist throughout this realm, at least one for each of the types of [[Metallic dragon|metallic dragons]], in addition to islands set aside for the deity's [[Petitioner|petitioners]].
> Apsu possesses an item called the *[[Mirrored Anvil]]* in the Immortal Ambulatory which is claimed to be capable of smashing an *[[Orb of Dragonkind]]*.
