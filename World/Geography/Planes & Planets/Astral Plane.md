> A silvery-grey void, the **Astral Plane** is the space between the [[Inner Sphere]] and the [[Outer Sphere]]. Through it pass the [[Soul|souls]] of all dead [[Mortal|mortals]] on their way to their final judgement before [[Pharasma]].


## Layout

> With enough distance, the entirety of the Inner Sphere appears [[Metaphysically|metaphysically]] like a [[Sun|sun]], as it is clad on the outside by the [[Plane of Fire]]. Beyond this burning surface stretches a void known as the Astral Plane that continues for an unimaginable distance until one reaches the edge of the Outer Spheres. Like an actual [[Star|star]], the Plane of Fire churns the metaphysical substance of the Astral into clouds and eddies that sometimes coalesce into [[Demiplane|demiplanes]].


### The River of Souls

 A map of the [[River of Souls]].
> The only true constants within the Astral Plane are the countless branches of the [[River of Souls]]: the never-ending stream of souls making their way from the [[Material Plane]] to their final destination in the Outer Sphere. Carried along by a silvery haze, most inhabitants of the Astral Plane give the River a wide berth, or else seem incapable of perceiving it; it is unknown whether this is because of a law of the [[Multiverse]] or by [[Deity|deific]] fiat. The River of Souls is monitored (either because of self-interest or benevolence) by countless servants of the [[Deity|gods]], who help protect the souls from predators, and help to ensure that they finally reach the [[Boneyard]].
