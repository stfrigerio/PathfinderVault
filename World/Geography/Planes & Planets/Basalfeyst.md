> This unusual layer of the [[Abyss]] was originally part of [[Hell]]. [[Lamashtu]] struck a deal with the four demigods known as the [[Goblin hero-gods]], and siphoned their home into the Abyss and placed it next to her own realm of [[Kurnugia]].
> This strange history is evidenced by the various ruins of Basalfeyst, which are in the architectural style of [[Avernus]]. Intact buildings are a bizarre mix of [[Demon|demonic]], [[Devil|devilish]] and [[Goblin|goblin]] styles.
> Each of the four demigods, [[Hadregash]], [[Venkelvore]], [[Zarongel]] and [[Zogmugot]], has their own region. 
> The other main feature is the Screaming Pyrelands, an ever burning forest. It is said that the heart of every tree is the imprisoned soul of a goblin who remained loyal to [[Asmodeus]] rather than switch allegiance to Lamashtu, condemned to burn in agony for all eternity. 
> Other unclaimed territory consists mainly of volcanic wastes and plateaux.
> Goblins believe their heroic deeds will bring them to Basalfeyst on death to serve their masters; they also believe that if they fail they will also come to Basalfeyst as food for the Goblin Hero-Gods.
