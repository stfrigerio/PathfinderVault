> **Verces**, also called 'the Line', is the fifth [[Planet|planet]] from [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Sun|sun]] and is tidally locked, with one side always facing the sun and the other is covered in eternal night. Only the thin terminator line between the two supports natural life. The rest of the planet is the domain of strange monsters.



## Description

> Verces' bright side, known as the Fullbright, is a single scorching desert hotter than any point on Golarion. Its icy Darkside is uninhabitably frigid.


## Rune representation

> In scholarly works, Verces is sometimes represented by a rune: a circle with a vertical bar within it, presumably representing 'the Line'. Additionally there are two stubs attached to the circle: one to the top-left and another directly opposite on the bottom-right.


## Inhabitants

> The only race to inhabit the whole planet are the heavily regimented [[Vercite|Vercites]]. 
> Other creatures residing on the planet are:

> - Armoured abaki
> - Bird-men of Qidel
> - [[Bloodbrother|Bloodbrothers]]
> - Dust mantas
> - Hoarbats

## Gazetteer

> The planet of Verces can be considered as three distinct areas:

> - Darkside: the ice fields on the side of the planet facing forever away from the sun
> - Fullbright: the burning desert on the sun-facing side of the planet
> - The Ring of Nations, where most life exists. Civilized nations are ruled by the Grand Assembly of the Ring of Nations and kept at peace by the [[Stewards]].
> Some of the other notable places on Verces include:

> - the Draws, a network of [[Teleportation|teleportation]] stones used exclusively by the Stewards
> - [[Fastness of the Ordered Mind]]: home of the Ascetics of Nar
> - [[Kashak]]
> - The Outlaw Kingdoms
> - [[Qidel]], Aerie of the Sun
> - Sun Farms

## Connections to other planets

> A series of [[Teleportation|teleportation]] stones links the [[Stewards]]' citadels together, but no known [[Portal|portals]] exist to other worlds. However, the Vercites are well versed in [[Space travel|space travel]] via their [[Aethership|aetherships]] and maintain an orbital settlement in Skydock.


## Satellites

> Verces has no known natural satellites, though it has at least one artificial satellite: the tethered city of Skydock.
