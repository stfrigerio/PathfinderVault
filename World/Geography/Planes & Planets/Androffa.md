*For other meanings of "**Androffan**", please see [[Androffan disambiguation]].*
> **Androffa** is a [[Planet|planet]] in a [[Galaxy|galaxy]] far from [[Golarion]], yet similar in many ways. They are part of the triad of worlds targeted by Rovagug before he was imprisoned The two worlds are also linked in history by the crash of the Androffan [[Spaceship|spaceship]] *[[Divinity]]* on Golarion's surface in the [[Rain of Stars]].


## Description

> Androffa shares many traits with Golarion. Similarly sized and both bearing intelligent lifeâ€”not just [[Humanoid|humanoids]], but [[Human|humans]] predating the race on [[Golarion]] or [[Earth]]â€”Androffa also suffered an ancient cataclysm. Compared to [[Earthfall]], Androffa's apocalypse led not to a dark age and the ascension of [[Mortal|mortals]] to [[God|godhood]], but rather the rise of [[Technology|technology]] and widespread [[Atheism|disbelief in all gods]].
> After the *Divinity* was lost, however, Androffa's godsâ€”the Shoalâ€”returned. These gods' ensuing displeasure led to them reset the [[Planet|planet]] by wiping it of all life.
> This wrathful act itself drew the ire of even greater gods, who imprisoned the Shoal and rekindled civilization on Androffa.


## Androffa and Golarion

> In the years since Androffa's last great apocalypse, it has evolved into a world strikingly similar to Golarion itself, with even some of Golarion's own gods worshiped by its people.
> Meanwhile, on Golarion, the remnants of the *Divinity* have slowly awakened over the centuries after its crash. [[Android|Androids]], [[Robot|robots]], [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligences]], and aliens the *Divinity* transported through the [[Star|stars]] have grown more active in recent years.
