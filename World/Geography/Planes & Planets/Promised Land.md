> The so-called **Promised Land** is a floating island that exists on [[Avernus]], the first layer of [[Hell]]. It is constantly shrouded in mist and cloud as it drifts across the infernal plane. It is also the personal home to the master of Avernus, the [[Archdevil]] [[Barbatos]].


## Description

> Although at a distance the Promised Land appears to be a natural paradise, arrivals quickly realise the twisted nature of the island. Animals and plants alike are horribly deformed, rivers and forests possess a vicious hunger, and the white-gowned inhabitants would scream in horror if they still possessed mouths. The land itself is a roiling mass of worms that constantly spill to the land below.


## Places of Interest

> The most notable landmark is the [[Penitent Cross]], a bleeding willow tree at the heart of the Promised Land. The vitality-sapped victims of Barbatos hang from the branches of this enormous tree, a punishment for those who fail in service to the plane's dark master.
