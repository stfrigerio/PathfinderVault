> The Plane of Air, the **Endless Sky**, is an [[Elemental Plane|elemental plane]] of the [[Inner Sphere]], which in [[Metaphysical|metaphysical]] terms is the closest to the [[Material Plane]]. It is a realm of unending skies, towering clouds and fierce storms.



## Ruler

![[Hshurha_Symbol.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 The [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] of Hshurha.
> The ruler of the Elemental Plane of Air is [[Hshurha]], Duchess of All Winds. The [[Djinni Empire]] also stretches across the majority of the Plane of Air giving them great political reach and clout across the entirety of the plane.


## Geography

> The Elemental Plane of Air is a nearly unimaginably large expanse of open skies, filled with churning air current, drifting clouds, and towering thunderheads. Near the borders of the [[Plane of Water]], tremendous storms of rain and snow lash massive globules of water hanging suspended like floating oceans.  Solid matter is rare in this realm, much of it consisting of ice, magically solidified clouds or conjured rock.
> Despite the Plane of Air being dominated by vast expanses of open sky, several notable settlements exist within it. These include [[Armun Kelisk]], the floating capital of the [[Djinni|djinni]]; the [[Verglas Precessional]], the nearly invisible palace of the [[Elemental lord|elemental lord]] Hshurha; the smuggler haven of Port Eclipse; and the [[Ice mephit|ice mephit]] kingdom of the Sparkling Principality of Hautansia.
> One of the strangest occurrences of solid matter on the Elemental Plane of Air are the metal [[Spheres|spheres]]. Hundreds or thousands of feet in diameter, these obviously ancient bronze or [[Iron|iron]] spheres were left ages ago by their unknown creators. They have been there so long, in fact, that numerous peoples from the Material Plane have colonized them, building entire communities there. Covered in unknown symbols or runes, the spheres are obviously hollow, yet no one has found a way of opening one. They are strenuously avoided by the native djinni, a not-altogether illogical attitude, since a number of the communities living on the spheres have mysteriously disappeared without a trace in recent years.
> The plane is illuminated by the [[Fire orb|Fire Orbs]], distant spheres of intense light and heat that sit at fixed points far from the centre of the plane and are stationary enough that its inhabitants use them to navigate by. Some have speculated that these orbs must contain some sort of link to the [[Plane of Fire]] but no evidence has ever been found of this.


## Inhabitants

> The Plane of Air is the least populated of the four elemental planes, with only a small fraction of the inhabitants of its neighbors. Some believe that this is due to the extreme scarcity of solid land, which takes the form of large chunks of ice or magically created earth or rock. It is, nevertheless, home to a race of [[Genie|genies]] known as the djinni who have built enormous floating cities, [[Air mephit|air]], [[Dust mephit|dust]] and ice mephits, [[Belker|belkers]], [[Mihstu|mihstus]], [[Air elemental|air]] and [[Lightning elemental|lightning elementals]], and an eternally feuding population of [[Silver dragon|silver]] and [[White dragon|white dragons]] that was once thought to be the only draconic presence on the [[Plane|plane]], until the discovery of the native [[Cloud dragon|cloud dragons]] disproved this belief. The nephlei, or cloud nymphs, lead solitary lives in homes built within cloud formations. [[Invisible stalker|Invisible stalkers]] also inhabit the Plane of Air, serving the djinni as scouts and assassins. Settlers from other planes, such as [[Sylph|sylphs]] and [[Thriae|thriae]], can also be found where solid land is present.
