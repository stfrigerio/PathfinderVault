> The [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Mephistopheles]] rules his layer of **Caina** (pronounced CANE-uh), an unending expanse of hanging cages, narrow stone platforms, and [[Iron|iron]] bridges. Caina is also known as **the Bones of Hell**. The realm is regarded as a land of eternal torture and unceasing darkness.


## Geography

> Caina does not have a surface in the way that the other layers of Hell do; instead, the [[Plane|plane]] is composed for the most part of a vast expanse of darkness pierced by needle-like spires and towers of rock and bone, which rise from the depths of the plane to heights greater than a [[Mortal|mortal]] could climb in several lifetimes. The tops and interiors of these structures provide what little flat land exists in this layer of Hell. The depths of Caina eventually open onto [[Nessus]], Hell's deepest layer, but most creatures who fall into Caina's abyss die of thirst or hunger long before reaching the underlying layer. Caina's spires and monoliths are connected to one another by a complex system of bridges, juts of stone and iron chains; these, in turn, support countless hanging cages in which Caina's [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] are imprisoned.
> Caina's sky is permanently clouded by ash and fire; when these part, the darkness visible beyond them is deeper than any night on the [[Material Plane]].


## Inhabitants

> Despite the relative lack of habitable space compared to other layers, Caina is home to significant, although scattered, populations of [[Devil|devils]]. [[Gelugon|Gelugons]] and [[Deimavigga|deimaviggas]] are particularly common in Caina. The [[Infernal duke|infernal dukes]] [[Oriax]], [[Pirias]], and [[Rasvocel]], as well as the [[Queen of the Night]] [[Doloras]], all make their homes in this layer as well.
