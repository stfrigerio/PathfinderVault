> **Kakishon** is a small [[Demiplane|demiplane]] created by the lost Wizard-King [[Nex (person)|Nex]]. It survived the archmage's disappearance in [[576 AR]] but was quickly forgotten. Although creatures managed to travel to the realm from time to time, none could ever discover a way to leave. It is thought to have been finally destroyed in [[4709 AR]] as a result of magical tampering.

> Forgotten by Nex in the never-ending war with [[Geb (person)|Geb]], the demiplane was next used as a prison by the [[Wizard|wizard]] Andrathi to trap [[Jhavhul]] and his army.
