> **Castrovel** (pronounced KAHS-tro-vel), the Green Planet, is the second [[Planet|planet]] from [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Sun|sun]] and the blue planet's closest neighbor.



## Description

> While [[Akiton]] is generally associated with warfare, Castrovel often represents fertility and lust. These generalizations are well-founded, as the planet is almost entirely covered in teeming jungles, endless swamps, and strange clouds of colored gas. The abundance of life across its surface leads to huge trees and enormous creatures, many of them predatory. Its humid atmosphere, while technically biocompatible with Golarion, spawns incomparably powerful storms; living moldstorms that ravage its moistest climates consume any organic matter in their wake.

## Rune representation

> In scholarly works, Castrovel is sometimes represented by a rune: three circles interlaced in a top left to bottom right diagonal fashion, with the middle circle having a vertical bar within it.


## Inhabitants

![[Castrovel.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A [[Shotalashu|shota-mounted]] [[Lashunta|lashunta]] warrior looks out upon Castrovel's magnificent landscape.
> The planet is dominated by a race of [[Psychic|psychic]] matriarchal [[Humanoid|humanoids]] called [[Lashunta|lashunta]]. The females of the species resemble idealized human women with antennae, while the males are squat and ugly and known for their martial prowess. Riding enormous lizard steeds, the lashunta patrol the edges of their city-states, driving off the dangerous fauna of the foetid jungles.
> Another species which is known to live on Castrovel is that of the feline [[Coeurl|coeurl]], although it is not known if they are native or were brought there from somewhere else.
> Other inhabitants amongst the teeming array of life on the planet, include:

> - centipede ticks
> - [[Cerebric fungus|cerebric fungi]]
> - [[Elf|elves]], the second most predominant race after the lashunta
> - [[Formian|formians]]
> - isopods
> - [[Marax|maraxes]]
> - megafauna
> - [[Mobat|mobats]]
> - [[Moonflower|moonflowers]]
> - mountain eels
> - [[Ratfolk|ratfolk]]
> - [[Selkie|selkies]]
> - [[Shotalashu|shotalashu shota for short]]
> - sky fishers

## Portals

> Like most of the planets in the [[Solar system|solar system]], Castrovel is known to have a number of [[Magic|magical]] [[Portal|portals]] linking the Green Planet to its neighbors. The lashunta warrior-scholars learned the workings of these gates long ago, especially the ones that connect Castrovel to Akiton. Because of this, these two planets probably have the closest relationship of any in the solar system. Less common portals also connect Castrovel to Golarion and [[Triaxus]].
> The elves of Castrovel are responsible for a different, more-localized portal called an *[[Elf gate|aiudara]]*, or 'elf gate'. These transport people for thousands of miles, enabling fast, global travel around Castrovel.


## Satellites

> Castrovel has one [[Moon|moon]] which, in comparison to [[Moon Golarion|Golarions moon]], is larger and orbits Castrovel more closely; this difference manifests itself through more pronounced tides than those on Golarion.


## Connection to Golarion

> Castrovel (along with Akiton and Golarion's eccentric orbit) exhibits a strange influence over the floor of [[Lake Nirthran]] in the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Sekamina]], causing it to buckle up near the lake's center. This has an influence on the tides of the Dying Sea that are not fully understood by scholars.
