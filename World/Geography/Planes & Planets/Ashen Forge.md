> The **Ashen Forge** is the name of the [[Abyssal realm]] of the god [[Droskar]]. It is a distorted confusion of mineshafts and forges constantly destroyed by the [[Abyss]] and then rebuilt by Droskar's minions in an endless cycle of misery.
> The [[Akrizoth Horologe]], a massive clock in the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Duergar|duergar]] city of [[Hagegraf]], reputedly measures the output of Droskar's forges.
