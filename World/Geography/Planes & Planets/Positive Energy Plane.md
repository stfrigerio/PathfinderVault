> The **Positive Energy Plane**â€”also called **the Furnace**, the **Cosmic Fire**, **Creation's Forge**, or **The Fires of Creation**â€”is located at the conceptual and philosophical center of the [[Material Plane]] and [[Inner Sphere]]. It is the source of all life and vitality, and is the birthplace of all of the [[Soul|souls]] in the [[Great Beyond]]. It is a place of such overwhelming, fecund energy that all non-natives (including some [[Deity|gods]]) are generally incinerated within seconds of arrival unless appropriate precautions are taken.



## Creation myths

> [[Genie|Genies]] and [[Elemental|elementals]] state and believe that the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]] existed before the birth of the [[Material Plane]]. Eventually, the Elemental Planes mixed with the Positive Energy Plane and the latter's life-giving energies helped create the Material Plane. Many scholars believe that, within this myth, there is some element of truth as to the real historical facts. Others believe that the Positive Energy Plane existed before the gods themselves.


## Inhabitants

> Because of the danger of visiting this inhospitable place, very little concrete information is known about it. 
> It is inhabited by xenophobic, luminous phoenix-like beings known as [[Jyoti|jyoti]], who live in crystal cities and tend to souls as they develop like fruit in orchards of massive trees, and are visited by [[Movanic deva|movanic deva]] and [[Manasaputra|manasaputras]] who watch over wandering benign souls.
> Each jyoti city has a [[Portal|portal]] to a [[Star|star]] in the [[Material Plane]], through which mature souls find their way to [[Mortal|mortal]] vessels. The jyoti also have large collections of powerful [[Artifact|artifacts]], and provide refuge from the gods for half-mortal bastards and heretics.
> In addition to the jyoti, the plane also hosts once-mortal [[Manasaputra|manasaputras]] who watch over and assist nascent souls. The most powerful of these are the glory-clad solar kumaras, who dwell near the plane's blinding center to communicate to the [[Monad|monadic]] undersoul that they believe binds all life in the multiverse into a single entity.


## Generation of souls

***Main article: [[Soul]]***
> Sparks of [[Potentiality|potentiality]] migrate from the [[Maelstrom]] to the Positive Energy Plane via the Antipode. [[Unaligned]] souls grow from these sparks in the Positive Energy Plane, planted like seeds by unknown means from unknown locations and ripening like fruit atop massive, amorphous tree-like structures. Mature souls are collected and released by jyoti into [[Portal|portals]], focal points, and planar vertices through the [[First World]] to the Material Plane, to be received by children of creatures as they begin their lives.
