> The term **extraplanar** can be used to describe two distinct concepts in [[Metaphysics|metaphysics]]:

> - Something foreign to the current [[Plane|plane]]. Indeed, the antonym of this usage is *native*.
For example, an [[Outsider|outsider]] native to a different plane than the [[Material Plane]] is an *extraplanar* outsider with regard to the Material Plane, while an outsider native to the Material Plane is a *native* outsider in that plane. Likewise, when a native of the Material Plane travels to another plane, that creature is considered an *extraplanar* creature with regard to the destination plane.
(One exception involves the [[Transitive plane|transitive planes]], to which very few creatures are native; creatures that inhabit transitive planes are almost always in *transit* from one plane to another.)
This usage is most often applied to describe a visitor from another plane ("extraplanar wanderers"), or a location or action outside of the current plane ("extraplanar city", "extraplanar trade").
> - *For more examples of extraplanar creatures, see [[CategoryExtraplanar environment creatures]].*
> - Something that exists outside of *any* plane, without regard to physical or metaphysical [[Dimension|dimensions]]. This usage is most often applied to [[Magic|magic]] that creates unique states or dimensions beyond the reach of any plane, and is sometimes synonymous with (or incorrectly in place of) the terms *[[Extradimensional|extradimensional]]* or *[[Nondimensional|nondimensional]]*. The term is also used to describe [[Demiplane|demiplanes]] not encapsulated in other planes.
For example, a *[[Bag of holding|bag of holding]]* stores objects in a tiny *extradimensional* space. While this space is naturally also *extraplanar*, the term is less specific and should be avoided in favor of *extradimensional*. Countless extraplanar realms, such as pocket universes, exist outside of other known planes, and many are ruled by [[Gigas|gigas]].
