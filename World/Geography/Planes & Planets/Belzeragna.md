> **Belzeragna** is a private [[Demiplane|demiplane]] created by the [[Infernal duke|infernal duke]] [[Lorthact]] for the purposes of harvesting [[Soul|souls]]. When students of the [[Acadamae]] in [[Korvosa]]â€”unbeknownst to the public run by Lorthact in his disguise as the [[Wizard|wizard]] [[Volshyenek Ornelos]]â€”enter the Hall of Wards as part of their training, in truth they are [[Teleportation|teleported]] to Belzeragna, where they are tortured and their souls collected for Lorthact's gain. When such victims perish, their bodies are returned to the Acadamae as if slain by the Hall of Wards' traps and [[Magic|magical]] protections, protecting Lorthact's secret. Their souls remain trapped in the infernal duke's private [[Plane|plane]] until he has further use for them.
> Minuscule in planar terms, Belzeragna consists of only a single building corresponding to the Hall of Wards on the [[Material Plane]]. Belzeragna is a locked plane, and souls trapped there may not leave except by the consent of Lorthact or his lieutenant, the [[Phistophilus|contract devil]] Chyvvom.
