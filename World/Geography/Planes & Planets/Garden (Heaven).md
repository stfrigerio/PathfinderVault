*For other meanings of "**Garden**", please see [[Garden disambiguation]].*
> The **Garden** is a walled realm situated at [[Heaven|Heavens]] mysterious [[Summit]], surrounded by round walls and an open, broken gate. It mysteriously changes its appearance depending on each visitor: no one sees precisely the same thing when arriving and peering though the gates. Some see a simple garden tended by unknown hands, others a small and sheltered orchard with a solitary fruit-laden tree, or even a [[Gold|golden]] throne, empty and waiting for a worthy occupant.
> Nearly nothing definite is known of the Garden except that it is the birthing grounds of new [[Archon|archons]] from [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]] that had made their way to the Summit. Within its walls, each newborn archon undergoes a strange transformation, though none can entirely recall what has transpired.

> Unlike the other levels of Heaven, the Garden has no [[Steward Heaven|steward]].
