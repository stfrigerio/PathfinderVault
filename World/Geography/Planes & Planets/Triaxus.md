> **Triaxus**, known as the **Wanderer**, is the seventh [[Planet|planet]] in [[Golarion]]'s [[Solar system|solar system]].



## Description

> Triaxus is called the Wanderer because of its irregular and eccentric orbit. It is known for being two different worlds depending on its distance from the [[Sun|sun]]. At its farthest point, far past the great [[Star|gas giants]], Triaxus is covered by glaciers, endless snow fields and savage predators. At its closest point, it rivals steamy [[Castrovel]] for how close Triaxus approaches the center of the solar system, transforming it into a world of vibrant forests, rushing rivers and fertile earth teeming with abundant life. Because of this extreme shift in seasons, Triaxus has two very distinct and very different ecologies. Its current place in the heavens will determine which is the dormant season and which is active.


## Rune representation

> In scholarly works, Triaxus is sometimes represented by a rune: two vertical, parallel strokes with a horizontal bar surmounting them.
