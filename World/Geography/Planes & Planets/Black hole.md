> A **black hole**, or **singularity**, forms when a dying [[Star|star]] collapses with such [[Gravity|gravitational force]] that it breaks through the [[Plane|planes]] and creates a gash in space that sucks everything nearby into a [[Portal|portal]] to the [[Negative Energy Plane]]â€”effectively mirroring the portals to [[Positive Energy Plane|Positive Energy Planes]] found at the center of stars. [[Sceaduinar|Sceaduinars]] guard these Negative Energy portals. Other rare occurrences involving powerful entities or [[World/Items & Equipment/Artifacts/Artifact|artifacts]] can also spawn black holes.
> Black holes' concentrated negative energy causes nearby [[Undead|undead]] to become more powerful, and their destructive forces attract [[Planet|planet-sized]] [[Nightshade|nightshades]].
> The terminus of a black hole in the Negative Energy Plane is called a [[Dawn spiral|dawn spiral]].


## The Banquet

***Main article: Banquet***
> The now-insane scholar Fulvia Nostraema wrote an essay, "Nihilism's Sacred Garrote," describing how the [[Dominion of the Black]] uses black holes as part of a ceremonial sacrifice [[Ritual|ritual]] known as the Banquet, where the Dominion casts scores of creaturesâ€”and some of its own living [[Spaceship|spaceships]]â€”into the black hole's all-consuming gravitational well.
