> **Arkanen** is the most populated and civilised of the [[Planet|planet]] [[Liavara|Liavaras]] five major [[Moon|moons]].


## Geography

> Arkanen steadily blows off its atmosphere into outer space like a [[Comet|comet]], but its periapsis is so close to Liavara that it passes through its primary's atmosphere, replenishing its own by taking air from Liavara and allowing its ecosystem to function for another year. This is the most dangerous time on Arkanen, due to catastrophic storms, predators which come from Liavara, and enormous lightning bolts that arc between Liavara and Arkanen. However, the last of these is also a great source of power, and most of Arkanen's natives undertake their projects around this time. It is speculated that Arkanen might have been artificially created as an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] dynamo, as its orbit and gas absorption from Liavara is not naturally possible.


## Inhabitants

> Amongst the creatures living on the civilized moon are:

> - [[Centaur|centaur-like]] creatures
> - [[Humanoid|humanoids]]
