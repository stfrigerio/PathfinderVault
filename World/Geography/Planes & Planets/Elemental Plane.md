## Creation myths

> [[Genie|Genies]] and [[Elemental|elementals]] state and believe that the Elemental Planes existed before the birth of the Material Plane. Eventually, the Elemental Planes mixed with the [[Positive Energy Plane]], Creation's Forge, and the latter's life-giving energies helped create the Material Plane. Many scholars believe that, within this myth, there is some element of truth as to the real historical facts.
