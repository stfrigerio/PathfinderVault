> **Ghahazi** is the name of the [[Abyssal realm]] of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Xoveron]]. It is a vast metropolis in ruins, Xoveron's desired final state for all cities. The city is located in a range of jagged flint and iron hills. Below the city, there are catacombs that delve deeply enough that they end up in at least twelve other Abyssal realms; these routes are a secret jealously guarded by Xoveron.


## History

> Ghahazi's history is not fully known, but scholars believe Ghahazi has been formed over aeons by Xoveron taking buildings, and even whole districts, from dead or decaying cities throughout the [[Great Beyond]].


## Inhabitants

> [[Ulkreth]] [[Demon|demons]] are distinctive inhabitants of Xoveron's realm where they command groves of [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] [[Arboreal|arboreals]], the latter forever undermine the foundations of the buildings on the plane with their roots. Overhead, fiendish [[Gargoyle|gargoyles]] roam ruined buildings finding aeries in the roofs.
