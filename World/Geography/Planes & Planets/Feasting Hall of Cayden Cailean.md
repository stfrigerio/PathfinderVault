> In [[Mivon]], in the [[River Kingdoms]], there is an unusual hill. It is devoid of vegetation, and has a ring of standing stones on its summit. At irregular intervals, these stones transform into a feasting hall from which comes [[Music|music]] and laughter. It is said that those who enter on these occasions can join in the revelry. Some say that this is the **Feasting Hall of Cayden Cailean** himself, [[Cayden Cailean]] being the god of [[Ale|ale]] and [[Wine|wine]].
> In the morning, the standing stones replace the hall once more, although the hillside reeks of ale and wine. However, more ominously, last time there was also a large quantity of blood among the stones.
