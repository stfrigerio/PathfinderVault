> [[Golarion]] has one large, grey, crater-scarred [[Moon|moon]], which was called **Somal** by the [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]]. **Golarion's moon** is tidally locked, and thus always shows the same face to its [[Planet|planet]], causing much speculation about what actually is on the dark side of the moon. Size-wise, the moon has a surface just seven percent that of Golarion's.

## Moonscar

***Main article: [[Moonscar]]***
> From Golarion, the moon is seen to have a shadowy area on its lower quadrant. [[Astronomy|Astronomers]] document this as a mountain range or a canyon; they are wrong. The [[Moonscar]] was formed over 12,000 years ago during a disaster which led to an invasion of the moon by the [[Abyss]]: the Moonscar is an horrific forest home to [[Demon|demons]], [[Abyss|Abyssal]] [[Plant|plants]], and monsters. The Moonscar is dominated by [[Succubus|succubus]]-mothered [[Half-fiend|half-fiends]] who are a great threat to the peoples of Golarion. The fiends are capable of travelling from the moon to Golarion to snatch victims to return to the Moonscar, there to corrupt and breed and further the half-fiend population. Even more insidious is the return of some of the victims, after corruption, to twist their earthly homes to [[Chaos|chaos]] and [[Evil|evil]].


## The *Starstone*

> An ancient rumour exists that when the *[[Starstone]]* plunged to Golarion thousands of years ago, parts of it broke off in the planet's atmosphere and ended up landing on the moon.
