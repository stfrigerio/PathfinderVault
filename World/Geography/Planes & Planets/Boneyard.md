*For another meaning of "Boneyard", please see [[Boneyard Riddleport]].*
> The **Boneyard**, sometimes referred to as **Purgatory** or the **Spirelands**, is a [[Neutral|neutral]] [[Plane|plane]] where the [[Soul|souls]] of dead [[Mortal|mortals]] from the [[Material Plane]] are judged by the goddess [[Pharasma]]. It rests atop [[Pharasma's Spire|Pharasmas Spire]], jutting out from [[Axis]] into the [[Astral Plane]]. Souls are brought to the Boneyard by the [[River of Souls]], and after judgement, are sent to the appropriate plane or domain in the [[Outer Sphere]]. Some arrive at the Boneyard with their choices already made or pacts signed, but others are judged by a series of courts.



## Description

> The Boneyard appears as a vast necropolis filled with countless courtyards, monuments, graves, and forums teeming with the souls of the dead awaiting judgement. Each of these courts is shaped and styled to correspond to one of the [[Outer Plane|Outer Planes]], and is overseen and guarded by representatives from each of the [[Deity|gods]].

## Inhabitants

> The souls of the neutral dead remain in the Boneyard and are transformed in the lands beyond Pharasma's palace and the necropolis into [[Aeon|aeons]]. These strange creatures act as the goddess' advisors, caretakers, explorers, guardians, guides, and even soldiers in times of war. The souls of the neutral dead also form into [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]] who serve as the bureaucracy of death. In the unclaimed wilderness of Boneyard wolf-like packs of [[Esobok|esoboks]] patrol, protecting the restful dead from both mortal and [[Outsider|outsider]] intruders who would disturb them.
> [[Crypt dragon|Crypt dragons]] are born in the Boneyard, but often prefer to make their permanent lairs on the Material Plane and only return to the Boneyard to escort and represent especially favored souls.
> The God of the End Times, [[Groetus]], hangs eternally over the Boneyard like a twisted moon that edges closer with each orbit. It is whispered that when he reaches the Spire, all of creation will be wiped away in a great apocalypse.
