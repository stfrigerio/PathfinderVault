> The [[Planet|planet]] **Golarion** orbits a yellow [[Sun|sun]] in the far reaches of the [[Material Plane]]. Third of eleven in orbit, this blue planet contains vast oceans and lush green lands, the perfect environment for countless cultures to thrive. Indeed, Golarion is the most populous planet in its [[Solar system|solar system]]. Golarion's crater-scarred moon, [[Moon Golarion|Somal]], fills its night sky, and its nearest planetary neighbors, [[Castrovel]] the Green World and [[Akiton]] the Red Planet (second and fourth from the sun, respectively), are easily visible as colored [[Star|stars]].
> Due to its innately hospitable and life-sustaining environment compared to other worlds, presumably the work of the [[Deity|gods]], [[Astronomy|astronomers]] sometimes refer to Golarion as "the Child". Astronomers on other planets, however, often refer to Golarion as "the Cage" in reference to its cosmic role as the prison of the mad god [[Rovagug]], who lies bound at the world's core.

## Rune representation

> In scholarly astronomical or [[Astrology|astrological]] works, Golarion is sometimes represented by a rune: a circle with three vertical bars overlaying it. One might suggest this symbol is more in keeping with Golarion as 'the Cage', rather than as 'the Child'.


## Geography


### Continents

> Golarion contains eight continents amid immense seas.

> - [[Arcadia]] is a lush continent that lies west from Avistan and Garund across the [[Arcadian Ocean]], which bears its name. 4,000 miles from the shores of Avistan, little is known of this land save in the most ancient of texts and lore from long-fallen empires, though there are infrequent trade and colonization efforts from Avistan to Arcadia.
> - [[Avistan]] is a large peninsular continent that expands westward from Casmaron, bordered by the [[World's Edge Mountains|Worlds Edge Mountains]]. Avistan plays host to a number of civilizations built upon the ruins of great past empires, such as [[Thassilon]] and the colonies of Azlant. The Avistani nations of [[Taldor]], [[Cheliax]], [[Andoran]], and [[Qadira]] are shaping up to become world powers, and the city of [[Absalom]] on an island off its coast is the largest and most cosmopolitan city in the world.
> - [[Azlant]] is a once-great island-continent a thousand miles to the west from the [[Arch of Aroden]]. Azlant saw the rise of the first human civilizations. All that remains of Azlant today is a series of jutting crags and narrow, twisted channels; most of the continent sunk beneath the sea when the [[Starstone]] fell from the sky.
> - [[Casmaron]] is the largest continent, spanning much of the world's northern hemisphere and containing the two largest and most powerful empires in the world: [[Kelesh]] and [[Vudra]].
> - [[Crown of the World|The Crown of the World]] is an immense frozen desert that spans the northern pole of the planet. While much too cold and harsh-weathered for permanent and successful habitation save for a few hardy nomads, the Crown is an invaluable trade route between Avistan and Tian Xia.
> - [[Garund]] is a largely unexplored continent that lies southeast of Avistan, across the [[Inner Sea]]. Whether one is scouring its northern deserts for lost relics of the [[Osirion|Osiriani]] pharaohs or trekking through the near-impenetrable jungles of the [[Mwangi Expanse]], Garund provides endless adventures for those willing to risk its many dangers.
> - [[Sarusan]] is the smallest and least-known continent on Golarion. It lies amid the least traveled portions of the sea.
> - [[Tian Xia]] is a great supercontinent across the ocean east from Casmaron and west from Arcadia. Like Avistan, it is home to many ancient and powerful empires, including [[Minkai]] and the [[Successor States]] of [[Lung Wa]]. Despite its remote location, merchants from Tian Xia travel the entire world.

### Oceans

> Five great oceans cover the remainder of Golarion.

> - The [[Antarkos Ocean]], which covers most of Golarion's southern hemisphere, including the South Pole, and is largely composed of a permanent ice shelf.
> - The [[Arcadian Ocean]], west of Avistan and Garund, east of Arcadia, and surrounding Azlant.
> - The [[Embaral Ocean]] touching Casmaron, Tian Xia, and Sarusan.
> - The [[Obari Ocean]], between Garund and Casmaron.
> - The [[Okaiyo Ocean]] separating Tian Xia from Arcadia.

### Seas

> The nine most important seas on Golarion are:

> - [[Castrovin Sea]]
> - [[Fever Sea]]
> - [[Inner Sea]]
> - [[Ivory Sea]]
> - [[Shining Sea]]
> - [[Sightless Sea]]
> - [[Songil Sea]]
> - [[Steaming Sea]]
> - [[Valashmai Sea]]
