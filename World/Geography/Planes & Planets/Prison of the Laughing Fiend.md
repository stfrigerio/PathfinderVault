> The [[Astral Plane|Astral]] demiplane known as the **Prison of the Laughing Fiend** at first glance seems to be a copy of a realm from the temperate, forested [[Material Plane]].  At closer inspection, the visitor will notice that it seems devoid of all animal and insect life and that there is no passage of time.  The sun hangs perpetually in a daytime sky, and the air has a subtle chill.  At the center of the plane sits an ancient castle which serves as the home and prison of the [[Demon|demon]] [[Tegresin]], also known as the Laughing Fiend.  The plane also is the final destination of the souls of a particular tribe from the Material, who due to terrible magics are unable to reach their deity in the [[Outer Sphere]].
