> **Arima** is the former domain of the deceased [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Typhon]], the former ruler of [[Avernus]]. Once a garden of darkness, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]], and perverse delights, part of Arima was lifted into the air to become the floating domain of the layer's new ruler, [[Barbatos]], becoming the [[Promised Land]]. The remainder was overrun by the deadly [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Plant|plants]] of the neighboring [[Hanging Marches]], becoming known as [[Viperpool]].
