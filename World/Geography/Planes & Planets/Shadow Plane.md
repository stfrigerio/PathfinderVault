> The **Shadow Plane** is [[Coexistent plane|coexistent]] with both the [[Material Plane]] and [[Ethereal Plane]], and seems to be a warped reflection of the former. It is a [[Plane|plane]] where the things born here have their colors, sounds, tastes, and all other forms of perception lessened.



## Geography

> Connected to the Material Plane through the Ethereal Plane, much of the Shadow Plane has similar, but distorted, features that can be found in the corresponding place within the Material Plane. Where on the Material where a city might exist, on the Plane of Shadow in its place may be ruins or some twisted representation of that city's populous. Distances do not correlate between the planes, however, so that a person who takes a short walk on the Shadow Plane might find herself transported leagues away after returning to the Material Plane.


## Inhabitants

*See also: [[CategoryShadow PlaneInhabitants]]*
> Just as the lands of Golarion have a twisted reflection on the Shadow Plane, the people do as well. The [[Fetchling|fetchlings]] are descended of [[Human|humans]] who became trapped on Plane of Shadow long ago. They have become infused with its essence and have yellow eyes and no pigmentation in their skin. Fetchlings often serve as middlemen for planar travelers and are the most populous race in their realm.
> In many people's minds, the Plane of Shadow has very strong ties with undead and for good reason. At the core of the Plane of Shadow resides the [[Negative Energy Plane]] which causes the creation of many of the undead that exist within the Shadow Plane including [[Nightshade|nightshades]]. Undead are not the only creatures found on the Shadow Plane. Other living inhabitants include [[Shadow giant|shadow giants]] and the infamous [[Velstrac|velstracs]].


### Zon-Kuthon

> It is noted that the plane has largely been tainted by [[Zon-Kuthon|Zon-Kuthons]] imprisonment here long ago. Portions of the plane show his influence more strongly than others. While he is no longer imprisoned, Zon-Kuthon still makes his home on the Plane of Shadow in a region known as [[Xovaikain]].
