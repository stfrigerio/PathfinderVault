> The **Dreamlands**, also known as the **Dimension of Dreams**, is a [[Demiplane|dimension]] which overlays the [[Ethereal Plane]], created and maintained directly by the dreams of sleepers on the [[Material Plane]]. It consists of a finite, relatively stable core, surrounded by countless ephemeral [[Dreamscape|dreamscapes]].



## Geography

![[Dream_voyage.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Shardra Geltl]], [[Sajan Gadadvara]], and [[Rivani]] sail on a strange [[Ship|ship]] in a *dream voyage* through the Dreamlands.
> The Dreamlands' semi-permanent core is formed from slumbering desires, and the dreams of especially powerful individuals, like the [[Outer God|Outer Gods]] and [[Great Old One|Great Old Ones]]. It can be entered via the obscure [[Occult ritual|occult ritual]] known as the [[Dreamlands excursion]], and is less accessible than the [[Outer Planes]] but easier to travel to than individual [[Dreamscape|dreamscapes]]. A dreamer that enters the Dreamlands' core for the first time descends a spiral staircase that emerges from the side of a great tree into the Enchanted Forest.


### Dreamscapes

***Main article: [[Dreamscape]]***
> Surrounding the Dreamlands' stable core is a foam of transient dreamscapes, each the dream of an individual sleeping mortal, constantly forming and evaporating when someone goes to sleep or awakens. These can be viewed from the Ethereal Plane, but can only be entered by those who possess the appropriate kind of esoteric [[Magic|magic]]. This sort of magic is unreliable, aiding access instead of guaranteeing it. However, certain dreamers have learned how to lucidly dream, consistently gaining access to the Dreamlands in their sleep or even abandoning their waking life for it. [[Artifact|Artifacts]] like the *Key of Celephais*, *Mnemoka's Flask*, and the *Golden Liao Censer* also assist access.
> When one physically enters a dreamscape, it first appears as a prosaic dreamscape of the visitor's native culture. However, those who travel deeper into the realm discover that it molds itself to dreamers' wishes, slowly becoming whatever they would imagine.


### Leng

***Main article: [[Leng]]***
> The Plateau of [[Leng]] is a distant, ill-understood [[Demiplane|demiplane]] of nightmares that exists beyond the Dreamlands, where nightmares overlap into a strange reality spawned by the dreams of primordial [[Deity|gods]] of the [[Dark Tapestry]].


### Harrowed Realm

***Main article: [[Harrowed Realm]]***
> [[Sonnorae Imlios]] sheared off a section of the Dreamlands to create her own demiplane known as the [[Harrowed Realm]].


## Inhabitants

> The Dreamlands' core is inhabited by both [[Human|humans]] and beings of the [[Elder Mythos]] like [[Being of Ib|Ib shades]] and the [[Great Old One]] [[Bokrug]]. Entire nations exist within the Dreamlands.
> Aside from mortal dreamers and those who've abandoned mortality, the Dreamlands is also haunted by [[Night hag|night hags]], the most powerful of which stride through the land of dreams like demigods. These are countered only by the [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/azata|azata]] sorceress Fiorindria the Longing.
> Figments from the dreams sometimes escape the Dreamlands, usually when a particularly imaginative dreamer awakens. These [[Animate dream|animate dreams]] stalk the Ethereal Plane, feeding off minds and searching for new dreamscapes to torture other sleepers.
