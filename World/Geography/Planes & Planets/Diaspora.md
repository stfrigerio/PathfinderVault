> The **Diaspora** is the wide belt of [[Asteroid|asteroids]] found between the [[Planet|planets]] of [[Verces]] and [[Eox]]. These balls of rock and ice range in size from smaller than a grain of sand to the size of small planetoids.



## Description

> The Diaspora was formed out of the remnants of two worlds, [[Damiar]] and [[Iovo]], sometimes called the Twins or the Sister Worlds. The planets were destroyed in some cataclysmic, historical event that occurred at some point before the founding of [[Thassilon]] in the [[Age of Legend]].
