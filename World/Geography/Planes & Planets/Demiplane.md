 The Reading Room of the [[Akashic Record]], a finite demiplane with numerous special properties.
> **Demiplanes** are generally small, finite [[Plane|planes]], most of which are connected to either the [[Astral Plane|Astral]] or [[Ethereal Plane|Ethereal Planes]]. Most are created when reality is sufficiently warped that small pieces of its substrate fragment and fuse together, thereby creating a stable dimension.

## Types


### Ethereal

> Ethereal demiplanes spawn as a result of the tidal forces of the [[Positive Energy Plane|Positive]] and [[Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Planes]], which also generate the [[Ethereal Plane|ethereal mists]]. This mist sometimes forms localized concentrations or eddies which give birth to ethereal demiplanes.


### Astral

> An astral demiplane is formed as a combined result of turbulence within the [[River of Souls]], proximity to the [[Maelstrom]], and the distant action of [[Plane of Fire|elemental fire]]. These three forces create powerful astral storms shaped like a hurricane that have a calm eye at their center. It is within these stable eyes that astral demiplanes are occasionally born.


### Created

> Demiplanes can be formed by the workings of powerful [[Magic|magic]], be it from an [[Artifact|artifact]], a powerful [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Spellcaster|spellcaster]], or the will of a [[Deity|god]]. All that is required is for reality to be bent and twisted to the breaking point.


## Properties

> Demiplanes are finite and measurable [[Extradimensional|extradimensional]] spaces, differentiating them from [[Plane|planes]], which are effectively standalone infinite universes. While planes are also often traversable via means of [[Planar travel|planar travel]], demiplanes are sometimes subject to more restrictive access.
