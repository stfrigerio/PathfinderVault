> **Nirvana** (pronounced nir-VAH-nuh) is a [[Plane|plane]] of the [[Outer Sphere]] and home to the [[Soul|souls]] of [[Good|good]] [[Mortal|mortals]]. Its true natives are the contemplative [[Agathion|agathions]] and wise [[Angel|angels]] who guide spirits to enlightenment and unity with the plane and with themselves.



## Alignment

> Nirvana is a [[Neutral|neutral]] middle ground between the [[Chaotic good|chaos]] of [[Elysium]] and [[Lawful good|authority]] of [[Heaven]], and its natives intervene in planar matters more frequently than these other goodly realms.
> Mortal souls who arrive to Nirvana seek enlightenment, and the plane is open not only to the virtuous but also those seeking redemption and respite. [[Petitioner|Petitioners]] in Nirvana can shed their mortal memories and worries in their search for enlightenment.


## Geography

> Nirvana is characterized by pastoral hills, breathtaking mountains, and lush woodlands. The plane meets travelers' every expectation of an idyllic, restful paradise, while behind the plane's natural beauty lies mystery and true enlightenment.


### Notable locations

> In addition to its monasteries and the [[Divine realm|divine realms]] of [[Sarenrae]] (Everlight), [[Kurgess]] (the Field of Champions), and [[Shelyn]] (Blossomheart), Nirvana is also home to sanctuaries, refuges, and mysterious sites:

> - The Hall of the Slumbering Kings is a shifting home of long-lost heroes and martyrs waiting to return in a time of great need.
> - The Isle of the Penitent is home to the regretful souls of [[Evil|evil]] mortals seeking redemption. Those who gain it invariably join Nirvana's host of angelic crusaders.
> - The agathion [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] [[Bharnarol|Bharnarols]] workshop is located in the Dragonmane Mountains' foothills.
> - Korada resides in the blossoming violet palace known as the Dream Lotus.

## Inhabitants


### Agathions

![[Draconal.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A draconal agathion.
> Agathions, the most prominent natives of Nirvana, are compassionate beast-aspected beings who guard the plane while also embodying its values. They can be broken down into the following forms:

> - [[Avoral|Avorals]] guard the monastic aeries of the Dragonmane Mountains, including the monasteries of Xia Hua, Borolen, and Etamu. They also represent and fight for the plane's [[Deities|deities]]. [[Korada]] leads the plane's avorals.
> - [[Vulpinal|Vulpinals]] are messengers who serve as storytellers and sages, and are led by [[Lady Taramyth]].
> - Lion-headed [[Leonal|leonals]], responsible for guarding the plane's gates and [[Portal|portals]], are led by [[Kelumarion]].
> - [[Bishop|Bishops]] are unsettling [[Fish|fishlike]] agathions who work as liaisons between [[Celestial|celestial]] leaders on land and sea alike.
> - [[Cervinal|Cervinals]], who resemble [[Elk|elk]]-like [[Taurian|taurians]], represent agathions in matters that span all good-aligned planes.
> - [[Cetaceal|Cetaceals]], guardians of oceans across the planes, craft homes in the depths of the [[Sea of No Shadows]] among its coral reefs.
> - [[Draconal|Draconals]] have extravagant and diverse domains, particularly the Evergreen Palace and Lignitic Labyrinth, and are most responsible for their exceedingly timely insight and their actions in accordance with the [[Deity|gods]]' wishes.
> - Taking the forms of [[Cat|housecats]], [[Silvanshee]] travel mortal planes seeking wondrous curiosities.

### Angels

> In addition to the native agathions, various types of [[Angel|angels]] extend Nirvana's influence to other planes, watch over the [[River of Souls]], and lead assaults on [[Abyss|Abyssal]] [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]]. Unlike the [[Archon|archons]] of [[Heaven]], however, Nirvana's angels focus more on rescuing souls abducted or blocked from reaching their true planar destination, and less on attacking [[Protean|proteans]] in the neighboring [[Maelstrom]].


### Gigas

> Nirvana is also home to a race of ancient, powerful, planar [[Giant|giants]] called [[Nirvana gigas]], also known as "the Eternal Sleepers". These creatures exist in a hazy state of sleepwalking semi-awareness. As they wander across Nirvana they reflexively create fantastical [[Illusion|illusionary]] worlds based on their endless dreams.


### Nirvana dragon

> The [[Nirvana Dragon]], a legend and mystery even among Nirvana's natives, presents his lair only to those who need to find him, and only when they can most benefit from meeting him. Its location shifts in location and among the memories of those who encounter it. [[Phoenix|Phoenixes]] and [[Simurgh|simurghs]] also reside on the plane in their own quests for peace and enlightenment.


## Golarion's beliefs about Nirvana

> [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]] believe that the purest souls in their faiths rise to become Anucaras, or "followers", of their gods in Nirvana.
