*For another meaning of "Blackfire", please see [[Redomeus]].*
> **Blackfire** is a destructive [[Metaphysical|metaphysical]] phenomenon that occurs where the [[Planar substrate|planar substrate]] of reality is damaged or corrupted, weakening the separation of [[Plane|planes]], particularly between the [[Material Plane]] and [[Evil|evil]]-aligned [[Outer Plane|Outer Planes]]. Blackfire manifests as an ebony-hued flame, and its effects are varied but generally unstable to the fabric of existence, including:
> - **Blackfire eruptions:** Explosive vortex emissions of blackfire that destroy the metaphysical bonds of matter to existence.
> - **Breaching:** Injections of [[Magic|magical]] energy where magic should not exist, such as within fields of anti-magic or locations where magic does or should not exist. This can include [[Summoning|summoning]] creatures across planes even when magical forces would otherwise prevent it, or [[Teleport|teleporting]] creatures to evil-aligned Outer Planes.
> - **Tainting:** The weakening of bonds between a being or object and reality.

## Blackfire Adepts

***Main articles: [[Blackfire Adepts]] and [[Blackfire Adept]]***
> Taking their name from this phenomenon, the [[Blackfire Adepts]] are a group of loosely associated planar explorers,  mystics, and [[Demon|demonologists]]. They journey through the many planes of the [[Great Beyond]] in an effort to acquire dark powers from otherworldly entities, with an alleged goal of unraveling the multiverse itself. They are generally opposed by the [[Riftwardens]], an order dedicated to preserving planar boundaries and order, and the Concordance of Elements, who attempt to repair the damages they cause.
