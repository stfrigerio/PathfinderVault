> The **sun**, sometimes called the **Burning Mother**, is a yellow [[Star|star]] at the center of [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Solar system|solar system]].



## Description

![[Solar_system_map.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 ![[Solar_system_map.jpg|right+hmed]] 
[[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Solar system|solar system]].
> Golarion's sun is some hundred times the diameter of Golarion and 300,000 times its mass; its gravity is 28 times that of Golarion. The sun has no atmosphere. It has no solid surface, and generates incredible heat, capable of vaporizing steel even at its coldest point. The sun's intense gravity grows even more powerful near its core, the [[Starheart]].


## Gazetteer

 The sun shown at the centre of the [[Cosmic Caravan]].
> Despite the churning nature of the sun there are some locations of note, though some do move in the convection currents. They include the [[Burning Archipelago]], the [[Silent Sanctum]], the [[Sleeping Sea]], and Starheart.


## Inhabitants

> The sun is intensely inhospitable, yet some creatures do manage to survive and thrive in the inferno. Native inhabitants include [[Dolphin|dolphin-like]] [[Fire elemental|fire elementals]] that leap and frolic in the burning gases closer to the surface, while deeper in the star, plazma oozes that range in size from [[Elephant|elephants]] to mountains slowly move under the immense pressure. Non-native species enter the sun through temporary portals to the [[Plane of Fire]] and include [[Efreeti|efreet]], powerful [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]], and [[Salamander|salamanders]].


## Travel by non-natives to the sun

> Travel to the surface of the sun or within it is possible, but requires complete immunity to heat and flame. Anyone else is instantly vaporized, and can only be brought back to life through powerful [[Magic|magic]] [[Spell|spells]] such as *wish* or *resurrection*. In addition, travelers from Golarion must contend with the enormous gravity of the sun along with its intense pressure; strangely, creatures native to the Plane of Fire are not bothered by these effects. To circumvent these hazards, travelers can create vessels similar to diving bells made of pure force using *wish* magic, or transform themselves into creatures who are not harmed by the environment.


## Figurative uses of the Sun


### Runic representation

In addition, three gods and a [[Demon lord|demon lord]] hold the sun as part of their portfolio: [[Easivra]], [[Nurgal]], [[Sarenrae]], and [[Shizuru]].


#### Holy symbols
