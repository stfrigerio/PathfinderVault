## Gazetteer

> Multiple layers of gaseous atmospheres surround its dark core, each densely filled with a variety of life. However, being a gas giant, there are few places on the actual planet of Liavara that are of interest as the planet constantly changes. The rings and moons of Liavara are of greater geographical interest and also hold life within them (see *[[Inhabitants]]*).
> However, the planet is so dense with [[Ley line|ley lines]] that the Brethedans known as Liavaran dreamers are lulled into a meditative trance by them. This trance is so strong that the colonists never reported back to [[Bretheda]] after arriving, and those who attempt to awaken them face the dreamers' violent fury.


## Satellites

> Liavara has five major moons:

> - [[Arkanen]]
> - [[Hallas]]
> - [[Melos]]
> - [[Nchak]]
> - [[Osoro]]
> In addition, Liavara has many other moons which as a group are called the [[Shepherd Moons]].
