> **Avernus** (pronounced ah-VUR-nuhs) is the top-most layer of [[Hell]], and ruled by the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Barbatos]].



## Geography

> Avernus can be described as a vast plain of terror and desolation. The land is a barren, volcanic desert pitted with volcanic rock and pitted [[Iron|iron]]. Sudden bursts of [[Hellfire|hellfire]] from the ground is a constant fear for travelers.


## Places of Interest

> Fortresses of infernal warlords, the so-called [[Fools' Citadels|Fools Citadels]], rise throughout the [[Plane|plane]], ever ready with legions to defend Avernus and to hunt down renegade [[Soul|souls]] for their own benefit.


## Inhabitants


### Achaekek

> The [[Deity|god]] [[Achaekek]] has a den on Avernus, though the Mantis God's home realm is based in [[Pharasma's Spire|Pharasmas Spire]] of the [[Boneyard]]. The two powerful beings appear to co-exist peacefully enough, although Barbatos nevertheless resents the presence of such a powerful resident without it being under his control.


### Ardad Lili

> One of the four [[Queen of the Night|Queens of the Night]], the fallen [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Angel|angel]] [[Ardad Lili]] holds court at her hold, the [[Stainless Caress]].


### Barbatos

> The [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Barbatos]] rules Avernus as the Lord of the First, literally overseeing the layer from his floating island, the [[Promised Land]].


### Furcas

> The [[Infernal duke|infernal duke]], [[Furcas]], the Knight of Laurels, lives in his fortress [[Forked Pyre]], in Avernus.


### Losarkur

> Another infernal duke, [[Losarkur]], the Beastlord of Avernus, breeds packs of [[Hellhound|hellhounds]] and other beasts.


### Minderhal

> The [[Stone giant|stone giant]] god [[Minderhal]] dwells just outside Hell's first layer in the mountain chain of [[Stonepeak]], within sight of Avernus.


### Devils

> Lesser [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Devil|devils]], most commonly the type known as [[Barbazu|barbazus]] (often referred to as bearded devils), are more prolific on Avernus than any other layer of Hell, constantly on the hunt for rogue souls. These devils pay at least some degree of veneration to Barbatos. Devils known as [[Chortov|chortovs]] are also common, as Avernus the place of their original creation. These hulking brutes possess an affinity with the hellfire, making them useful guardians for the numerous [[Portal|portals]] leading to the plane. [[Levaloch|Levalochs]], also known as warmonger devils, are particularly common across the wastes of Avernus and serve in the armies of the more militant of the [[Infernal duke|infernal dukes]] that reside there.


### Petitioners

> [[Damnation|Damned]] souls (known as [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]]) appear at random locations throughout the plane, all freshly sent from the [[Boneyard]]. These souls occasionally form refugee caravans, seeking in vain for some place to escape their pursuers, but their freedom is temporary at best. More skilled hunters, such as [[Host devil|host devils]], are unleashed to bring in especially evasive petitioners. Only the souls of suicides are left forsaken, doomed to wander the landscape forever. Although the damned cannot be harmed by hazards such as hellfire, they still suffer the pain of being burned or otherwise injured.
