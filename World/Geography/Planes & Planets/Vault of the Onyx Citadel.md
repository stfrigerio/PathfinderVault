> The **Vault of the Onyx Citadel** is a [[Demiplane|demiplane]] in the [[Plane of Earth]] and one of the vaults terraformed by the [[Xiomorn|xiomorns]].



## Geography

> The Vault of the Onyx Citadel stretches 170 miles long by 120 miles wide, with a ceiling ranging from 1 to 2 miles overhead. Large deposits of magnetic materials along one wall provide a reference for navigation. The ceiling glows with phosphorescent fungi and alien crystals, providing a day-night cycle, and the vault's large size and abundant water sources provide occasional cloud cover and rainfall. The vault was seeded with ferns, coniferous trees, immense fungi and crystalline flora. Forests, rivers, mountains and volcanoes in the Vault all host their own varieties of creatures.
> Some of the xiomorns' greatest successes within the Vault of the Onyx Citadel involved experiments in geomancy, which led to the creation of artificial ley lines, called the Stone Roads, tied to various other planes.

## History

> The Vault of the Onyx Citadel was terraformed by the [[Vault Builders]] under an ancient, ferocious, and short-tempered Vault Builder named [[Xulchuwath]], who created small seeps to the Planes of [[Plane of Air|Air]], [[Plane of Fire|Fire]] and [[Plane of Water|Water]] to provide this demiplane with air, heat and water, and imported or created a variety of life. Most of the Vault Builders eventually moved on, leaving the Vault in the care of the [[Vault Keepers]], and over time other inhabitants of the Plane of Earth discovered and migrated to the Vault.


## Inhabitants

> The Vault of the Onyx Citadel's main inhabitants are the Vault Keepers and their [[Pech|pech]] slaves. [[Shaitan]] visitors, who trade with the residents for the crystals and wildlife, are common as well.
