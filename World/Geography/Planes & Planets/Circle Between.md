> The **Circle Between** is a [[Demiplane|demiplane]] floating in the [[Ethereal Plane]] which serves as a planar conduit for [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] from numerous planes and planets. A trackless wilderness, it is tended by an entity known as the Bramble Maiden and by an order of planetouched druids. It also serves as the final sanctuary for countless plant and animal species which have died out everywhere else. Travel to and from the demiplane is accomplished through its massive standing stones which are fiercely guarded by the plane's protectors. One such stone is said to connect to its sister on the [[Isle of Arenway]] in [[Taldor|Taldors]] [[Verduran Forest]].
