> **Atalu** is the cluster of the divine realms of the [[Asura rana|asura ranas]], located between [[Avernus]] and [[Dis]] in [[Hell]] but considered to be part of neither layer. The geography and buildings in each realm reflect the individual asura rana's hatred. The [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Devil|devils]] mostly leave the ranas alone to their blasphemous schemes, and refer to Atalu dismissively as the **Shallow Rifts**, likening it to the [[Abyss]] as a [[Chaos|chaotic]] jumble of unrelated places.
