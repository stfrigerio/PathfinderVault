> The **Material Plane** is the [[Inner Sphere]] [[Plane|reality]] in which the [[Planet|planet]] of [[Golarion]] finds itself, along with its [[Sun|sun]] and its 10 [[Solar system|sister planets]]. It is an unending **universe** occasionally harboring life on terrestrial planets or other less-stable [[Celestial body|celestial bodies]]. Most [[Mortality|mortals]] live out their lives on this plane.



## History

> The Material Plane was created by primordial [[Deity|deities]] as a complex receptacle and testing ground for [[Soul|souls]], as part of a larger process to distribute [[Positive energy|positive energy]] between gods and [[Plane|planes]] of the [[Outer Sphere]]. The [[First World]] is a predecessor of the Material Plane, created as a first attempt at a Material Plane and then directly overwritten by the plane as it exists today.


## Metaphysics

![[River_of_Souls_map.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 The [[River of Souls]], the process by which [[Positive energy|positive energy]] is cycled through [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Soul|souls]] on the Material Plane and back to the [[Outer Sphere]].
***Main article: [[Metaphysics]]***
> The Material Plane is governed by fixed, if [[Magic|magically]] mutable, laws of physics, such as [[Gravity|gravity]] and a fixed speed of light.


### Relationships to other planes

> The Material Plane is [[Metaphysics|metaphysically]] [[Coterminous plane|coterminous]] with the [[First World]] and [[Shadow Plane]], existing in slightly unaligned [[Dimension|dimensions]] of the same cosmological space with the [[Ethereal Plane]] between them as a bordering [[Transitive plane|transitive plane]]. The First World is pulled away from the anchoring Material Plane by its relationship to the [[Positive Energy Plane]], while the Shadow Realm is pulled away by the [[Negative Energy Plane]].


### Creation myths

> [[Genie|Genies]] and [[Elemental|elementals]] state and believe that the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]] existed before the birth of the Material Plane. Eventually, the Elemental Planes mixed with the [[Positive Energy Plane]], Creation's Forge, and the latter's life-giving energies helped create the Material Plane. Many scholars believe there is some element of truth within this myth regarding the real historical facts.


## The material universe

> The Material Plane is practically infinite in scale, with [[Galaxy|galaxies]] separated by vast voids, each galaxy containing countless [[Star|stars]], many stars anchoring [[Solar system|systems of other bodies]], and innumerable other phenomena in between. Its diversity, which blends concepts and creations from all other planes across its countless worlds, results in many metaphysical scholars placing the Material Plane at the center of multiversal models.


### Golarion's solar system

***Main article: [[Solar system]]***
> Even though Golarion has the most diverse lifeforms and cultures of the planets orbiting its sun, it is not alone in the solar system. Other planets include [[Castrovel]], covered in green jungles, and the red planet [[Akiton]] with its vanished seas and endless deserts. Magical [[Portal|gates]] created long ago by lost civilizations are said to connect Golarion to its sister planets.


### Other worlds

***Main article: [[Planet]]***
> Millions upon millions of miles away from Golarion, countless other [[Star|stars]] with worlds of their own exist on the Material Plane. These include:

> - [[Androffa]], the homeworld of the crashed [[Numeria|Numerian]] [[Spaceship|starship]] *[[Divinity]]*
> - [[Carcosa]], ruled by the [[Great Old One]] [[Hastur]]
> - [[Earth]], the homeworld of [[Baba Yaga]]
> - [[Kasath]], the desert homeworld of the [[Kasatha]]

### Dark Tapestry

***Main article: [[Dark Tapestry]]***
> The immense void between the stars harbors strange life. This region is known as the [[Dark Tapestry]], and is home to creatures stranger than any found in the [[Outer Rifts]]. Luckily for the inhabitants of Golarion, the Dark Tapestry is far enough away that its denizens rarely trouble this world.
