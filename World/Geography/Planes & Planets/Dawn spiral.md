> A **dawn spiral** is the [[Negative Energy Plane]] terminus of a [[Black hole|black hole]]. In the Void's darkness, they stand out as bright white starbursts and are surrounded by shattered objects unfortunate enough to have passed through (and the [[Wraith|wraiths]] of any living creatures aboard them).
