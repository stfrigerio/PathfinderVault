> A **planet** is a celestial body orbiting a [[Star|star]]. [[Golarion]] belongs to a [[Solar system|solar system]] of eleven planets that rotate around the same star, called the [[Sun]]. There were once thirteen planets in the solar system, but a historic cataclysm destroyed two planets and left a massive cloud of debris now called the [[Diaspora]]. While the planets are all located in relatively close proximity to one another in the scope of the [[Material Plane]], these planets and their inhabitants are as varied as one could imagine.
