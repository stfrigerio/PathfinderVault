> The verdant **Field of Opsimathy** is the realm of the [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] [[Andoletta]], located on [[Requius]], the fourth level of [[Heaven]]. Here Andoletta makes her home in a villa surrounded by fields, libraries, and shops. The realm is open to any [[Celestial|celestial]] recovering from battle, whom the empyreal lord encourages to learn and study while they recuperate. Here, also, happy families play in Andoletta's garden behind her feathered home and one can catch the smell of freshly-baked bread on the air.
