> The **Eight Courts** of the [[Boneyard]], each corresponding to another [[Plane|plane]] of the [[Outer Sphere]], surround [[Pharasma's Court|Pharasmas Court]]. Each court contains a large [[Portal|portal]] to the corresponding plane and numerous smaller portals leading to [[Deity|deities]] divine realms, as well as shrines to the [[Deity|gods]] and to the dead themselves, in the hope of providing comfort to them. The courts are bustling with [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]] and agents of the gods and other planes, the latter of which claim and welcome [[Soul|souls]] to their destined plane. These visitors sometimes leave behind gifts, candles, paper crafts, or food as offerings.
> The one exception is the barren **Devouring Court**, corresponding to [[Abaddon]], which few willingly visit, and no one leaves offerings behind there. The only permanent structure is a smooth, pitch-black portal emitting the sounds of screaming, gnashing teeth, and bubbling spittle. Only the souls claimed by [[Urgathoa]], [[Zyphus]], or the [[Four Horsemen]] are escorted out of the court; everyone else must go alone, as the [[Daemon|daemon]] [[Harbinger|harbingers]] and their servants are banned from the Boneyard. A [[Demon|demon]] and a [[Devil|devil]] are stationed at the Devouring Court, authorised by [[Pharasma]] to persuade souls sent to Abaddon to choose [[Hell]] or the [[Abyss]] instead. Many panicking souls accept, though many refuse out of spite.
