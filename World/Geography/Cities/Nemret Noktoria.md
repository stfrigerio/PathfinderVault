> **Nemret Noktoria** is the hidden city of the civilized [[Ghoul|ghouls]] of the [[Darklands]]. It is located in distant [[Sekamina]], far beneath the border between the [[Garund|Garundi]] nations of [[Osirion]] and [[Thuvia]].



## History

> In the distant past, the well-defended tombs of [[OsirionHistory|Ancient Osirion]] made it difficult for ghouls to thrive in that country. Instead, the ghouls dug deep into the earth until they found a massive cavern deep beneath western Osirion. There they built a city of their own.


## Geography

> Today, Nemret Noktoria is the heart of ghoul culture, and resembles a massive necropolis designed to resemble the [[Abyssal realm]] of [[Everglut]], home of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Kabriri]], patron of ghouls. The city's caverns are supported by columns of [[Lazurite|lazurite]], with which ghouls have a special affinity.


## Life and society

> The vast majority of the city's inhabitants are ghouls, but a sizeable number of [[Seugathi|seugathi]] can be found in the aptly named Worm District. The city is a theocracy, led by Kabriri's high priest on [[Golarion]], the powerful sorcerer-priest [[Kortash Khain]]. He is assisted and advised by his Ghoul Court, a collection of powerful [[Ghul|great ghuls]]. All the ghouls of the Darklands are expected to give a tithe of their carrion to the city's priests.


### Foreign relations

> Despite its remote location and unnatural character, Nemret Noktoria does maintain trade relations with the surface world, especially with Osirion and Thuvia. Its primary imports are [[Slave|slaves]] (to be eaten and sacrificed to their demonic patron), and it exports unusual [[Magic item|magic items]] and forgotten lore. Ghoul priests can sometimes be found aiding certain Thuvian tribal warlords, and ghoulish emissaries are not uncommon in [[Geb's Rest]]. The [[Blood Lord|Blood Lords]] of Geb give the city an annual gift of slavesâ€”both living and dead.  A small coterie of [[Vampire|vampires]] are known to also serve as the city's diplomats and trade ambassadors, dealing with members of the surface world who are too horrified by the ghouls' appearance.
> The ghouls of the city are at war with the mighty [[Gug|gugs]] of the Darklands. The cause of the conflict is unknown, and for some reason the gugs are reluctant to risk engaging the apparently much weaker ghouls.
> There is also a millennia-old feud between Nemret Noktoria and the [[Undead|undead]] inhabitants of the city of [[Shraen]] in [[Orv|Orvs]] [[Black Desert]]. Any ghouls found trespassing in their vault are immediately killed. The ghouls of Nemret Noktoria also loathe [[Ghast|ghasts]], which are destroyed wherever possible.
