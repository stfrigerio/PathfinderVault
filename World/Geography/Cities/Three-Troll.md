> **Three-Troll** is a small town in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province known as the the [[Verge]] which holds a great number of [[Ice troll|ice trolls]]. Three-Troll began as a camp for ice trolls raiding the neighboring [[Grungir Forest]] and over time grew into a small town. Three [[Rock troll|rock troll]] statues stand in the town square; these were rock trolls petrified when they were caught in the sun during the [[Winter War]] and have since given the name to the town. The ruler of Three-Troll is [[Nedyalka|Baroness Nedyalka]] but she prefers to stay in the [[Arvanoff Elvanna|duke]]'s court and rarely visits the town leaving the ice trolls to govern themselves.
