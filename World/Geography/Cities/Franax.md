> **Franax**, a port town located on the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]], was once the centre of [[Iobaria|Iobarias]] shipbuilding and repair thanks to its advantageous geography. Located on a series of bays protected by three islands, Franax's port eventually spread to cover the islands. However, much of the town now lies in ruins after a fire consumed 80% of the town in [[4651 AR]]. The fire was started in an ill-advised attempt to contain the "plague of boils and bone-aches" that afflicted Franax, but ultimately led to an exodus of its shipbuilding industry to [[Orlov]]. Now those few who remain in the city are caught in a conflict between the zealous [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of the [[Glacircle]] and local fisherman [[Niath Koyra]].
