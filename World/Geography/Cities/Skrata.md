> **Skrata** is a small town on the [[Rimeflow River]], in the westernmost [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province called the [[Verge]] that acts as a waystation of goods shipped to the capital of [[Whitethrone]] from the north, through the [[Iceflow River]], and as a supply depot for the army. Skrata's docks are always busy, and its warehouses are full with goods destined for the army or the Rimeflow route.
> [[Slavena|Baroness Slavena]] is the ruler of the town. She is not interested in running the town, leaving the task to her subordinates and her [[Jadwiga]] husband Ivan Betyrina. Slavena is the current paramour of [[Arvanoff Elvanna|Duke Arvanoff]]. She cuckolds her husband believing herself to be discreet but everybody in town knows her immoral relationship with the duke.
> There are three prominent members of the [[Heralds of Summer's Return|Heralds of Summers Return]] in Skrata: dockworker [[Cherni Oslonovich]], blacksmith [[Left-Arm Karastov]], and apothecary [[Sanzina Rodoc]]. Their main concern is how they could interrupt the transport of goods south to [[Vasterborg]] and the Irrisen's armies.
