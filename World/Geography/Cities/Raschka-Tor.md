> **Raschka-Tor** is the lair of the most fearsome family of [[Red dragon|red dragons]] in the entire [[Hold of Belkzen]]. The family consists of four red dragons, two still only wyrmlings. They were one of the greatest threats to anyone traveling across northern Belkzen until the idea of leaving them tribute at [[Covenant Rock]] caught on. The dragons live in a mountainside cave known as Raschka-Tor which is [[Orc language|orc]] for *fire mountain*. Rumour has it that their lair is in fact just the entrance to a vast city carved within the mountain itself. However, due to the dragons' dislike of nosy adventurers, no one has yet been able to verify these rumours.
