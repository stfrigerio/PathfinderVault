> The town of **Maidenspool** once vied with [[Drenchport]] for dominance of the island of [[Tempest Cay]] in the [[Shackles]]. [[Bradesmar Wache|Free Captain Bradesmar Wache]] of [[Mediogalti]] poured enormous resources into the town, building structures of stone and fine lumber. At the peak of Maidenspool's growth, Bradesmar openly boasted that the [[Master of the Gales|Master of the Galess]] city would soon be just so much driftwood. Quickly after Bradesmar's proclamation, Maidenspool was attacked by swarms of [[Locathah|locathahs]]. Most of the town was destroyed by fire and hundreds of its residents were killed, including Bradesmar's darling wife Ella Wache.
