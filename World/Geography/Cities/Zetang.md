> **Zetang** is capital of the [[Aasimar's Mercy|aasimar]]-ruled [[Tian Xia]] nation of [[Tianjing]]. A port city on [[Point Aykishe]] along the nation's eastern coast, Zetang was victim of Zo [[Pirate|pirate]] attacks when [[Lung Wa]] fell, but has since been rebuilt. Rumors suggest the unhappy dead still persist among the [[Ship|shipwrecks]] in its harbor.
