> The [[Cheliax|Chelish]] port city of **Macini**, on northern shores of the [[Inner Sea]] in the [[Archduchy of Longmarch]], is located about halfway between the settlements of [[Hinji]] and the [[Corentyn]]. It is best known for its prestigious Law Court, to the point that people of Cheliax's southern coast refer to any fair, well-reasoned person as being "sharp as a Macinian magistrate".


## History

> The Law Court, and Macini's reputation for legal precision, date back to a property dispute several centuries in the past. The city's magistrates found a fair settlement for all parties in a dispute over two families' [[Ship|ships]] wrecking in the harbor and depositing their goods on a third family's land.
> The city also boasted a prominent temple to [[Abadar]], the Hall of the Lawgiver, in pre-diabolic [[Cheliax]], and many of its residents continue to venerate Abadar in smaller shrines. The since-diminished Hall is now used as a temple to [[Asmodeus]], and while several of its white-wigged magistrates still worship Abadar, all of them are renowned experts of the *[[Asmodean Disciplines]]* and rational arbitrators who resist the more selfish tendencies of judges elsewhere in Cheliax.


### Veiled masters

> About 300 years ago, [[Adventurer|adventurers]] discovered a [[Veiled master|veiled master]] had assumed several identities and controlled the city's economy since its founding. The investigating adventurers also uncovered suggestions that other veiled masters performed similar roles throughout the [[Inner Sea region]], but these other creatures subsequently disappeared.
