> **Squirestone** is a small village of 50 buildings that has grown outside the [[Castle Everstand]], around its southeast gate. Born from endless baggage trains, supply caravans, and merchants, the village has become home to a number of crafters, artisans, and farmers. It is a collection of 20 simple stone houses with thatched roofs, a number of workshops, and a dozen farmers' longhouses. The only two-story building in the village is a tavern known as [[Strom's Tankard|Stroms Tankard]].
