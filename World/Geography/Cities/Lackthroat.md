> The walled town of **Lackthroat** can be found near the source of the [[Egelsee River]] in northern [[Numeria]], hard against the [[Estrovian Forest]] in the crusader nation of [[Mendev]]. Known as a haven for ne'er-do-wells and mercenaries, the citizens of Lackthroat take pride in indulging their own vices and those of anyone passing through. Despite, or perhaps because of this, Lackthroat has served as the staging ground for many legends among mercenaries and other [[Adventurer|adventurers]] from Numeria and beyond.


## The Haunted Forest

> The citizens of Lackthroat have encountered the strange beings known as [[Herne|herne]] in the Estrovin Forest, and don't know whether they are haunting spirits or mischievous [[Fey|fey]]. One thing they know for certain, however, is that the herne fiercely protect the Estrovin.
