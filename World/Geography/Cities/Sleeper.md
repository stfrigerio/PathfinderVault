> **The Sleeper** is a gigantic monument found in the northeastern-most spur of the [[Mindspin Mountains]] within the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. It resembles an enormous [[Dragon|dragon]] wrapped around an actual mountaintop. Steam or smoke seems to emanate from its massive maw, big enough to fit an entire house.
> The sculpture is actually a series of chambers coiled around the mountain peak that eventually lead into its hollow interior. Beneath the Sleeper, deep in the heart of the mountain, lies the ancient city of [[Xin-Gastash]]. The gigantic monument was actually the great entrance to the ancient city, capital of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] [[Gastash|realm of Gluttony]]. Belkzen natives now call the sculpture the Sleeper. Only the bravest climb the mountain's slopes, much less enter the interior chambers. The local [[Orc|orcs]], being naturally superstitious stay away from the Sleeper and consider it a [[Curse|cursed]] ruin full of bad [[Magic|magic]]. The chambers within the Sleeper are mostly intact although many of them show signs of earthquake damage.
