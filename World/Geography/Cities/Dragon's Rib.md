Dragon's Rib, at center.
> 
**Dragon's Rib** is an uninhabited island within the [[Ironbound Archipelago]] and is the most northerly island of [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of the [[Ironbound Islands|Ironbound Island]].
> It is a forbidding landscape of thick pine forests, rugged hills and tors. The valleys between the hills are often filled with lakes and bogs. The island's [[Black Tarn]], a mountain top lake, is arguably the most infamous location in all the Ironbound Islands. 
> The main inhabitants of the surface world are the [[Fey|fey]], but there is also a large network of caverns beneath the island, which is home to dangerous [[Vermin|vermin]], [[Mite|mites]] and [[Vegepygmy|vegepygmies]]. [[Fjord linnorm|Fjord linnorms]] are known to hunt around the nearby [[Devil's Drain|Devils Drain]] that dominates the channel between Dragon's Rib and the Linnorm Kingdom of [[Southmoor]].
