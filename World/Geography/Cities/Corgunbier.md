> Although most [[Dero|dero]] of the [[Darklands]] live in smaller communities, three larger settlements do exit among the twisted tunnels of [[Nar-Voth]]. The largest of these is **Corgunbier**, a series of maze-like tunnels located directly under the [[Taldor|Taldan]] city of [[Cassomir]]. Countless secret passageways connect the two population centers, providing a simple way for the dero to collect subjects on whom to perform their torturous experiments. Corgunbier is home to almost two thousand dero and over a thousand of their [[Mongrelman|mongrelman]] slaves, and is ruled by a trio of dero savants known as the [[Ecliptic Triad]].
