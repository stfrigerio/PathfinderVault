> **El** is the capital city of [[Sovyrian]], homeland of the [[Elf|elves]] on the [[Planet|planet]] [[Castrovel]].



## Geography

> El is a crescent-shaped city located in a fertile valley of the Woven River in central Sovyrian. It is bound on one side by a waterfall and stretches from there to the thick forests surrounding the open fields of the river valley. A few hundred feet into the city, the Woven River is split by numerous artificial, [[Art|artistically]] designed canals that bring water to all districts; these canals are connected by elaborate, sturdy bridges made from various materials. The canals connect to one current again near the city's ports and the Arch of Refuge, a great *[[Elf gate|aiudara]]* connecting to [[Iadara]], and dozens of lesser *aiudara* connecting to other parts of Sovyrian.


## History

> El is a very ancient city, far older than any evidence of elven settlement on [[Golarion]], and believed to be the very first elven settlement. Due to its age, some scholars theorise that the word *elf* and the elven name suffix *-el* might literally mean *people from El*.


## Inhabitants

> El is home to the most important families and members of the Sovyrian government, who reside in the Great Houses, district-sized buildings which climb the walls of the city's cliff. Most farming is done in the fields atop the cliff, or in the honeyed plains further downstream the Woven River.
