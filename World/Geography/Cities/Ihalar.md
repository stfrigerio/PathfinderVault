> **Ihalar** is an underground city that sits between the [[Obari Ocean]] and the [[Meraz Desert]]. It is the westernmost example of the Khattibi-style underground settlements. The residents emerge only to graze their herds and trade with passing merchants. The city boasts many underground gardens sustained by the city's light wells although the lowest levels of the city have quietly been abandoned.
