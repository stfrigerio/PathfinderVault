> **Hisuikarasu** is the capital of the [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]] nation of [[Kwanlai]], in [[Tian Xia]]. A relatively prosperous city in chaotic Kwanlai, Hisuikarasu is ruled by the [[Half-celestial|half-celestial]] benevolent autocrat [[Sutarai-Gongen|Lady Sutarai-Gongen]]. Lady Sutarai-Gongen's popularity is such that her power is beginning to spread beyond the capital to the rest of Kwanlai.
