> **Aelyosos** is the westernmost city of note in the archipelago of [[Iblydos]] in the [[Obari Ocean]]. It serves as the gateway to Iblydan culture and hospitality to most travelers on the [[Obari Crossing]], and due to its many gardens and the tireless work of its citizens, is an overall peaceful place to rest and conduct trade.



## Economy

> Aelyosos's location in the Obari Crossing allows it to be the major port city of the nation of Iblydos. When parts of the city are submerged, local [[Merfolk|merfolk]] are able to safely travel inland to trade with the locals and tourists. This also allows the city to be known as a hub for gathering food and equipment that [[Adventurer|adventurers]] would need for any underwater excursions.


### Cuisine

> Most of the seafood Aelyosos is known for does not survive travel over land.


## Geography

> Aelyosos is located on an inlet on the northwestern coast of Lalisri, an island in the western reaches of the Iblydan archipelago. It is built around a deep yet narrow harbor that is well-protected, but is threatened by daily flooding that began after the death of [[Aroden]]. This inundation floods the city's low-lying areas, which remain underwater except for two short periods, and has drastically reshaped Aelyosos' waterfront.


### Flooded areas

> Most of Aelyosos' docks are built on floating platforms that rise and fall up to 15 feet during the day. During the flooding, Pantheon Hill at the heart of the city becomes a small island, accessible by boat and a pair of suspension bridges that cross over inundated neighborhoods from the east and west. This central island contains several ornate, marble structures, as well as the eclectic shrines of several of the city's past hero-gods. The mansions of the wealthy in the Pearls district in the city's northwest, also become separated from the mainland during the flooding. Most of their owners refuse to abandon their homes, even though much of their property is underwater for most of the day. At night, bioluminescent plankton is carried in by the tides, causing the coastline to shimmer in a beautiful display of color.


### Dry areas

> The terraced, rocky hills on the city's northern slopes are high enough to avoid the daily flooding, and contain plentiful fruit orchards but few buildings. A rocky promontory called Seer Heights hems in the city to the southwest, atop which stand the multi-columned temples of the [[Cyclopes|cyclopes]]. The bulk of the city rests between these two heights, decorated with bountiful gardens and parks that its citizens keep green year-round. The mica-rich stucco covering most of the city's utilitarian buildings causes them to glisten in the [[Sun|sunlight]]. The city has a wide range of [[Architectural|architectural]] styles due to the preferences of its many past rulers. Lately, the government has imposed a more uniform style that can accommodate the many refugees that have emigrated to Aelyosos in the last century, but it remains a point of pride for many home owners to have at least one room in which a visiting cyclops could comfortably fit.


## Inhabitants

> Aelyosos' citizens are remarkably well-educated and cosmopolitan, thanks to millennia of tutelage under the cyclopes and the constant stream of foreign ideas brought in by the ocean trade. The city also contains a dwindling population of cyclopes who reside in the temples built on the city's southwestern promontory.
