> The inevitable result of over four millennia of warfare and countless unsuccessful sieges on the walls of [[Absalom]], the region around the city is known as the **Cairnlands** and is filled with ruined [[Siege engine|siege engines]] and battlements. Notable among the ruins are the [[Red Redoubt of Karamoss]], the dangerous [[El Raja Key]], the run-down [[Pyramid of the Dog]], located just outside the [[Puddles]], and the infamous, immense, and strangely beautiful mile-high [[Spire of Nex]], located ten miles north of Absalom.
> In addition to these rotting relics of war, the landscape is scattered with stone barrows, shallow graves, and makeshift tombs for those who fell in battle far from their native soil. While the promise of treasure constantly tempts adventurers and explorers to brave the crumbling castles of the Cairnlands, the [[Undead|walking dead]] buried without proper consecration provide enough of a deterrent that plenty of [[Artifact|artifacts]] of ages past remain hidden among the rubble.
