> **Bogsbridge** is a small port in the [[Motaku Isle]] in the [[Shackles]]. It is built in a marshy wetland completely unworthy of any development. 
> [[Falgood Boles]], captain of the [[Brig|brig]] *[[Bitter Wind]]*, founded the small port after he had a vision of [[Besmara]]. He believed Besmara had tasked him to build a port in this marshy wetland. The devout [[Pirate|pirate]] developed the settlement using his personal wealth, despite the boggy location and the fact that no large [[Ship|ship]] could use this harbor. Boles lived there alone with his wife for two years.
> The marsh was gradually silting the harbor when Falgood Boles discovered a unique breed of snail in the surrounding marshes that produced a rare purple dye. The discovery made Falgood Boles a fortune and since then the town has grown. The town still continues to harvest the lucrative snails, transporting it via a sandy road to [[Lilywhite]] where the dye is shipped far and wide. 
> Boles's cheerful granddaughter, [[Tendry Boles]], is the town's mayor. She also tends the inn her grandfather built, the thriving [[Besmara's Favor|Besmaras Favor]].
