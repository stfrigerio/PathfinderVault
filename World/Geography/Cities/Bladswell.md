> **Bladswell** is a small community lying on the southern banks of the [[Vistear River]] where the river forms the northern border of the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Canterwall]] with its neighbour [[Lozeri]]. The settlement lies north-west of the [[Eshirwood]].


## Description

> One might conceive Bladswell as a ferryboat station that has around it merely an inn and a few farms; though the inn is comfortable. The inn and a farm are run by the parents of [[Zoenessa Thell]], a member of the Palatine Council of Canterwall.
