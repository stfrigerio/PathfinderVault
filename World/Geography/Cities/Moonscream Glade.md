> Circa [[4713 AR]], when the [[Worldwound]] was still open, **Moonscream Glade**â€”formerly known as **Moonglade**â€”was a small town of [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]] [[Werewolf|werewolves]].



## Geography

> Moonscream Glade is located in a mile-wide clearing of the northern [[Shudderwood]] at the base of a hill, atop which stands a ruined castle of ancient [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] style.


## History

> Soon after the Worldwound opened, the town's populace had been turned into werewolves by an [[Adventurer|adventuring]] party led by Ahari Blackbriar, an acolyte of [[Jezelda]] who forced the villagers to choose to be turned or eaten. Blackbriar continued to lead the town as of 4713 AR.


## People

> Circa 4713 AR, the town and surrounding areas of the Shudderwood were populated by packs of fiendish werewolves.
