> **Pendaka** is a tiny thorp located on a rocky promontory that overlooks [[Claybottom Lake|Claybottom Lakes]] southern shore near where it flows into the [[Skull River]]. Pendaka has a single inn that also functions as a trading post known as the Walleyed Wife, but the settlement's only real claim to fame is its skilled baker, Olam Keecher, and his delicious [[Cranberry|cranberry]] turtle egg pies.
