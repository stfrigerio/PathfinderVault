> **Saad** is a small town in the [[River Kingdoms]] region controlled by [[Daggermark]], and home to Daggermark's cavalry. 
> The two dozen large timber buildings of the hamlet are protected by a motte-and-bailey wall with several tall timber towers that look over the surrounding plains. Outside of the wall are many well-guarded [[Horse|horse]] farms. All of these war-horses are the interbred stock of [[Yenchabur]] stallions brought to the area in [[4402 AR]]. 
> Saad is also the main trading center for the merchant traffic coming from [[Tymon]], and is often the target of bandits who plague all trade routes across the region.
