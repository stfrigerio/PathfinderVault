> The fertile region of **Rostland** is one of the two nations conglomerated into the modern day state of [[Brevoy]] in northeastern [[Avistan]]. Known for its master swordsmen and proud, defiant citizenry, Rostland stands on the verge of civil war with its northern neighbor [[Issia]], which has gained political control of the region since the disappearance of Brevoy's ruling [[House Rogarvia]] in [[4699 AR]].



## Geography

> Rostland occupies the southern half of the nation of Brevoy, from [[Gronzi Forest]] and [[Lake Reykal]] on its northern borders to the frontier capital of [[Restov]] and the edge of the untamed wilderness of the [[Stolen Lands]] in the [[River Kingdoms]] to the south. The heavily traveled [[Sellen River]] flows through Rostland, carrying the produce from its fertile farmlands and grassy rolling hills throughout the region. For centuries, the rich stores of food from Rostland have sustained the more desolate region of Issia to the north.


## History


### The Sword Baron

> Rostland was first inhabited by [[Taldan]] explorers in the latter half of the [[Age of Enthronement]] under the leadership of [[Sirian Aldori|Baron Sirian First]], a hotheaded, impulsive noble forced to emigrate from Taldor after losing one too many duels. After the fledgling colony suffered a number of brutal attacks from bandit lords to the south, First accepted a challenge from the ruling bandit lord in [[3035 AR]] to duel for the future of the burgeoning settlement. Unable to best the bandit king, First paid his wager and disappeared, most assuming he was gone for good, too embarrassed to show his face after the defeat. In [[3044 AR]], First returned a changed man.
> Answering to the name Sirian Aldori, the "Sword Baron" challenged the bandit lord to a rematch and defeated him handily in seconds. He followed this with a standing offer of 100,000 [[Gold piece|gold pieces]] as a reward for any who could best him in a battle of blades. None could defeat him, whether through legitimate means or trickery and [[Magic|magic]]. At first, Aldori refused to teach any of his techniques, but he eventually capitulated and began to train a select group of swordsmen under certain stipulations. These conditions ensured that each student swore to change their name to Aldori, never teach their techniques to any outside the [[Aldori swordpact]] and were sworn to uphold a secret pact of honor.
> These swordsmen became known as the [[Aldori swordlords]]. They ruled Rostland for generations, each as prickly and impulsive as the order's founder.


### Choral the Conqueror

> In [[4499 AR]], the armies of [[Choral the Conqueror]] swept into Rostland, and despite a strong resistance mustered by the swordlords, the nation fell at the [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]] hand and at the talons of his [[Red dragon|red dragon]] servitors. The most memorable conflict between the Rostlandi and Choral's armies is now known as the [[Valley of Fire]], and somber songs of swordlord [[Estruan Aldori|Estruan Aldoris]] defeat remain a popular aspect of folk culture in [[Brevoy]], the [[River Kingdoms]], and [[Mendev]]. After annihilating the Rostlandi army, Choral's red dragons turned their attention to Rostland itself, and initiated a brutal onslaught of fire and blood that brought the once-proud nation to its knees. In only a handful of days, the people of Rostland surrendered to their new ruler and his heirs in [[House Rogarvia]].
> Many [[Aldori swordlord|Aldori swordlords]] fled Rostland under Choral's rule, establishing a strong presence in the city of [[Mivon]] to the south, amid the [[River Kingdoms]]. Others fled to the Free City of [[Restov]] in the far south of [[Brevoy]]. The Aldori stronghold of [[Skywatch]] maintained the resistance even after the rest of Rostland had fallen, but even this seat of independent Aldori power was reduced to ashes by Choral and his dragons, eventually to be rebuilt by [[House Rogarvia]].


## Inhabitants

> Most Rostlandi are simple farmers, craftsmen, and tradesmen, possessing outgoing and happy personalities. The people of Rostland are welcoming of strangers, but do require that visitors to their land conform to the plentiful and intricate local customs. Obsessed with honor and personal standing, Rostlandi are easy to provoke or offend, and one wrong word can quickly find the offender in front of the local magistrate or in a personal duel. Despite their proud, parochial tendencies, Rostlandi make loyal allies and fast friends if outsiders prove their worth by learning and adhering to the native customs.
