> **Wyvernsting** is the second largest settlement in [[Hold of Belkzen|Belkzen]] by population. It is located in the northeastern-most spur of the [[Kodar Mountains]], surrounded by a high wooden stockade. It controls one of the Belkzen's rare forests and is close to the valuable and dangerous beasts of the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] to the north, bringing wealth and power to its rulers. The [[Murdered Child tribe|Murdered Child]] clan, led by [[Hundux Half-Man]], occupies Wyvernsting from their headquarters in [[Fort Hundux]]. It is said that Hundux is preparing for an assault on [[Urgir]].
> Wyvernsting is located near the mouth of [[Cleftbone Canyon]]. The steep slopes of the surrounding mountains cloak the city in shadow for most of the day allowing the light-sensitive [[Orc|orcs]] to be easily active even during daylight hours. The tunnels and chambers that honeycomb the walls of the Cleftbone Canyon are home to the [[Wyvern|wyvern]]-riders of the [[Wingripper tribe]], close allies of the Murdered Child.

Wyvernsting is located in the northeastern spur of the Kodar Mountains, near the mouth of Cleftbone Canyon. 
The walls of the surrounding mountains are so tall and steep that Wyvernsting is cloaked in shadow for most of the day, allowing the light-sensitive orcs to be active even during the daylight hours without any discomfort. 
Hundreds of chambers and tunnels honeycomb the nearby canyon walls, and are home to the countless wyvern-riders of the Wingripper tribe, close allies of the Murdered Child. 

Wyvernsting features two small hills surrounded by a double palisade wall, next to the deep and forbidding Darkwater Lake. The inner wall encircles Fort Hundux, a well-built, two-story stone keep that serves as headquarters for the chief and his lieutenants, and Hagtooth Hill, where members of the Murdered Child tribe live and train at the considerably less-comfortable Fort Hagtooth. 

The outer wall surrounds the rest of the city on the plains below the hills, encompassing the Market, the cityâ€™s center of trade; Downside, home to the majority of orcs who are not part of the ruling tribe; Backhill, where most of Wyvernstingâ€™s non-orcs live; and Stockside, where the megafauna for sale in the Market are kept. 

Aside from Hundux himself, the shaman and battlelord Gren Two-Axe is the most powerful political figure in Wyvernsting. Gren is a warlike cannibal who always eats parts of his defeated foes, and considers himself Hunduxâ€™s equalâ€”itâ€™s rumored that the two are half-brothers. Other important figures in the city include Chief Delka the Thorn , leader of a small band of taiga giant megafauna hunters allied with Chief Hundux, and Makoa the Gentle, the sadistic master of the Pit, the cityâ€™s vertical underground fighting arena.
