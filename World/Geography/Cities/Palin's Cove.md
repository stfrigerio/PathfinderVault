> Named for the [[Keyra Palin]], naval heroine of early [[Korvosa]], **Palin's Cove** is one of the most important holdings of the city-state's realm. Originally a military outpost, Palin's Cove played a vital role in early [[Cheliax|Chelish]] victories over the [[Shoanti]]. Located approximately 80 miles northwest of Korvosa at the mouth of the [[Falcon River]], Palin's Cover served as a naval garrison until [[4485 AR]], when it became an official settlement of the city.
> Over the years, a number of extensive Shoanti sieges were laid on the town, but it never fell, and was rewarded by Korvosa with a strong industrial presence. Modern-day Palin's Cove can be identified for miles around by the cloud of thick black smoke which rises from its many factories. The pollution caused by the industrial epicenter of the town have caused great animosity and even violence from [[Druids|druids]], [[Gozreh]] worshipers, and even ordinary smiths and craftsmen pushed out of their niche in the market by the overwhelming workhouses.
> Not only do the catapults, ballistae, and trebuchets it produces serve as major exports both for the town and Korvosa, but they remain ever ready for another attack, a remnant of the town's military origins. Despite these defenses, Palin's Cove has long been plagued by the [[Red dragon|red dragon]] [[Glarataxus]], who has periodically tormented the town since his first attack in [[4571 AR|4571]].
