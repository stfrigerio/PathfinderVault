> The **Divine Garden** is one of the easternmost regions of the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]]; it is sacred ground where the [[Vudran pantheon|Vudran gods]] walk amongst their followers. The whole of the Divine Garden is covered in various temples and ashrams, academies devoted to understanding the occult, but they are particularly prominent on the way to the [[Plateaus of Gods]]. Divine Garden, and in particular the port city of [[Sumadhadra]], are often the first port of call for visitors to Vudra who come from the continent of [[Tian Xia]].
> The [[Deity|gods]] are a vital part of everyday life in Divine Garden, for example, across the whole region, [[Animal|animals]] are not allowed to be killed for food to honour the [[Bull|bull]] goddess [[Gaelata]], who roams the region. Divine Garden is also home to one of the most sacred sites in all Vudra, [[Hemachandra|Hemachandra Seat of the Golden Moon]]. This terraced temple hosts thousands of shrines, one to every single Vudran deity. The temple is so vast that it takes nearly a full day to climb to its peak. The [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapada]] of [[Baghava]] is renowned for its incredible ashram and temple complexes.
> Unfortunately, Divine Garden's sacred nature has, in the past, drawn fell attention. In [[4465 AR]], the [[Rajput Shivji Shashibhushan|Vile Prince Rajput Shivji Shashibhushan]], a powerful [[Necromancy|necromancer]], abused the region's [[Holy|holy]] power to build the [[Palace of Ivory and Bone]]. Looting and despoiling the sacred [[Elephant|elephant]] graveyard of the [[Ajitesh Valley]] for its bones and ivory, the Vile Prince reanimated many of the corpses as [[Undead|undead]] known as [[Rajput ambari|rajput ambari]] to serve as enormous labourers to build the palace. The Vile Prince was defeated but his spirit still haunts the Palace of Ivory and Bone, his intentions every bit as vile as when he was alive.
