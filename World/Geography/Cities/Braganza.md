## Government

> Ruled by Prince-Archbanker of Abadar [[Cole Ravnagask]] and his bailiff brother [[Terandar Ravnagask|Terandar]], the walled city has taken a particular passage from their god's canon particularly to heart. This passage comes from *[[The Order of Numbers]]*, an ancient copy of which is kept in the [[Golden Glory of the Lawgiver]], the city's cathedral-bank. It exhorts the faithful to "*frequently shed the skin of the old and clothe itself in the finery of the new.*" The Ravnagask brothers have interpreted this to mean that they should constantly be expanding the city by constructing new buildings. This urban expansion has failed to attract many new settlers, however, and most of the new houses stand empty.


## Heraldry

> The coat of arms of the city Braganza features the crossed sword and hammer of Molthune bisected by the upright gold key of Abadar, the Banker God.
