> **Senara** is a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] town located in the devil-spawn-infested [[Whisperwood]]. It is often used as an example of Cheliax's infernal experiment gone too far. Over half of the town's inhabitants are descended from [[Devil|devils]], and nearly a quarter are actual [[Tiefling|tieflings]].
