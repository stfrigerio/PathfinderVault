> The small town of **Lotheedar** is the capital of [[Meratt|Meratt County]] in the [[Tandak Prefecture]] of [[Taldor]]. The settlement is officially administered by Count Bartelby Lotheed who holds the position of tribune, although he has delegated most responsibilies to his seneschal.
> Lotheedar sits at a crossroads of both the Dalaston Highway and the North Cassomir Highway and upon the banks of [[Lake Stavian]], at the very heart of Meratt County. It serves as the county's largest trading hub and is more prosperous than many of the surrounding communities. This is due to two very different devotees of [[Abadar]], the first [[Gul Gusairne|Sir Gul Gusairne]] is the seneschal of House Lotheed and is often considered the defacto leader as he administers the day-to-day affairs of the town. A strict enforcer of the law (some would say an aspiring petty tyrant), Sir Gul has always ensured a substantial share of the taxes he collects is reinvested in the town. The other is [[Paril|Archbanker Lady Paril]] who is the high priest of the local [[Grand Bank of Abadar Meratt|Grand Bank of Abadar]] and provides a counterbalance to Sir Gul's more despotic tendencies. In fact, some who frequent the town's most popular tavern, [[Count's Cravat|The Counts Cravat]], whisper that Archbanker Lady Paril might make a much better ruler.
