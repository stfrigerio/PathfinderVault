> **Kovlar** (sometimes, but rarely and probably incorrectly, written **Kolvar**) is a small [[Dwarf|dwarven]] city in [[Five Kings Mountains]] built in the tunnels and caverns at the southern outskirts of the fallen great city of [[Saggorak]].


## Government

> The reinstated dwarves of Kovlar established many powerful guilds, administered by the Court of Regents which regularly ship their goods to [[Highhelm Militia]] from where they are traded all over [[Golarion]]. The most powerful guild in Kovlar is the [[Anvilers' Guild|Anvilers Guild]] which employs hundreds of dwarven smiths.


## History

> Kovlar was once the southernmost district of Saggorak, capital of one of the ancient kingdoms and namesakes of the Five Kings Mountains. In [[2519 AR]], after 12 years under siege from [[Orc|orcs]], Saggorak succumbed to famine, but when the orcs breached the walls and invaded its southern district, they were overwhelmed by the city's [[Undead|undead]] citizens and forced to retreat.
> 700 years later, [[Khadon|Khadon the Mighty]] reclaimed and purified Saggorak's southern district, which became the new city of Kovlar. Khadon knew that clearing the entire city from the undead was impossible and would force him to station many troops to guard the nearby [[Darklands]] entrance. Khadon directed his effort to fortify Kovlar's walls and protect it from the undead in Saggorak. Now, the subterranean region connecting Mount Arugak to Mount Mist is sealed, with the exception of a few mines which are accessible from the surface.
