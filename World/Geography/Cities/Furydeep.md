> **Furydeep** is the common name given to the largest [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] city in the Sintos Trench (its true name cannot be pronounced by most non-sahuagin mouths). It is ruled by Kinild-Hai, an old sahuagin who has no visible signs of ageing. Huge sahuagin war parties frequently travel from Furydeep to repel any possible incursions or raid [[Ship|ships]] passing above.
