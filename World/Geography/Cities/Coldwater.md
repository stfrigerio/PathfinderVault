> **Coldwater** is a small town on the western bank of the [[Gullik River]] in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] capital province of [[Thronehold]]. [[Wilimina|Baroness Wilimina]] is the ruler of the town.
> The peasants of Coldwater look with envy the changing seasons in the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] but no peasant is allowed to cross the river. They have to work the docks and house and entertain the merchants traveling up and down the Gullik River. Some young and rebellious [[Jadwiga]] have formed a stilyagi gang and call themselves the Lords of the Tusk. They are led by Paval Turosky, a foolish youth, and enjoy crossing the river and imitate the [[Kellid]] barbarians. On some occasions the Lords wander deep into the foreign lands and they say they want to forage deeper into the wilds to hunt [[Bison|bison]] and the [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|prehistoric animals]] that roam those lands.
