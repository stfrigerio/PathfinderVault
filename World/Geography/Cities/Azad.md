> The city of **Azad** sits on the northern shores of the [[Betul Sea]] in the [[Western Ghats]] region of [[Vudra]]. Despite being a city of the Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra, in terms of aesthetics, Azad is much closer in appearance to a [[Kelesh]] city as its architecture is dominated by beautiful domes and soaring minarets.
