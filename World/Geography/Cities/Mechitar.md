> **Mechitar** (pronounced meh-KEE-tar) is the capital of the [[Undead|undead]]-ruled realm of [[Geb's Rest]], and its second-largest city. Its architecture consists of [[Osirion]]-style pyramids, jet black in colour, each home to one of the [[Blood Lord|Blood Lords]] or other influential local families. The largest, the [[Cinerarium]], serves as the palace of the nation's ruler, [[Geb (person)|Geb]]. Mechitar's busy harbour is the main outlet for the country's food exports. The city's largest temple is devoted to [[Urgathoa]], and has both living and undead staff.
