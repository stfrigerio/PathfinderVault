> **Zo Piaobo** is a strange floating principality that drifts between the islands within the regions of [[Atas Pulu]] and [[Tengah Pulu]] of [[Minata]]. The city was founded in [[4609 AR]] shortly after the fall of [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]] by a group of disgruntled former captains from Lung Wa's navy. Zo Piaobo consists of hundreds of bundles of driftwood, [[Raft|rafts]], and [[Ship|ships]] all lashed together to create one huge, artificial island on which the city sits. The residents of Zo Piaobo often detach parts of the city to form smaller flotillas called "kipakus" that function like miniature versions of Zo Piaobo. These kipakus can be found floating in the river mouths and harbours of many of the nations across [[Tian Xia]]. While not the largest city in Minata, Zo Piaobo represents the largest allied group of [[Pirate|pirates]] in the Wandering Isles, which gives the city a lot of political clout.
