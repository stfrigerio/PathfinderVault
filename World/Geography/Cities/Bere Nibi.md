> **Bere Nibi** is a special [[Kallijae]] settlement far away from most of their population in and around [[Lake Ocota]]. Bere Nibi serves as the permanent training grounds for young Kallijae, and is far away in the [[Bandu Hills]] because the Kallijae council decided that getting there would be part of the challenge in the process to becoming a warrior.
