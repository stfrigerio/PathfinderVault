> **Vialesk** (pronounced VEE-ah-lehsk), the **City of Splendid Waves**, is the independent trade city of the [[Maridar|maridar]], and can be found floating in the [[Plane of Water|Elemental Plane of Water]]. It is unaffiliated with the greater powers of that realm, and has positioned itself as a place for open trade and neutral negotiations. The city is built on an enormous block of granite and topped by an air bubble, allowing both water-breathing and air-breathing species to easily cohabitate. Some of its oldest stone and shell towers resemble [[Azlant|Azlanti]] architecture, leading scholars to speculate that the maridar are related to the ancient [[Azlanti human ethnicity|humans]] of that realm.
