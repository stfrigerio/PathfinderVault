> Situated on the northern bank of the [[Korir River]] delta, **Port Freedom** is [[Sargava|Sargavas]] second port, behind the capital [[Anthusis|Eleder]].
> The sandbanks of the delta mean the port cannot accommodate large, deep water [[Ship|ships]], and are also a serious hazard to the river trade with [[Kalabuto]]. Barges travelling the river normally call upon the services of the [[Rivermen's Guild|Rivermens Guild]].
> In theory, the town is ruled by Sargava's leader, the Grand Custodian, [[Utilinus|Baron Utilinus]]. However, the Baron lives in Eleder, and has many calls upon his time, and the day to day running of the town is carried out by a council made up of representatives of the various companies which do business along the river. In effect, the town is controlled by the Rivermen's Guild.
