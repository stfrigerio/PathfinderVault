## Storytelling

> It has, for thousands of years, maintained a tradition of insistently interviewing passing strangers to tell the elders their life stories. These elders retell the stories orally, and preserve important or special tales once every decade by writing them on papyrus scrolls. This collection makes Kalit the home of an extensive, if idiosyncratic, history of Osirion and the [[Inner Sea region]] as told through an autobiographical lens.
> In recent years, [[Adventurer|adventurers]] have eagerly traveled to Kalit to peruse the old stories for relic-seeking leads in exchange for freely relating their own.
