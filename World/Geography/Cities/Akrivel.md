> **Akrivel** is the home city of the Leopard Clan, a clan of several hundred [[Ekujae]] [[Elf|elves]]. It is located high in the trees in the [[Mwangi Jungle]].


## Geography

> Akrivel is built high up in the canopy of the Mwangi Jungle, about 10 miles from a temple of [[Ketephys]] that serves as the exit side of [[Alseta's RingPortals|Huntergate]]. It is also near to [[Whitebridge Station]], and the elves of Akrivel participated in its destruction.


## People

> Akrivel is home almost entirely to Ekujae elves, with a few [[Ekujae half-elf|half-elves]] as well. It is governed by Ose Panin and Ose Atsu, two female identical twin Ekujae elves. The settlement's chief linguist is a half-elf named Nketiah, whose father Jahsi is a respected warrior and *keledi* of the clan. Akrivel is also home to numerous elves who were previously [[Slave|slaves]] of the [[Aspis Consortium]] at Whitebridge Station, most notably Akosa, who contributed greatly to their slaughter.
