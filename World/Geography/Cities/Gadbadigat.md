> **Gadbadigat** is an outlaw city that exists at the very heart of the [[Narhari Desert]], one of the most rugged and harsh regions of the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]]. At the very end of the [[Bahig River]], the biggest source of water in the arid desert, the Bahig disappears into a huge, miles-wide sinkhole at the heart of the desert; Gadbadigat is built around this vast abyss.
