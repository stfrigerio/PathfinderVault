> First founded in [[1528 AR]], **Mirnbay** is a vibrant and prosperous port city. Protected by palisades and located on a peaceful lagoon of the [[Castrovin Sea]] near the mouth of the [[Myrfrus River]], Mirnbay is the largest and most peaceful city in the land of [[Iobaria]]. 
> Along with several other nearby [[Humanoid|humanoid]] settlements, Mirnbay was sacked in [[1900 AR]] by the united [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaur]] tribes of the [[Caemorin]], under the banner of [[Errindayn the Seer]]. Mirnbay was later refounded in [[2108 AR]] with its defences significantly strengthened, and centaurs were banned from the city for the next 400 years. With [[New Iobaria|New Iobarias]] collapse in [[4659 AR]], Mirnbay became one of last remaining power centres in the region. 
> Mirnbay's 22 noble houses rule the port city through a labyrinthine political system based on careful alliances and strategies. This system has faced disruption from the recent influx of [[Galt|Galtan]] nobility fleeing that nation's revolution. Currently, Galtans control more than a third of the city's trade guilds, as well as five of the 22 noble houses. The city is led by an alliance of [[House Rhukov]], a breakaway faction of the Iobarian royal [[House Arjal]] that controls the [[Wizard|wizards]] of the city's arcane college, and [[House Xsagi]], which controls Mirnbay's military.
