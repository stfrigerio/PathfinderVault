> **Badelund** is a well-fortified town on the [[Frozen Road]], in the north of the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] capital province of [[Thronehold]].
> Badelund is surrounded by high walls to protect the small peasant town from uninvited [[Fey|fey]] visitors. [[Feyfrost]] fey are notorious child-stealers. Badelund is the first village on the Frozen Road west of [[Isseld]] and hosts a number of inns and taverns to serve the tired merchants sailing the Frozen Road. [[Pavlina|Baroness Pavlina]] is the ruler of the town. Because of her kindness and her love for a peasant, Pavlina was sent to Badelund as a punishment. The Baroness and her [[Ulfen]] husband [[Oddvar Pavelsson]] are wise governors and do their best to make peasants' life bearable. It is well known that Pavlina sends mercenary groups north to retrieve stolen children. Such groups are the Home Again Safe led by [[Helena Oukarnion]] and the White Dawn Hunters led by [[Mikhail Shalanov]].
