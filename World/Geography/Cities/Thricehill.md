> Located on the [[Pale River]] approximately 12 miles from [[Hook Ford]] and town of [[Bronze Hook]], the farming and trading village of **Thricehill** is one of the few pockets of civilization in the treacherous northwestern reaches of [[Katapesh]]. 
> Founded in [[4697 AR]], the village has become known for the olives that grow in groves along the three hills surrounding the community (which also give the hamlet its name). Primarily growing its own produce and shipping the surplus down the river to trade in the heart of Katapesh, the village has had noticeable success in its short history, and the residents are worried that they are a nice, under-guarded target for raiders. While a small, poorly maintained palisade provides some protection to Thricehill's seventy-odd inhabitants, the townsfolk seek competent defenders to augment their small, untested force of guardsmen.
