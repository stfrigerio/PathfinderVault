> **Bluestone** is a hamlet on the border of [[Molthune]] and [[Nirmathas]] that frequently changes hands between the two nations. It was originally built around a circle of stones and a shrine to [[Gozreh]]. Its frequent changes in ownership has weakened the town's economy considerably, and the village no longer contains many elaborate structures outside the original Gozren shrine.
