> One of the newest settlements in [[Varisia]], the village of **Abken** was founded in [[4668 AR]] as a commune by peace-loving, lower-class [[Korvosa|Korvosans]]. It is located on the banks of the upper [[Yondabakari River]] (before it flows into [[Lake Syrantula]]), about 45 miles northeast of [[Melfesh]]. The town is surrounded by a wooden palisade, and is fiercely protected by its inhabitants.



## Government

> The inner workings of the town are kept secret from outsiders, but it is known that Abken's citizens see each other as one large family. Entrance into their fold is only permitted by a vote or through marriage. Troublesome or overly inquisitive outsiders are quickly dealt with, as everyone in the small town (even the children) is trained in armed combat.


## Relations with outsiders


### Korvosa

> Even though the Korvosan government considers the town one of its holdings, it is also a persistent annoyance, as it only occasionally pays taxes. When the Korvosans get annoyed enough to remind the village's elders, Abken settles its debts in the form of foodstuffs and even some illicit drugs such as [[Recreational drugs of GolarionCabble-Weed|cabble-weed]] and [[Recreational drugs of GolarionFlayleaf|flayleaf]].


### Kaer Maga

> Abken (along with the other local farming towns in the area) is one of the main suppliers of foodstuffs and other consumables for the nearby city of [[Kaer Maga]]. Farmers and ranchers find it easier and more economical to haul their wares to the bottom of the [[Halflight Path]] rather than ship it all the way downriver to Lake Syrantula and beyond.


### Trouble with Shoanti

> The [[Sklar-Quah]] tribe of the [[Shoanti]] occasionally travels off the [[Storval Rise]] to launch attacks against the smaller farming communities of the Yondabakari River valley, including Abken.
