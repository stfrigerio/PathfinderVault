> **Jula** is a coastal village in the southern [[Sodden Lands]], populated by hardy folk who defy the [[Eye of Abendego]] and refuse to leave the Sodden Lands for more temperate climes.



## Geography

> Jula was originally built among steep river valleys, on the region's safest highland road. After the Eye of Abendego formed, the lower districts drowned; only the buildings on the mountain top that are above the flood line and the smugglers' tunnels remain habitable, and are still battered by the wind. A network of ropes and pulleys connect important buildings.


## Government

> Jula is controlled by the [[Knights of Abendego]], a bandit gang and cult of [[Norgorber]]. They control the population by pillaging the town's resources and profiting off what little trade still remains. The forge is forced to work around the clock to keep the Knights armed.
> Jula's inhabitants are faced with the difficult choice of leaving (and becoming refugees) or being [[Enslaved|enslaved]] by the Knights of Abendego. However, Jula's leaders, led by [[Heveril Dagambi]], an ex-[[Paladin|paladin]] of [[Erastil]], see the Knights of Abendego as just the latest threat that they will eventually overcome.


## History

> Before the death of [[Aroden]], Jula served as a stopping point between [[Yamasa]] and the [[Shackles]], where travellers could drink fresh water from the Green and Blue Flows. A protective ibex with bronze horns, associated with [[Erastil]], lived nearby until it died defending an Erastilian priest, who proceeded to build the Hall of the Watchful Ibex. Jula's prosperity ended in [[4606 AR]], when the Eye of Abendego opened, drowning the districts located in the town's valleys.
> After a few months, a massive [[Elasmosaurus|elasmosaurus]] arrived at the bay and trampled the newly-built docks and [[Boat|boats]]. The survivors harpooned and slaughtered the elasmosaurus, and turned its skeleton into the Obeondo Coil, a symbol of the town's defiance and resilience.
> In [[4661 AR]], four [[Ship|ships]] from [[Cheliax]] invaded Jula. For two days, the Julans fought [[House Thrune|Thrune]] warriors and [[Hell hound|hell hounds]] from the Hall of the Watchful Ibex. On the third day, the invaders [[Summon|summoned]] a [[Barbazu|barbazu]], but Dasen's Dazzling Dozen, an itinerant [[Halfling|halfling]] club, came upon Jula and joined the townsfolk, and together they drove the invaders back to sea. The loot from the ships kickstarted Jula's economic growth, and the halflings decided to settle in the town.
> In [[4699 AR]], the Knights of Abendego arrived at Jula. Under cover of a storm, they rounded up the local council and demanded they listen to their demands.


## Environs

> Jula is the closest extant settlement to the Temple of Xanthuun to the northeast, though even the refugees of Jula avoid the [[Curse|cursed]] temple.
> A number of dangers can be found along the swampy coastline between Jula and [[Kokutang]], including a [[Koboto]] tribe called the Storm Merchants and an infamous [[Muck bunyip|muck bunyip]] called Old Wulunga.
