> **Goatshead** is the main settlement on the [[Firegrass Isle]] in the [[Shackles]]. It was founded In [[4642 AR]] by a trio of [[Pirate|pirate]] captains who settled on the island. The [[Pirate Council]] laid the blame for all and any pirate misbehavior against [[Sargava|Sargavan]] vessels on the Firegrass island buccaneers. Made the scapegoats of every Sargavan complaint, these three captains named their settlement Goatshead and adopted a flag with a white [[Goat|goats]] head on a black field.
