> **Soduras** is a small fishing community on the [[Iceflow River]], which forms the border between the [[Irrisen]] province of [[Bleakmarch]] and the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Hagreach]]. Due to its location, it is frequently used as a stopover and resupply point for raiding parties of [[Ice troll|ice trolls]], [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]], or mercenary bands conducting cross-border raids.
> The ruler of the town, [[Vjera|Baroness Vjera]] encourages the martial visitors, ordering the townsfolk to provide housing, food and entertainment. Soduras' north end houses a large number of inns as well as fighting pits that cater to ice trolls and winter wolves. Human mercenary companies usually stay in the south end of the town enjoying themselves at the brothels of [[Plana Vectenstyn|Madame Plana Vectenstyn]]. Life is hard for Soduras' residents but has given birth to tough adventurers.
