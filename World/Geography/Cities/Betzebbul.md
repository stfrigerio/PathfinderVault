> **Betzebbul** is the floating citadel of [[Baalzebul]].  Also called the **Lofty House**, the capital and center of [[Cocytus]] floats above a plain of black snow and lamenting [[Soul|souls]], shackled to the ice below with great frozen chains which must be scaled by those who seek to petition the Lord of Flies.  Atop the glacier is an incongruous autumnal city filled with gorgeous architecture and religious edifices dedicated to Baalzebul's accomplishments, even as corners of his court hide [[Unholy|unholy]] charnel pits and other desecrations.  The central spire houses the White Son's throne room where hangs the shackled form of the near-dead and forgotten [[Deity|god]] [[Azhia]], on whom Baalzebul's swarm constantly feeds.
