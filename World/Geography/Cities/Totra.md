> **Totra**, founded in [[-2587 AR]] by the Conquering Pharaoh [[An-Hepsu II]], is the largest of [[Osirion]]'s ports outside [[Sothis]]. The city is often seen not only as a symbol of the country's power, but a symbol of its excesses as well. When the An Dynasty subjugated what would become [[Thuvia]] and [[Rahadoum]] with its fleets (known as the Great Atoqua), Totra saw an influx of slaves who would build the country's pyramids and monuments. The city's under-classes and nobility are still almost exclusively [[Garundi (human ethnicity)|Garundi]], and harbor suspicion and prejudice against [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshites]] for their millennia of foreign rule. Following the death of the [[Menedes XXVI|Fallen Pharaoh]] and the [[Qadira|Qadiran]] invasion of [[1532 AR]], many of Totra's ancient monuments were toppled by the invaders. In a turnaround, the city's harbor now hosts a red granite statue of [[An-Hepsu II]], built on a new island created from the toppled statues of Qadiran satraps.
> The city is loyal to [[Khemet III]], but the nobility bemoan the heavy taxation they suffer.
