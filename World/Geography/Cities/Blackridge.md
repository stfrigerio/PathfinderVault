> **Blackridge** is the young capital of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] region of [[Devil's Perch|Devils Perch]], within the [[Archduchy of Hellcoast]].



## Geography

> Blackridge is nestled in the [[Menador Mountains]] of western Cheliax, southeast of [[Pezzack]] and south of [[Citadel Enferac]].


## Government

> The town and province are both led by [[Parsellon Alterras]], the provisional governor of Devil's Perch. Blackridge's militia is small and ineffectual, and its governor relies on [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]] of [[Citadel Enferac]] for defense and assistance.


## History

> Blackridge was founded around [[4700 AR]] to help Cheliax exploit potential mineral deposits in the Menador Mountains. The discovery of a [[Sorvus's Strike|silver lode]] near [[Crackspike]] around [[4711 AR]] led to an extended and bloody conflict with native [[Strix|strix]] of [[Windspire]].
> The conflict was resolved by a treaty that grants Cheliax the privilege to mine [[Silver|silver]] for 100 years and 1 day, or until at least 4811 AR, as long as miners avoid encroaching on strix hunting grounds or [[Tokarai Springs]]. Provisional Governor Alterras was one of four parties to sign the treaty, along with Paralictor Adarai of the [[Order of the Gate]], Velenne of the Chelish military, and [[Kirii]] of the [[Windspire tribe]] of strix.
