> For more than 4,000 years, **Absalom** (pronounced AB-sah-lahm) has been the City at the Center of the World, a metropolis-sized showcase of the greatest treasures in all [[Golarion]]. The importance and influence of Absalom upon the [[Inner Sea]] and the whole of Golarion can not be overstated. The city not only holds a key strategic position for both commercial and military endeavors in the region, but encompasses the site of the [[Ascension|ascension]] of four [[Deity|deities]] and claims to have been founded by none other than the Last Azlanti, the god [[Aroden]]. It is not without reason that the passage of time throughout the [[Inner Sea region]] is counted in [[Absalom Reckoning]].



## Geography
> 
Situated on the southern coast of the [[Isle of Kortos]], Absalom is the largest city in the [[Inner Sea region]] and quite possibly the entire world. The ice-capped peaks of the [[Kortos Mounts]] are among the highest known in the world, stretching high above treeline. Countless abandoned siege engines and constructions of war from the numerous failed attempts throughout history to take the city by force lie scattered throughout the surrounding countryside in what has become known as the [[Cairnlands]] and the wreckage of armadas of unsuccessful attempts on the city from the sea all but block the wide harbor in a mass known as the [[Flotsam Graveyard]].![[Absalom_map.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 A map of Absalom
> The city itself is enormous: it stretches more than seven miles from the [[Starwatch Keep]] to [[Azlanti Keep]] and more than five miles from [[Westgate]] to [[Eastgate]], and Absalom has three times as many residents as the capital of [[Cheliax]], [[Egorian]].


### Districts

***Main article: [[City districts of Absalom]]***
> A city the size of Absalom could not function as a single cohesive unit, thus it has been divided or split naturally over time into a handful of distinct districts, each a city unto itself both in terms of sheer population and overall atmosphere, and each having its own district council to run its day-to-day affairs. From the high-class havens of the [[Petal District|Petal]] and [[Ivy District|Ivy Districts]] to the dangerous and destitute districts of the [[Puddles]] and [[Precipice Quarter]], Absalom's neighborhoods run the gamut of both the economic and social spectra. Additionally, austere monuments of historical and spiritual significance draw thousands of people to [[Azlanti Keep]], the [[Ascendant Court]] and [[Wise Quarter]] on a daily basis.


### Greater Kortos

> More than just a city, Absalom controls all the land on and around the Isle of Kortos (though much of the isle remains wilderness). Many places show the sign of Absalom's great age, from the ancient forest of the [[Immenwood]], to the aging [[Aeon Tower|Aeon Towers]] of the [[Swardlands]].


#### Cairnlands

***Main article: [[Cairnlands]]***
> The Cairnlands are a wasted plateau surrounding the city of Absalom that are littered with the siege castles from thousands of years of failed invasions. These attract treasure hunters from around the world and are home to many creatures, brigands, and [[Undead|undead]]. The greatest of the siege castles is the Spire Nex, a mile-high spire located 10 miles north of the city.


#### Diobel

***Main article: [[Diobel]]***
> Diobel, the smaller of the two settlements, is a bustling port town located on the western coast of Kortos. The town is a center of trade in its own right, acting as a hub for fishermen, traders and smugglers wishing to bring illicit goods into the City at the Center of the World via overland caravan instead of through the closely watched harbor of Absalom proper. Because of its important position as an alternative shipping route into the city, control of Diobel is very valuable and rising factions wishing to gain power in Absalom can often be seen first across the Isle in Diobel. The city is currently ruled by [[Avid Arnsen|Scion Lord Avid of House Arnsen]], a rival and childhood friend of Absalom's own Lord Gyr.


#### Escadar

***Main article: [[Escadar]]***
> Escadar is a vital military town located on the [[Isle of Erran]] off Kortos's northern shore. Originally founded as a shipyard and warehouse to aid Absalom against naval blockades, the town quickly grew as workers and naval officers moved to Erran. Beyond its continuing function as a reserve navy for times of siege, the fair-sized military base operates throughout the Inner Sea and as far south as the [[Obari Ocean]] in constant efforts to hamper piracy in the region. Escadar's governing body, the Lesser Council of retired ship captains and young relatives of members of the Absalom Grand Council, has also been known to grant letters of marque to civilian ships committed to fighting piracy in the waters around the Isle of Kortos itself.


### Shadow Absalom

> Every major city on Golarion has its dark mirror opposite on the [[Plane of Shadow]], and none are greater than [[Shadow Absalom]]. Inhabited by [[Fetchling|fetchlings]], various other humanoid races, and intelligent undead, the city is a thriving community of both natives from and visitors to the Shadow. The mirror opposite of the Ascendant Court holds a permanent portal to the Material Plane, making Shadow Absalom a popular destination to those trapped on this plane. The city is ruled by [[Argrinyxia|Argrinyxia the Shifting Lady of Ebon Scales]], a powerful [[Umbral dragon|umbral dragon]].


## Economy

> Absalom's great wealth is driven by trade, so the city's rulers strive to craft policies favorable to commerce (and their own interests), but otherwise take a relatively laissez-faire approach to regulation. Taxes in the city are very light, although Siege Taxes during wartime may be significantly higher. There are no property taxes, although the city charges for access to roads, sanitation, and other public infrastructure. Modest taxes on foreign merchants, fees for pilots through the [[Flotsam Graveyard]], and docking fees, are generally sufficient to supply the city's needs.
> Absalom's economy can be divided into three basic parts: craftsmen, who manufacture goods; traders, who buy and sell physical goods; and laborers, who provide services. While craftsmen and laborers are organized into guilds that provide legal and illegal products and services, traders are prohibited from organizing to prevent collusion and price-fixing. The city's laws require that goods to be sold must be owned by a single merchant, who may operate a single commercial outlet for them. [[List of currenciesAbsalom|Absaloms currency]] consists of pennies, silver weights, crests, gold measures, and platinum sphinxes.
> The city is a major hub for commerce on the [[Inner Sea]], and its most common trading partners include [[Almas]], [[Cassomir]], [[Katheer]], [[Niswan]], [[Okeno]], [[Oppara]], [[Oregent]], [[Ostenso]], and [[Sothis]]. However, Absalom has varying relations with and regulations concerning trade with these cities: for example, [[Almas]] views Absalom's ships as unwelcome bullies, while Vudrani traders from [[Niswan]] are celebrated, and ships from [[Oregent]] must prove they carry only glassware and silverware or face a 100% tariff. Other ships come from all over the world, as far away as [[Tian Xia]]. Absalom acts as a hub for these countries and disseminates these goods to ships on their way to other ports across the Inner Sea.
> Due to Absalom's size and scale, beasts of burden are important elements of the city's commerce and transport. Regular bench-wagons allow commoners to ride around town for a copper, and halfling porters with dog travois can be hired for a similar price. Horses are rare on the [[Isle of Kortos]], since the centaur tribes regard them as invaders and the harpies like to eat them. Consequently, the most prominent beast of burden is the camel; farmers use them for agriculture, drovers use them to pull wagons and chariots, and many district guards field a camel cavalry. Camel barding is more commonly available than barding for horses in the city. After camels, [[Axe beak|axe beaks]] are most common mount and beast of burden, faster and better able to defend themselves than camels. Dogs, lizards, elephants, and monstrous centipedes are also found; before the establishment of [[Hackamore House]], much saddle and tack had to be custom made or ordered from dozens of shops due to the diversity of animals used in the city.


### Exports

> Even though goods from across the world are traded in Absalom, it also has several important exports that originate in and around the Isle of Kortos. Lumber is harvested in the [[Immenwood]] and brought via the [[Deluge River]] to [[Diobel]] or overland to [[Otari]]. Diobel's shallow harbor also has plentiful oyster beds and are considered some of the finest in the [[Inner Sea region]]. [[Iron]] is mined in the Isle of Kortos' interior (most notably in the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] settlement of [[Galizhur]]) and supples Absalom's countless craftspeople that sell their goods across Golarion. Finally, various [[Skymetal|skymetals]] are harvested by [[Low Azlanti]] on the ocean floor or harvested in the Diobel Hills.
> Absalom is famous for its shellfish: oysters, clams, scallops, crabs, and lobster.


## Government

***Main article: [[Government of Absalom]]***
> Absalom is ruled by the [[Grand Council]] which is chaired by the [[Primarch|primarch]], a position currently held by [[Lord Gyr of House Gixx]]. The Council has twelve high seats (including the primarch's) and a variable number of low seats. Most of the city's administrative positions are filled by members of the Council, the more sought after titles going to members of the High Council. The position of primarch is held for life and decided upon by the High Council. It has additional privileges unique to the position granting the holder considerable power over the Council, and by corollary, the City at the Center of the World itself. Much of the day-to-day administration are handled by the [[Government of AbsalomDistrict councils|district councils of Absalom]]. The district councils are headed by a [[Nomarch|nomarch]], who is appointed by the Low Council with the approval of the primarch.


### Military & law enforcement

> Absalom is defended by a complicated web of military and law enforcement organizations, each of which has differing mandates. The [[First Guard]] serves as Absalom's army. They man the city's walls, gates, and forts and protect it from external threats. The [[Starwatch]] is a military, intelligence, and law enforcement organization headquartered at [[Starwatch Keep]] outside the city. They enforce the Grand Council's decrees, investigate crimes that cross district lines, and look into misconduct by the city's other military and law enforcement groups. Absalom's Navy is the largest of the military branches and protects the city from attacks by sea and also oversees the [[Hippocampus|hippocampus-mounted]] [[Wave Riders]]. Finally, the various district guards or watches investigate crimes committed only within the various districts of the city.


## History

![[Absalom_skyline.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 The busy harbor of Absalom.
***Main article: [[History of Absalom]]***
> Founded in [[1 AR]] by the god Aroden when he raised the *[[Starstone]]* from the depths of the Inner Sea, there is nothing ordinary about Absalom's history even from its very first day in existence. Its whole-cloth creation allowed for a quick inhabitation and Aroden tasked the best and bravest from throughout [[Inner Sea region]] to protect the *Starstone* and prevent any from moving it.
> But given Absalom's tactical position in the middle of countless trade routes and its undeniable influence, many ambitious nations or greedy warlords have set their sights upon the walls of the city over the millennia, and the guarding of the city and the *Starstone* within has never been easy. For the past four millennia, the city has been besieged by one army after another, in an attempt to bring Absalom to its knees and wrest control of it from all others. Despite the relentless onslaught, the city has never fallen. Relics of these ongoing wars still litter the plains of the Isle of Kortos surrounding the city (known as the [[Cairnlands]]) and sunken warships clutter the harbor.


## Inhabitants

*For a complete list, please see [[CategoryAbsalomInhabitants]], [[Houses of Absalom]]*
> More so than anywhere else on Golarion, Absalom plays home to every conceivable type of inhabitant. While primarily a [[Human|human]] settlement, members of all races, religions and homelands can be seen in (and under) the streets of the City in the Center of the World. The specific demographics of each individual district vary greatly, but there are few (if any) peoples who are not represented somewhere within the city, even the mysterious [[Gillman|gillmen]] of ancient [[Azlant]] and travelers from other [[Great Beyond|planes]].
> The earliest inhabitants of Absalom were wise and brave nobles, merchants and adventurers from the lands nearest to the Isle of Kortos, thus the influence of the nations of [[Andoran]], Cheliax, [[Osirion]], [[Qadira]], [[Taldor]] and [[Thuvia]] remain most pronounced in the city to this day. Due to influence of nearby [[Osirion]] and [[Qadira]], many of the city's inhabitants speak [[Human languages of GolarionKelish|Kelish]] or [[Human languages of GolarionOsiriani|Osiriani]] in addition to [[Human languages of GolarionCommonTaldane|Taldane]].
> [[Halflings]] are the second largest racial group in the city after the humans making Absalom one of the main halfling settlements in the [[Inner Sea region]]. Halflings from many countries come to Absalom joining the indigenous community. The main halfling districts are [[The Coins]], [[Eastgate]] and the [[Foreign Quarter]]; few halflings live or travel to the [[Puddles]] where the height of the water can be dangerous for them.
> Elves are relatively uncommon in Absalom, mostly consisting of adventurers or outcasts; more common are their half-elven descendants, many of whom can be found around the [[Pleasure Salon of Calistria]].
> Many of Absalom's residents organize themselves into [[Houses of Absalom|houses]], which are similar to clans organized by national origin.


## Religion

> The most common faiths in Absalom are, of course, those of the four ascended gods: Aroden, [[Norgorber]], [[Cayden Cailean]] and [[Iomedae]]. In addition to these churches, temples and shrines to [[Abadar]], [[Nethys]], [[Sarenrae]], [[Calistria]], [[Irori]] and [[Shelyn]] can be found throughout the metropolis. Absalom is also the only civilized city where the worship of [[Norgorber]] is tolerated.
> With this variety of religious institutions all on one place, many services and items are offered. Some of these items include *[[Cathedral pit stone|cathedral pit stones]]* and *[[Whisper safe|whisper safes]]*.


## Symbols

> Absalom's many centuries of immigration have provided it with a dizzying array of guilds, houses, religious and martial orders, and other organizations, each with their own symbols. Absalom as a whole, however, has a number of common symbols. The city's colors are golden yellow (for the *Starstone*) and green (for the sea and the island's lush pastures). Absalom's mascots are the [[Hippocampus|hippocampus]], representing the island's naval power and [[Sea Cavalry]], and the [[Mother-sphinx|mother-sphinx]], imported from [[Osirion]]. Absalom's mother-sphinx is typically presented as a winged lion with a female human head and upper body, and occasionally shown pregnant, astride a wave, or with human hands holding a scale and scepter or scroll. The city's motto is "Ex Prothex", which is interpreted to mean "From the First" or "First Among Equals". Absalom's hybrid nature and long history are reflected some of the in the foreign names for it: the Patchwork City, or the City of Buried Treasures.
