> **Galisemni** is a centre of [[Plane|interplanar]] commerce within the [[Maelstrom]], located on a stable island that floats across the Maelstrom's [[Borderlands]].



## Geography

> Galisemni consists of two major districts, evoking the [[Outer Sphere|Outer]] and [[Inner Sphere|Inner Spheres]] of the [[Great Beyond]]. The Inner Ring is more stable and less densely populated, mostly by elite or wealthy permanent residents. The Outer Ring, which is more affected by the [[Chaos|chaos]] of the Maelstrom, contains houses, tenements, markets, planar [[Portal|portals]], racial ghettos, and the unregulated Mad District, which is simultaneously festival, [[Drug|drug]] den, and [[Art|art]] colony.
> Galisemni's skyline features the Watching Seven, seven [[Keketar|keketar]] statues whose bases are adorned with the following poem:



“

Singing to us the Seven are.Are you appreciative of the silence?Silence everywhere but here.

”

> These statues are avoided by [[Protean|proteans]], but those who open their minds to them claim that they hear songs with titles such as *We of Malignant Symmetry*.
> Another mysterious element of Galisemni is the [[Lethe Wall]], a non-living wall of black stone that moves through the city. Residents view it as [[Curse|cursed]] and temporarily move away when the wall approaches their neighbourhood. When a creature carves its name on the wall, the Lethe Wall consumes that name, erasing all of their traces from history, including their own memories. A rare few retain some or all memories of their previous lives, and call themselves the Wyrmtouched; most of the rest eventually return to society, blissfully ignorant of what they did.


## Government

> Galisemni is ruled and kept from anarchy (if just barely) by a council drawn from guilds and local authority figures, who present a singular front and loose laws to govern and represent the city. On a fractious local scale, influential individuals or groups exert their authority to ensure safety.


## People

> Galisemni's population is wildly diverse, hailing from a cross-section of the [[Plane|planes]]. It is the home to the largest temple and primary place of worship of the [[Protean lord|protean lord]] [[Ssila'meshnik|Ssilameshnik]], who has been described as the Warden of Galisemni.
