> The city of **Misarias** in northeastern [[Cheliax]] stands on the banks of the [[River Keld]] on the [[Isger|Isgeri]] border, and serves as a waypoint for travelers of all sortsâ€”thieves to diplomats, and brigands to scouts. With a suspicious eye on [[Andoran]] and [[Molthune]], and with memories of the [[Goblinblood Wars]] ever in mind, [[Abrogail Thrune II|Her Infernal Majestrixs]] generals keep most of the nation's massive army stationed in the region, where they could hold back an invasion ere reinforcements could come across the [[Fields of Chelam]] or the [[Sirmium Plains]] to aid them. Despite the large military presence, rumors hold that agents of the [[Molthune Armsrunners]], a mercenary group operating out of [[Logas]] in Isger, keep rooms in Misarias where the organization is recruiting guards, customers, and scouts within Cheliax's borders.
