> Home to the [[Jadwiga]] ("children of the witch-mother"), the descendants of the witch [[Baba Yaga]], **Whitethrone** was a playground for evil nobles under the 100-year reign of previous [[Elvanna|Queen Elvannas]] family. This has changed since the ascent of Elvanna's successor, [[Anastasia Nikolaevna|Queen Anastasia]], in [[4713 AR]].



## Description

> The city is located on tall cliffs overlooking the northeastern shores of [[Glacier Lake]], and contains tall towers and domed buildings, some of them carved of ice that never melts. The main street running to the queen's palace is known as the Bone Road, and is paved with the skulls of those who died in the [[Winter War]], and occasionally repaired or extended with the bones of those who displease the [[White Witches]].


## Inhabitants

> The city is home to [[Snow goblin|snow goblins]], [[Ice troll|ice trolls]], and even [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]] and [[Worg|worgs]], all of them with the same rights as [[Human|humans]]. Visitors must beware, for Baba Yaga cast a spell on the Howlings district that allows the lupines to walk in human form to more easily interact with the two-legged population. The people of Whitethrone know better than to hunt wolves outside the city, or insult the shaggy-haired men and women whose breaths fog the air on even the warmest days.


## Government

> Queen Elvanna's eldest daughter, Princess Cassisoche, was the duchess of the province of [[Thronehold]] and ruler of the capital city of Whitethrone .


> [[Paizo]] published a panoramic image of Whitethrone on p. 18 of *[[People of the North]]*, and a four-panel poster map in the *[[City Map Folio]]*.
