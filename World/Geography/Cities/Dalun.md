> Located in the south of the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of [[Wintercrux]] on the [[Thundering River]], **Dalun** is a small trade town that does business with the outside world.
> Though Dalun strongly encourages trade with the outside world, which is essential for Irrisen's survival, its diplomatic efforts are ruined because of the Irriseni raids launched from [[Redtooth]] and [[Saarbotten]] in the [[Verge]] to the west. Indeed, Dalun is derisively called 'Gentle Dalun' by the people of Saarbotten despite the fact that Dalun supplies most of Saarbotten's food.
> [[Nadya|Baroness Nadya]] is the ruler of Dalun. She has tried to foster stable trading relations with [[Southmoor]] and [[Varisia]] but not with great success. Dalun is responsible for supplying Redtooth and Saarbotten with grain and other foodstuffs. Nadya's bloodthirsty sister, [[Urgalaena]], baroness of Saarbotten, often sabotages Nadya's diplomatic attempts. Lady Nadya's chief steward, [[Betrona Harcatha]], is actually a spy for her sister Urgalaena.
