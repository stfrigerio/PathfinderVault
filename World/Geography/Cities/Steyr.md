> **Steyr** is an inland town in far-eastern [[Andoran]] on the [[Carpenden Plains]], approximately 150 miles west of the [[River Sellen|Sellen River]]. It houses a large community of expatriates from the tumultuous nation of [[Galt]], many of them artists and philosophers.


## Geography

> This town of clay brick homes is surrounded by a tall plaster wall decorated with murals depicting heroes of Galt's [[Red Revolution]].


## Economy

> The artists, writers, philosophers, and poets living in Steyr have transformed the town into a haven of free expression. Its residents produce challenging and stunning works of fiction and art that have become quite popular among Andoran's educated middle class. Much of the money that is generated is sent back to their families still in Galt, a practice that stirs up some controversy in Andoran. The government supports helping those in need, but worries that the funds will only prolong the bloody conflict in that once-great nation. This does not stop them from taking advantage of the additional intelligence brought in by the expatriates. The local [[People's Council|councilor]], [[Maya Cartson]], also uses her position in the government to funnel intelligence about Galt to her constituents in Steyr.
