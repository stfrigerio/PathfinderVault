## Description

> At one time, this was an innocuous hamlet. Its increased status has not led to any kind of civic improvement; its buildings are mostly run down, and the streets between them are foul with refuse and worse. The best buildings are built upon a wharf upon the [[Sellen River]]. The current marquis, [[Urdul Bazzak]], makes his residence in a rundown manor house, and his guards enjoy drowning trespassers in the river.
> It is here that river traffic (apart from those vessels belonging to the various River Kingdoms) must pay a toll in order to obtain safe passage to and from [[Numeria]]. The wharf is defended by [[Wylia Greensword]], a steadfast supporter of the Black Marquis and Captain of the *[[Seabitch]]*.
