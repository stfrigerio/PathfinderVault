> **Yled** (pronounced EH-lehd) is the largest city in the land of [[Geb's Rest]] and also home to most of its [[Undead|undead]] armies.


## Geography

> Yled is located the north-eastern part of the country near the border with the [[Mana Wastes]], and less than 50 miles inland from the [[Obari Ocean]]. The city is surrounded by the [[Bonewall]], a curtain wall made entirely of bleached bones, which the local [[Blood Lord]] can animate for defense.


## Schools of magic

> Yled is also home to a number of important [[Necromancy|necromantic]] colleges, the most well-known being the [[Mortuarium]]. Miles below this structure, in a drained aquifer, the [[Necromancer|necromancers]] of Geb have bound (or convinced) a trio of [[Nightshade|nightshades]] to serve as a permanent well of necromantic energy for the city in a time of war. The most powerful of these is a creature simply known as the Bound One.
> These schools also attract [[Arcanist|arcanists]], who travel to Geb to join the ranks of researchers known as the [[Twilight Sages]].
