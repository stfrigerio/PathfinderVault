> On the shores of [[Katapesh]], north from the metropolis of [[Katapesh city|Katapesh]], Driftwood seems an inhospitable inlet ringed by sheer-walled cliffs. Jagged rocks protruding from the surf increase its treacherous appearance from the sea. Those familiar with the area, though, know how to navigate around the rocks and into the inlet, where a shallow, sheltered cove is revealed. While it is relatively unknown among the trade ships and slave galleys of the area, smugglers and pirates of the region are better informed.
