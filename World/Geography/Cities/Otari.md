> 
> **Otari** is a small port town near the [[Immenwood]] on the south coast of the [[Isle of Kortos]], about halfway between [[Absalom]] and [[Diobel]]. It is located at the head of a bay of the [[Inner Sea]]. It is a modern but relatively quiet settlement, and is popular among retired [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]], many of whom operate businesses there. Important to the economy of Absalom as a whole is Otari's lumber trade: timber cut from the Immenwood arrives by road into Otari and, from there, is traded across the [[Inner Sea region]].
