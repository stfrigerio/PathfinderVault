## Competition for the *sun orchid elixir*

## History

> In the early 47th century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]], fortified Aspenthar was attacked by an infamous [[Pirate|pirate]], the [[Free Captains|Free Captain]] Cyrus Wolfe. He had terrorized the [[Garund|Garundi]] coast for years, but striking the city was his most outrageous act so far. In a daylight raid, he captured over 100 of Aspenthar's citizens to be sold as [[Slave|slaves]], and left a dozen [[Ship|ships]] of the city's defensive fleet in flames. For this daring and audacious act, he was awarded the Hurricane Crown by his fellow Free Captains of the [[Shackles]]. Wolfe was later captured by a flotilla of ships commissioned as privateers by the queen of Aspenthar the the [[Pactmasters]] of [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]]. He was sentenced to death for his crimes and hanged from a gibbet over the city's harbor.
