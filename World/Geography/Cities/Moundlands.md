> The **Moundlands**, located near the confluence of the [[Whitegold River|Whitegold]] and [[Vyalldehun River|Vyalldehun Rivers]], is where the early [[Linnorm King|Linnorm Kings]] were buried. Here, scores of small burial mounds surround 99 larger hills, 50 feet in height, each one of which contains a buried burial complex. The larger hills house the graves of the Linnorm Kings, while the smaller ones contain their champions or lesser nobles. The area is now avoided by all, as the kings animated in their cairns after the 99th one was laid to rest here.
