> **Hyrantam**, the Drowned City, was once the capital of [[Lirgen]], in what today is known as the [[Sodden Lands]]. The [[Saoc Brethren]] built hundreds of towers for use as observatories. The coming of the [[Eye of Abendego]] drowned the city, but the tops of the towers remain above the water. The city's remaining population live atop the towers, which they have connected with a crude network of rope bridges and pulleys. For some reason, [[Sorted Traits/creature/aberration|aberrations]] from the depths of the [[Arcadian Ocean]] are drawn to these observatories, so the city is a dangerous place.


> [[Paizo]] set the adventure *[[Seers of the Drowned City]]* in Hyrantam, which also included an appendix about the town.
