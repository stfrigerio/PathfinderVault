> **Shoreline** is a small town located just outside the never-breached walls of [[Absalom]], directly west of the [[City districts of Absalom|district]] called [[Puddles|the Puddles]]. It began as a settlement for those who make their living from the sea, illustrated by its many docks and fisheries, but is also home to some of Absalom's more fragrant businesses, such as tanneries and breweries. General artisans and laborers are also found here aplenty. Most of Shoreline's inhabitants are quite poor, although they comfort themselves with the fact that at least they are dry most of the time, unlike the people who live in the Puddles.
> The siege castle called the [[Pyramid of the Dog]] is located on a beach just south of Shoreline.
