> The **Foreign Quarter** is the [[City districts of Absalom|city district]] in which much of [[Absalom|Absaloms]] non-native population resides, and entire neighborhoods there take on the flavor and character of distant lands. It lies on Absalom's west side, sandwiched between the [[Ivy District]] and [[Wise Quarter]] to the north, the [[Ascendant Court]] and [[Coins]] to the east, the [[Docks]] and [[Puddles]] to the south, and [[Westgate]] to the west. The lower taxes for non-citizens in this section of the city have made it quite popular for immigrants from the rest of the [[Inner Sea region]] and beyond. Foreign merchants with businesses find the area particularly attractive due to an equivalent extension of "citizenry protection" offered to any resident of the Foreign Quarter who has lived there more than three months. This area of the city has a distinct, culturally exotic feel, even compared to the city as a whole.


## Places of interest

> The neighborhood's premier attraction is the [[Irorium]], a coliseum that hosts gladiatorial combats, staged sea-battles, religious festivals, and many other types of events, and is said to be the largest open-air arena in the Inner Sea region. A nearby tavern, the [[Crimson Coin]], runs a bustling trade with the gamblers and gladiators of the Irorium. The [[Pathfinder Society|Pathfinder Societys]] massive fortress, the [[Grand Lodge]], is also located here, as is the [[Wounded Wisp]], one of the bars at which the Society was founded in [[4307 AR]].
