> **Kokutang** was the capital of [[Yamasa]], one of the two lost kingdoms that now make up the [[Sodden Lands]]. The city was destroyed by the [[Eye of Abendego]]. Today there is a town on the surface, with a complex of caves and passages beneath, most of which are flooded.
> The site is a seasonal gathering place for the [[Koboto]], the cannibalistic descendants of the people of Yamasa; visitors risk being eaten.
