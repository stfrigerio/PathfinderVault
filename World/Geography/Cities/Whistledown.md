> The town of **Whistledown** is one of the few settlements in [[Varisia]] not affiliated with either [[Korvosa]] or [[Magnimar]], though it is located almost exactly halfway between the two larger cities.  Founded at the western edge of the [[Fenwall Mountains]], where [[Lake Syrantula]] flows back into the [[Yondabakari River]], the town is known primarily as the heart of the [[Gnome|gnome]] population in [[Varisia]], despite the fact that it contains just as many [[Human|humans]] as gnomes. Nevertheless, much of the town's buildings and its white-walled cottages are sized for gnomes. Its name derives from the strange wooden charms which produce haunting melodies in the night winds off the lake, and this nightly music tends to put off most non-gnome visitors.


## Industry

> Whistledown is a common resting spot on the [[Dry Way]] for merchants and caravans. Its most renowned export is fine quality [[Musical instrument|musical instruments]], made by some of the finest artisans in [[Avistan]].
