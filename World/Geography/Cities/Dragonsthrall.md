> **Dragonsthrall** is the only settlement on the island of [[Dahak's Horn|Dahaks Horn]]. The island of Dahak's Horn was chosen by the great [[Dragon|dragon]]-priest [[Aashaq]] when she first came to the isles of the [[Shackles]], for her loyal [[Humanoid|humanoid]] worshipers to inhabit. 


## Description

> Dragonsthrall is a confusing collection of structures made of stones, wood, and mud, gathered on a wide bay open to the dangerous Straits of Aashaq. Over the centuries the settlement has been destroyed many times by [[Aashaq]], her minions, its own residents, and crusaders trying to eradicate the despicable [[Cult of Dahak]], and a new town has been rebuilt on the rubble of the old. The current Dragonsthrall was built after Aashaq herself torched the last one in [[4695 AR]].
> The chief priest of the [[Temple of Dahak Dragonsthrall|Dragonsthrall temple]] is [[Anneshalli Suwaat]], a squat, beady-eyed [[Osirion|Osirian]] bully who often abuses his authority over the town's inhabitants. He answers only to [[Houkna Bewul]], brutal master of the town and captain of the [[Frigate|frigate]] *[[Black Dragon ship|Black Dragon]]*. The docks of Dragonsthrall boasts two taverns, the [[Smoky Embers]] and the [[Bagog's Roundhouse|Bagogs Roundhouse]].
