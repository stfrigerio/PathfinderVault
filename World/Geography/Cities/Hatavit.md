> The settlement of **Hatavit** is a small work camp located in [[Qadira]], south of the [[Tapur Forest|Northern Tapur Forest]]. Designed to house [[Slave|slaves]] who harvest the bounty of the nearby forest, the town was also a post for woodworkers and carvers.
> Recently, a severe sandstorm struck the townâ€”an unusual event for the region. It destroyed the town's watchtowers and drove away its guards. The unsupervised slaves fled northeast into the forest to escape their captors, and [[Katheer]] has had no contact with the town since.
