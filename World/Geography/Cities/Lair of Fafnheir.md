> Dread [[Fafnheir]] is said to be the mightiest and oldest [[Linnorm|linnorm]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], and he has existed for as long as the [[Linnorm Kingdoms]] themselves. The ** Lair of Fafnheir ** is located deep in the [[Grungir Forest]]. A legend exists that whoever slays Fafnheir will become king of all the [[Ulfen]], and unite the squabbling kingdoms into a single nation.
