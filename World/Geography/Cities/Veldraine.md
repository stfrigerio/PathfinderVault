> The town of **Veldraine** is perhaps the most important strategic holding of [[Korvosa]], and the second-oldest [[Chelaxian]] settlement in [[Varisia]]. Located at the mouth of [[Conqueror's Bay|Conquerors Bay]], Veldraine's [[Ship|ships]] make up most of the Korvosan Navy, and its naval academy trains most of the city-state's sailors and captains. It also contains a giant winch that allows the military to pull an immense chain taut across the entrance to the bay, keeping invading navies or [[Pirate|pirates]] out of the watersâ€”or trapped within it to be dispatched one by one. The chain is inspected monthly by Korvosan officials, and has only been used once in [[4685 AR]] in order to fight pirates from [[Riddleport]].


## Economy

> Veldraine depends on Korvosa for trade and support, just as the larger city depends on Veldraine for naval protection.


## Cult of Ghlaunder

> A small **cult of the [[Ghlaunder|Gossamer King]]** is said to reside outside the town, hidden in an ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] ruin where they breed a race of [[Poison|poisonous]] [[Stirge|stirges]] and wait to release them against those who do not follow their god.
