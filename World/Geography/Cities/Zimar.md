> One of the main defensive [[Taldor|Taldan]] strongholds against any future invasion from the south, **Zimar** is vital to the long term survival of the nation. Even though the war with [[Qadira]], the [[Grand Campaign]], ended over 100 years ago, Zimar still serves as a bastion for the Taldan army and is home to several [[Taldan Phalanx]] regiments (the name given to one of their huge formations of heavy infantry) and several other formations including cavalry and capital ships. Even though Taldor has not been openly at war with its southern neighbor since [[4079 AR]], the city remains ever watchful and is the most heavily fortified settlement in Taldor.



## Geography

> Zimar sits on the banks of [[Jalrune River]], near the border between Taldor and Qadira, and is the nation's third-largest city. The Jalrune is navigable by large ocean-going vessels all the way to Zimar.  To the south-west, the river flows through the spider-infested [[Border Wood]], which can be dangerous to travelers due to the bandits that also live within the woodland.


### The Undercity

> Zimar's undercity is "ruled" by the self-proclaimed [[Otyugh|otyugh]] king [[Gulreesh]], Lord of Filth. The Lord of Filth holds court in a large cistern and rumors suggest that he devours any who offend him. The rulers above ground take no action against Gulreesh, nor his allies. Some claim that this is because he holds a terrible secret about the rulers, while others argue it is because he is too inconsequential.


## Culture

> Zimar stands as a military stronghold in defense of Taldor, yet the city itself possesses an architecture and a culture with both Qadiran and Taldan influences. Regardless, Qadira is the foe here, and her enslavement of the inhabitants of Zimar at the start of the [[Grand Campaign]] has not been forgotten. Disciplined, nationalistic pride is taught throughout the city and military service is upheld as the highest calling.


### Religion

> The largest house of worship in Zimar is undoubtedly the [[Abadar|Abadaran]] temple, the House of Gold, a gilded cathedral surrounded by the largest garden in the city. It is here that the elite paramilitary unit known as the Golden Templars are trained.
> Although worship of the Qadiran goddess [[Sarenrae]] was again legalized in Taldor in [[4603 AR]], abandoned places of worship can still be found throughout the nation. Some of her largest, secret temples can be found in Zimar, probably due to the city's proximity to Qadira.
