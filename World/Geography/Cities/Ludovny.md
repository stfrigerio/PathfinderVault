> **Ludovny** is a small town north of the [[Hoarwood Forest]] in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of [[Hoarwood province|Hoarwood]]. The town has been the main supplier of Hoarwood's provincial capital for centuries and has managed to maintain its position using political machinations and a river of bribes. [[Natalka Aelena|Countess Natalka Aelena]] uses any means necessary to preserve Ludovny's lucrative trade status. Her two sons, [[Laszlo]] and [[Ludvak]] pull the strings of the [[Bitter Brotherhood]], the gang of bandits who plague the trade routes from [[Lod]] and [[Dammartorp]] to [[Hoarwood]]. The countess's youngest daughter, Bozidara is also involved in Natalka's diplomatic efforts. Bozidara lives in Hoarwood, attending the endless parties of the [[Anelisha|Duchess Anelisha]], whispering poisoned words and slipping bribes into the hands of key officials and merchants. The town itself welcomes the merchant visitors with cosy inns, rousing taverns, two extravagant brothels, and a busy theater called the [[Brenezoi]] which hosts performers from the southern lands of the [[Inner Sea]].
