> **Crying Leaf** is an isolated [[Elf|elven]] village in [[Varisia]]'s [[Mierani Forest]]. It is a day's travel from the ruins of the former elf city of [[Celwynvian]], where the elves are engaged in a bitter struggle with the [[Drow|drow]]. As a result, it is used by the elves as a staging ground for their warriors, including contingents of [[Lantern Bearers]], and is not entirely safe from drow raids.
> The village consists mainly of simple, low stone and wooden structures, decorated with graceful carvings. It is protected by a wall of thorns. Most of the village's trade and supplies arrive from [[Kyonin]] through the use of magic â€“ there is little contact with [[Riddleport]] and the rest of neighbouring Varisia. Non-elven visitors are rare.
> The leader of the village is the sorcerer [[Eviana Nirgassan]], who was appointed by Kyonin a decade ago following the assassination of her predecessor by the drow.
