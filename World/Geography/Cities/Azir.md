> **Azir**, the capital of [[Rahadoum]] and birthplace of the [[Laws of Mortality]], is a somber city whose appearance has been greatly modified recently. New buildings have unlikely and drastic angles making it appear as if the builders are trying to free their work from the confines of geometry much like the members of the city freed themselves from the confines of the edicts of [[Deity|gods]] long ago.  At the same time newer buildings' exteriors have been coated in colorful paints while also having gargoyles added on the same buildings.
> Despite being known to foreigners as **Port Godless**, Azir often serves as neutral ground for representatives of various religious sects for meetings or negotiations. Strange paranormal activity sometimes results from invisible wars between [[Celestial|celestials]] and [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]] preferring to do battle where no local bias from [[Mortal|mortal]] inhabitants will interfere.


## Economy

> Azir has a burgeoning economy fueled by profitable new trade contacts and local innovation. The [[Aspis Consortium]], a transnational trade organization with interests throughout the [[Inner Sea region]], seems to be aware of this, and has placed their regional headquarters in the city.


## Politics

> Under the surface, battles are fought between the country's [[Atheism|atheistic]] [[Pure Legion]] and many seditious cults attempting to overturn the godlessness of the country.
