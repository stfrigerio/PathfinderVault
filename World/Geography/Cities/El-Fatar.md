> A [[Pathfinder]] discovered an enormous set of catacombs beneath a ruined city of [[Ancient Osirion]], in northern [[Katapesh]]. [[Adventurer|Adventurers]] came to the ruined city to explore the ancient tunnels and over time the small town of **El-Fatar** sprang up amidst the ruins. The intriguing [[Artifact|artifacts]] discovered attracted many researchers and historians as well.


## Economy

> Local residents trade primarily in the supplies most valuable to those that explore the catacombs, such as spelunking gear, maps and trail rations, as well as any relics, pottery or artifacts that the returning adventurers recover. 
> With the discovery of a third layer to the catacombs, it appears El-Fatar's economy will remain stable for the foreseeable future.
