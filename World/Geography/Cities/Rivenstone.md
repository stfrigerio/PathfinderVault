> **Rivenstone** is a submerged mountain within the [[Broken Bay]] region of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] that causes great trouble to passing [[Ship|ships]]. Rivenstone rises up from the depth of one of the deepest valleys of the [[Steaming Sea]], splitting on its way up into seven separate peaks. The highest two peaks reach just below the sea's surface except at the lowest tides when they poke above the tideline; they are known to local sailors but seem to have a knack for sinking visiting ships. Another danger is the presence of a [[Dagon]]-worshipping tribe of [[gutaki]]: intelligent [[Devilfish|devilfish]]. They are led by a cabal of a dozen priests, a mix of [[Cleric|clerics]] and [[Oracle|oracles]], who use charmed [[Octopus|giant octopuses]] and [[Giant squid|squid]] to bolster their tribe making them one of the deadliest threats to dwell within Broken Bay.
