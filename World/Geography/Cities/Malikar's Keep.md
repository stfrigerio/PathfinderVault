> **Malikar's Keep** is the lair of the [[Plane|plane]]-walking [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] [[Xegirius Malikar]]. The castle sits atop an island of weathered bedrock that floats in the void of the [[Negative Energy Plane]]. Most of the stone of the island has been worn away by the plane's destructive energies, yet what remains bears some resemblance to the rocks that float within [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Solar system|solar system]] in the zone known as the [[Diaspora]].
