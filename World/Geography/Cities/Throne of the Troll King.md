> The **Throne of the Troll King** is a huge stone chair atop a high hill near the [[Kodar Mountains]], which is located in the [[Southmoor]] region of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. Legends claim that by sitting on the throne overnight at [[Solstice|midwinter]], one could gain dominion over all of Southmoor's [[Troll|trolls]] until the following midwinter's eve. Consequently, dozens of troll tribes guard the area around the throne to ensure that nobody attempts to prove the legend true.
