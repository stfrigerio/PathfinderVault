> **Pilgrimage** is a small but growing port town in the nation of [[Razmiran]], on the northeastern shores of [[Lake Encarthan]].


## History

> The town began as a roadside tavern on the road between [[Xer]] on the [[Glass River]] and the new capital of [[Thronestep]] farther up the coast. It has since expanded into a small town with a dozen inns, a large temple to [[Razmir]], a functioning port, and a rapidly developing black market.


## Underground economy

> Pilgrimage is the main Razmiri town for those wishing to do business out of sight of the [[Church of Razmir]], or at least without their direct interference. Although most business is still conducted with their knowledge, a growing amount takes place without their approval. Those found conducting business in this manner are severely punished, and are sent to the prison-mine known as the [[Forgotten Track]] or worse. Pilgrimage nevertheless remains a hotbed of Razmiri citizens who wish for a life away from the [[Razmir|Masked Gods]] harsh rule.
