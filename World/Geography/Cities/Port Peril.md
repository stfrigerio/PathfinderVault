> 
> **Port Peril** is the largest port in the [[Shackles]] and its *de facto* capital. It is situated on the [[Port Peril and the Mainland|mainland]], rather than on one of the outlying islands, on the edge of the [[Terwa Uplands]] and overlooking [[Jeopardy Bay]]. The city is protected by walls, and the stronghold of [[Fort Hazard]]. All manner of vices can be found in its twisting streets, and its busy markets thrive on the sale of stolen goods. Rumour has it that the plunder from decades of [[Pirate|piracy]] is hidden in sea caves beneath the city.
> Despite being the capital of the [[Shackles Pirates]], [[Ship|merchant ships]] sometimes dock here to trade. Those flying the flags of [[Inner Sea region]] nations are not welcome, and gain no protection, but unaligned vessels are permitted to dock.



## Government

> The city is ruled by [[Kerdak Bonefist|Captain Kerdak Bonefist the Hurricane King]], lord of the [[Shackles Pirates]]. During his frequent absences, the affairs of the city are jointly overseen by [[Sabas Odabio]], harbourmaster [[Tsojmin Kreidoros]] and master merchant [[Pherias Jakar]].


## City districts

> Though a pirate city is difficult to neatly compartmentalize, there are certain areas of the city of Port Peril that might classify as city districts:

> - [[Beggarbriar]]
> - [[Crescent Harbor|CrescentÂ Harbor]]
> - Eastwind: [[High Eastwind|HighÂ Eastwind]] & [[Low Eastwind|LowÂ Eastwind]]
> - [[Knotworks|TheÂ Knotworks]]
> - [[Lucrehold]]
> - [[Merchant Marina|MerchantÂ Marina]]
> - [[Scrimshaw]]

## Places of interest

> The harbour is deep enough to accommodate even the largest and most heavily laden of vessels. Visitors to Port Peril are required to dock at the Crescent Harbor, which is overseen by surly harbour-master [[Tsojmin Kreidoros]]. There, their vessels have their cargoes inspected before they are allowed to continue on to the main docks.
> The city's poorest (and often, toughest) inhabitants live in the Beggarbriar district. Many of them earn a living crafting ropes, sails and other nautical supplies.
> Eastwind is another well-known district, and is home to both rich and poor.  It is built on the bluffs overlooking the city, and is divided into Low and High Eastwind.
> Kerdak Bonefist makes his home in the fortress of [[Lucrehold]], on the bluffs above [[Besmara's Beacon|Besmaras Beacon]], the city's lighthouse.


## Inhabitants

*See also: [[CategoryPort PerilInhabitants]]*
> [[Human|Humans]], [[Half-elves|half-elves]] and [[Half-orcs|half-orcs]] make up the majority of the city's inhabitants.
> However, Port Peril is also one of the main [[Halfling|halfling]] settlements in the [[Inner Sea]] region. Here halfling pirates and brigadiers roam the seas freely, many having fought for their freedom from [[Slavery|slavery]] from their previous owners. Halfling captains may offer halflings on captured ships the *bloody choice*: become slaves again or turn on their current masters and join the captain's crew as pirates with full rights and equality.


## Threats

> Port Peril faces many perils itself both natural and political, including the forces of [[Law|law]] from [[Avistan|Avistani]] nations, unaligned pirates, and supernatural storms blowing from the [[Eye of Abendego]].
