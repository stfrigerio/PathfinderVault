> **Moonwing's Bough** is a small pocket of oak trees in the evergreen [[Grungir Forest]] which hosts an ancient shrine to [[Desna]] built thousands of years ago, during the reign of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian Empire]]. The shrine is one of the most sacred sites of Desna's faith but very few worshipers attempt to visit it, traveling through the dangerous Grungir Forest. Moonwing's Bough is named after the first priest of Desna who reached the shrine in the modern age. The shrine is preserved in very good condition.
