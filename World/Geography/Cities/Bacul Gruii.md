> The village of **Bacul Gruii** was taken over by Petchki, a foreign merchant, who enslaved the locals to harvest wood and livestock for his band of mercenaries. Petchki's men slew [[Otok]], the village chief, and mounted his head in the town square to keep the villagers afraid. Petchki pays the villagers next to nothing and only does so to avoid violating the fifth [[River Freedoms|River Freedom]] prohibiting [[Slavery|slavery]]. To legitimize his rule over Bacul Gruii, the mercenary captain plans to marry one of Otok's daughters and declare himself the new village chief.
