> The [[Galt|Galtan]] city of **Azurestone** takes its name from a the massive blue menhir that towers 100 feet above the town. Located on the plains north of the [[Boarwood]], Azurestone has been relatively isolated from Galt's revolutionary fervour until recently. The stone is an object of religious reverence to the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] of the nearby [[Fog Peaks]], who believe it to be a [[Spear|spear]] that was thrown down from [[Heaven]] in prehistoric times by their patron god [[Torag]]. These dwarves make regular pilgrimages to Azurestone, pumping up the local economy. Rumors of hidden chambers beneath the stone are beginning to attract [[Adventurer|adventurers]] and other undesirables to the city, who have also brought Galt's infamous revolutionary spirit with them.
> A trade route links the city with nearby [[Edme]]. Azurestone's patron deity is [[Erastil]], but most of the benign gods are honoured by the citizens. The locals are mostly farmers and miners. Ordinarily, the city's location would make it subject to harsh winters, but these are mitigated by the influence of a relic known as the *[[Vernal Key]]*.
