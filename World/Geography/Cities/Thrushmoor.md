> The settlement of **Thrushmoor** can be found in the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Versex]].  A fishing community on [[Lake Encarthan|Lake Encarthans]] [[Avalon Bay]], the town is known to harbor a significant number of followers of the unsavory [[Old Cults]], and the equally unsavoury [[Night Heralds]].



## History

> Many millennia ago, during the [[Age of Serpents]], a storm of [[Hastur|Hastur-worshipping]] [[Flying polyp|flying polyps]] landed on [[Golarion]], hoping to infest it with the [[Great Old One]] [[Xhamen-Dor]]. They established two cities here: one at the current site of Thrushmoor, and the other named Neruzavin in [[Casmaron]]. The former was destroyed by the [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]] in a massive battle that destroyed both armies, leaving only the *[[Star Stelae]]* as a reminder of their conflict.


### Thrushmoor vanishing

> Seven hundred years ago, every resident of Thrushmoor mysteriously disappeared in an event known as the Thrushmoor Vanishing. The town was eventually resettled, but to this day its inhabitants believe that the area is cursed or haunted by something called the Briarstone Witch.


### Briarstone Witch

> Tired of listening to the rumors about the Briarstone Witch, Count Haserton Lowls I of Versex invited the [[Pharasma|Church of Pharasma]] to travel to [[Briarstone Isle]] and perform an elaborate exorcism.


> [[Paizo]] published an article about Thrushmoor in *[[The Thrushmoor Terror]]*, and the town is also the adventure's setting.
