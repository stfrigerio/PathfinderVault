> **Udayasankar** is a small, relatively insignificant village located in the northern reaches of the [[Golden Basin]] region of the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]]. The most notable thing about the village of Udayasankar is that nearby sits a cave which still contains the [[Stone Egg of Jayalakshmi]]. The Stone Egg of Jayalakshmi is an incredibly powerful [[Artifact|artifact]]; during the ancient era of the [[Age of Destiny]], the stone opened the minds of the first [[Monk|monks]] to find it.
