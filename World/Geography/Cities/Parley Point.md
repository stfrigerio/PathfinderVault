> The surprisingly welcoming port of **Parley Point** is on the coast of the [[Shackles Mainland|Garundi mainland]] region of the [[Shackles]]. It is a popular port of call for merchant captains travelling north, who often stop off here before braving the storms of the [[Eye of Abendego]]. It is renowned for its friendly citizens and fine inns (and brothels).
> The Parley Point lighthouse warns passing vessels of the nearby reefs and dangerous surf. The crews of those vessels that do run aground are rescued by the town's fleet of [[Galley|galleys]].
> However, what the sailors fail to realise is that the town also has a second, false lighthouse further inland, that is sometimes used to fool captains into running aground. The citizens rescue these sailors in the same way as the others, but also surreptitiously make off with as much of their cargo as they can salvage.
