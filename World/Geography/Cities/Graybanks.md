> **Graybanks** is an abandoned [[Nirmathas|Nirmathi]] town south of [[Kraggodan]].


## History

> During the early days of the [[Freedom War]] (as the Nirmathi call their war of independence from [[Molthune]]), Graybanks' citizens were forced to flee their homes due to the nearby combat. With the war spilling out from the forests, the civilians attempted to flee by the river. Caught in a flash flood, dozens died, and the rest never returned. Despite no living soul residing in Graybanks for nearly 70 years, the remains of the town are mysteriously well kept.
