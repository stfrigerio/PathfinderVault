> **Purt** is a small settlement located along the [[Eldress River]] in [[Nirmathas]]. Protected on all sides by a wall of thorns 20 feet high and eight feet thick, the hamlet's [[Human|human]] farmers grow the largest cabbages in the region. Purt's citizens know the several hidden passages through the wall of thorns. The [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of [[Acorn's Rest|Acorns Rest]] helped build the wall to protect the inhabitants from [[Molthune|Molthuni]] mercenaries.
