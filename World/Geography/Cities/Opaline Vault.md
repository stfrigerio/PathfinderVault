> The **Opaline Vault** is the centre of the [[Shaitan|shaitan]] Peerless Empire, and the seat of power of [[Ashadieeyah bint Khalid|Sultana Ashadieeyah bint Khalid]], ruler of the shaitan race.
> It is built on the inner surfaces of a 30-mile crystal geode, and is the largest settlement in the [[Plane of Earth]]. Buildings rise from the floor, walls, and ceilings, linked by bridges of bronze and steel. The light of countless glowing spheres is reflected and refracted many times by the surfaces of the geode, creating an unforgettable sight.
