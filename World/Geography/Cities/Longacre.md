> The town of **Longacre** in central [[Cheliax]] stands on the [[Fields of Chelam]] near the western edge of the [[Whisperwood]] and forms the regional centre of the **Archbarony of Longacre** within the [[Archduchy of the Heartlands]]. Some believe that it is a gathering place for Chelish military veterans who have been censured for openly (or privately) criticizing the government or [[House Thrune]].


> [[Paizo]] published a major article about Longacre in *[[The Hellfire Compact]]*, and the town is the adventure's setting.
