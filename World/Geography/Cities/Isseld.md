> **Isseld** is a minor town on the [[Frozen Road River|Frozen Road]] in [[Irrisen|Irrisens]] [[Feyfrost]] province where most people earn their living from the trade on the river. The settlement has recently become known as the center of the trade in "primitive wares", mostly carved fetishes and talismans crafted by the [[Kellid]] barbarians of the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]].
