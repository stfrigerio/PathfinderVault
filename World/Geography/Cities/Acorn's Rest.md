> **Acorn's Rest** is a small village located in the portion of the [[Fangwood]] south of the [[Marideth River]] in [[Nirmathas]]. Most of its residents are [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] attempting to maintain the forest during the nation's war with [[Molthune]].
> The druids of Acorn's Rest are friendly and open to visitors who respect the Fangwood.


## Government

> Acorn's Rest is run by the druid [[Duskwater]], though most don't share her beliefs about the [[Eye of Abendego]] being a child of [[Gozreh]].
> The village's druids research a cure for the nearby [[Dark Grove]], which resident [[Androssana]] believes is [[Abyss|Abyssal]] in nature.
