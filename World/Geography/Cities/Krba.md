> Because of their insanely chaotic nature, [[Dero|dero]] generally do not congregate in large numbers or have much to do with the other races of the [[Darklands]]. The one exception to this is the town of **Krba**, located in the realm of [[Nar-Voth]] not far from the [[Drow|drow]] city of [[Delvingulf]].



## Geography

> Built in the rubble of an abandoned [[Dwarf|dwarven]] city, ruined long ago in a forgotten earthquake, the dero prosper here, growing their crops of [[Cytillesh|cytillesh]].


## Inhabitants

> Although the majority of the town's population is dero, Krba also contains a large minority of allied [[Morlock|morlocks]]. In what is even more unusual for members of their race, the inhabitants of Krba maintain trading relationships with other denizens of the Darklands, including the drow of [[Sekamina]], and even the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] capital city of [[Egorian]]. A few of the decadent noble families of that city have contacts with the dero and use them to disappear unwanted individuals from time to time.


## Government

> Krba is ruled by the strangely tall savant [[Kivkord]], a visionary mystic who dreams of transforming Krba into the first real city of his people.
