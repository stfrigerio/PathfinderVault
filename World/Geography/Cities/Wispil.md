> Located in the depths of the [[Verduran Forest]], **Wispil** is the [[Gnome|gnomish]] city responsible for most of [[Taldor|Taldors]] supply of timber and much of its wood craft. Wispil provides the timber that fuels the bustling [[Imperial Naval Shipyards|shipyards]] of [[Cassomir]], which in turn grant the [[Taldan Imperial Navy]] its power.



## History

> The town was originally a lumber yard, built a century ago with the permission of the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of [[Wildwood Lodge]]. Wispil has grown considerably since then, flourishing into a proper city.


## Economy

> Wispil is vital to the continued existence of the [[Taldan Navy]], and its sole purpose as a supplier of lumber has been enough to guarantee its survival. Wood cut near Wispil is hauled overland to the [[Verduran Fork]] and floated downstream by gnomish steersman known as "boomrafters". The lumber is then tied together and floated down the [[Sellen River]] to [[Cassomir]]. All of this is done under the close supervision of the druids of the Wildwood Lodge, who ensure that the forest remains healthy and vibrant. Aside from woodwork, everything else is imported from Taldan merchants. Traders from foreign nations would be welcomed too, but few merchants are willing to risk the considerable dangers of the Verduran Forest.


## Inhabitants

> Nearly all of Wispil's inhabitants are gnomes, although a fair number of [[Halfling|halflings]], [[Elf|elves]], [[Half-elf|half-elves]], [[Fey|fey]], and a handful of [[Dwarf|dwarves]] also live there. The small number of [[Human|humans]] are typically hired by the [[Cassomir]] shipyards to oversee operations, although trappers and hunters also make stops in Wispil. These "big folk" are welcomed but are often uncomfortable, as most furniture, architecture, and utensils are unapologetically gnome-sized.


## Culture

> The gnomes in Wispil are happy with their Taldan allegiance, possibly aided by the fact that Wispil is semi-independent from Taldor, a benefit of the [[Treaty of the Wildwood]]. At present, it is considered fashionable to be connoisseur of Taldan [[Opera|opera]], and almost all of the inhabitants take turn performing at a tavern-turned-opera house in the middle of town. Official visitors are not exempt from this custom, although the gnomes are more generous in their judgement of the performance.
> The local gnome opera connoisseurs are also thought to have invented a mild euphoric [[Recreational drugs of Golarion|drug]] called [[Felwil|felwil]], whose use has since spread from Wispil throughout most of southern [[Avistan]].


## Government

> Wispil is governed by a city council but also plays a small role in Taldan politics. The settlement elects one of their citizens to become Marquess and take a seat at the senate. While most noble positions (and senatorial seats) are hereditary, Wispil serves as an exception to the rule primarily because few of Wispil's citizenry can tolerate the mundanity and drudgery of Taldan politics for very long. The current Marquess is Tanasha Starborne, who has been in her position for almost two decades.


## Local rumors

> People traveling from Wispil to [[Woodsedge]] are being preyed upon by two [[White dragon|white dragons]], Icemourne and Mirrorwing. The situation has led to numerous debates between Wispil's council, who are contemplating hiring [[Adventurer|adventurers]] to slay the beasts.
> A [[Fiendish|fiendish]] [[Quickwood|quickwood]] inhabits the woods east of Wispil. Somewhere in its territory lies a powerful *[[Lorestone|lorestone]]*, but it is unclear whether the plant is aware of its existence.
