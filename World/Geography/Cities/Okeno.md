> The harbor city of **Okeno**, located on the southern coast of [[Stonespine Island]] off the eastern shore of [[Katapesh]], is the third-largest city in Katapesh. Its bustling [[Slavery|slave]] markets host up to 1,000 slavers, buyers, and travelers at any given time.



## Geography

> Also known as the **Yellow City**, Okeno sprawls into a jigsaw of districts, once one moves away from Yellow Harbor, and no walls surround the settlement. The island has a large population of [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] who often come to the city to purchase slaves.


## History

> Okeno originally began as a convenient spot for [[Pirate|pirates]] to stop by to collect water and provisions without relying on the ports of the mainland nations. This location became an official settlement in [[3496 AR]] when [[Ilmatis Okeno|Captain Ilmatis Okeno]] declared herself lord of the port. After her death, Okeno continued to serve as a pirate port without centralised leadership, despite various attempts to unify the pirates under a single banner. This state of affairs ended in [[3721 AR]] when an organised group of [[Andoran|Andoren]] sailors grew tired of slave-trading pirates, and took it upon themselves to sink the vessels and rescue their living cargo. This conflict, and the inevitable retaliation, became known as the [[Year of Rent Sails]]. 
> During the conflict, a captain by the name of [[Lash-Handed Neguli]] blockaded Okeno harbor, sinking any [[Ship|ship]] (regardless of affiliation) who refused to ally with him. The result was the creation of a new organisation, the [[Okeno Slavers]], who held control of the city and the slave trade. 
> The captain of the Okeno Slavers often meets with the city's mayor to discuss the slave trade and identify problems. The current leader is [[Xiren Bhey|Captain Xiren Bhey]].


## Commerce

> Okeno boasts the most profitable slave markets, known as the [[Fleshfairs]]. The slaves are carried by Okeno's well-known yellow-sailed [[Slave galley|slave galleys]]. Criminals in the city are usually sent to the slave markets, hence the city's low crime rate. [[Aasimar's Mercy|Aasimars]] are particularly valued as slaves for their physical perfection meaning that they normally fetch a much higher price at auction than regular slave stock.

> A shrine of [[Gozreh]] is maintained by the siblings Niharo and Owayu. Owayu spends most of her time at the docks to provide blessings and to advise sailors of approaching storms while Niahro dispenses information to travelers heading to Katapesh and advice about cross-country travel.


## Government

> Up until 200 years ago, the Okeno Slavers were the *de facto* rulers of Okeno, but this arrangement dissolved with the appointment of an official city mayor. Okeno's current ruler, [[Morio Midasi]] enforces the few laws with ruthless consistency.
