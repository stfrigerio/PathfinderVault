> The small town of **Cypress Point**, located about 40 miles northeast of [[Kintargo]], on the point of land furthest north on the coast, is the largest settlement in [[Ravounel]] east of the [[Yolubilis River]].


## Geography

> [[Alseta's Ring|Dreamgate]] opens into a cavern, set in a seaside cliff southeast of Cypress Point.


## Notable Locations

> One of the largest buildings in town, Cypress Point Boathouse was once owned by the wealthy and selfish Najaria Arthrapple. Najaria left the boathouse to the town at the urging of Xerelilah, and the townspeople have operated and maintained the building collectively since.
> The largest commercial enterprise and the oldest building in Cypress Point is the centrally located Nine Shields Smokehouse. Many local fisherfolk sell their catches to the smokehouse's friendly owners, siblings Nenni and Noahn Karliss. Descended from [[Ulfen]] raiders who chose to stay in Cypress Point a century ago (rather than raid and leave), the brother and sister are well-liked pillars of the community. They have negotiated lucrative deals with meat purchasers in [[Kintargo]], [[Vyre]], and beyond, and they pass on a healthy portion of their profits to the commoners who supply them with [[Fish|fish]] and pork. They rarely lock their door, being happy to lose a small portion of their stock to the town's hungry or destitute from time to time.
