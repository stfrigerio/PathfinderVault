> The town of **Dabril** can be found on the [[Sellen River]] in the tumultuous nation of [[Galt]], just south of [[Kallas Lake]]. Despite being on the river, the residents here rarely work as river traders or fishermen. Instead, the people generally work as gardeners or perfumers, and the town has become known for its immense fields of roses and its manufacture of exotic perfumes.
