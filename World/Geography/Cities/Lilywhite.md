> **Lilywhite** is a small [[Pirate|pirate]] town on the western coast of [[Motaku Isle]] in the [[Shackles]] that is home to a large number of worshipers of [[Cayden Cailean]]. It is the smallest of Motaku's settlements and was founded in [[4682 AR]] by two [[Pirate|pirates]], [[Delemona Burie]] and [[Shaggard Halleck]], devotees of Cayden Cailean. Alongside the foundation of the town, the pair funded the construction of a grand stone temple to the Drunken Hero. Halleck was killed in an [[Alcohol|alcohol-fueled]] duel in [[4692 AR]]. Halleck's son, [[Little Shaggard]], and Burie are the town's [[Pirate lord|pirate lords]].
