> **Korholm** is the gateway to [[Molthune]], the seat of the so-called [[General Lords|First General Lord]], and the [[Territorial Governor|territorial seat]] of the Shrikewood province. Located at the mouth of the [[Nosam River]], Korholm is also Molthune's largest port on [[Lake Encarthan]]. Soldiers and officers bound for the war against [[Nirmathas]] drill here. The city's entrance by land is the great [[Green Gate]], which leads to a wide avenue that runs to the [[Hall of Governance]] at the city's center. Korholm is home to Molthune's most elite soldiers and its western third, the [[Arsenal District]], houses those soldiers.
