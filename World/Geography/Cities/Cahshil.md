> **Cahshil** is a hamlet built upon a particularly deep wetland in southern [[Sargava]] by a community of [[Song'o|Songo]] [[Halfling|halflings]] originally from the [[Laughing Jungle]] who fled the escalating warfare between the [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] and [[Boggard|boggards]]. These halflings are subsistence hunters and rarely trust or interact with outsiders, giving rise to the erroneous rumours that they command [[Juju|terrible spirits]] and eat [[Human|human]] flesh. The [[Tojanida|tojanida]] Guughwa is an occasional ally and frequent bully of Cahshil's residents, and often demands hospitality and attention from them.
