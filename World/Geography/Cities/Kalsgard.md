> The city of **Kalsgard** sits on the southern banks of the [[Rimeflow River]] in the northern reaches of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] known as the [[Thanelands]]. It is the biggest city in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings and as such is the most cosmopolitan city for several hundred miles, housing communities of [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[Gnome|gnomes]], [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisians]] and people from even further afield.



## Government

 
 [[Thira Ash-Eyes|King Thira Ash-Eyes]], ruler of the [[Thanelands]] and Kalsgard.

He was succeeded by his daughter [[Thira Ash-Eyes]], who claimed his throne in the traditional manner: by slaying a [[Linnorm|linnorm]].


## Geography

> Kalsgard is divided into nine districts, called city quarters:

> - [[Amber Quarter]]

> - [[Fire Quarter]]
> - [[Horn Quarter]]
> - [[Ice Quarter]]
> - [[Ivory Quarter]]
> - [[Jade Quarter]]
