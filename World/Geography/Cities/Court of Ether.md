> The **Court of Ether** is an inverted city built among and in the stalactites which form the roof of the [[Endless Gulf]], one of the most well-known locations of [[Nar-Voth]]. Despite its prominent location, the Court of Ether is rarely frequented by the denizens of the [[Darklands]], as it is home to [[Frilogarma|Queen Frilogarma]] and her twisted [[Dark fey|dark fey]] followers. It is located beneath the [[Candlestone Caverns]] of northern [[Andoran]].


## Description

> The upside-down city is built among the countless stalactites and ledges that cover the roof of the Endless Gulf connected by bridges. Phosphorescent [[Fungi|fungi]] grow to extraordinary sizes in large circles among the structures, giving the city an eerie glow that can be seen for miles. The Endless Gulf itself is not an infinitely deep pit, although it might as well be: it stretches all the way through the layer of [[Sekamina]] into the [[Orv|Orvian]] Vault called the [[Midnight Mountains]].


## Inhabitants

> The primary inhabitants of the Court of Ether are the dark fey who have gathered under the rule of Queen Frilogarma, primarily [[Gremlin|gremlins]], [[Redcap|redcaps]], and corrupted [[Pixie|pixies]]. These have bred [[Stirge|stirges]] to serve as aerial mounts, and are allied with a colony of [[Gryph|gryphs]]. The Court is also home to native [[Xorn|xorn]] and other [[Elemental|elemental]] creatures.
> The [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] and their elemental allies keep a careful watch on the city, but dare not approach too closely for fear of the Queen's [[Magic|magical]] powers. In fact, one of the reasons the svirfneblin migrated to [[Golarion]] from the [[First World]] was to oppose the [[Evil|evil]] schemes of the Queen and her followers.
