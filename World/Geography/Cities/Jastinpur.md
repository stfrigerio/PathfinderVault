Despite the Narhari Desert being the harshest, most desolate of all of the regions of the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]] Jastinpur has still managed to become a beautiful, thriving metropolis. Jastinpur is surrounded by four concentric walls that still bear the scars of many sieges. Within the walls, the city is full of beautiful [[Music|music]] and [[Art|art]], bustling bazaars, and beautiful palaces.
