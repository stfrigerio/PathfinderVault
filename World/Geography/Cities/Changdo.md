> **Changdo, the Imperial City,** is the capital of [[Po Li]], and was the original capital of [[Lung Wa]], the empire that dominated [[Tian Xia]] until the death of [[Aroden]].



## Geography

> The Imperial City is in western Po Li, at the junction of a lake and river that feed the [[Sea of Ghosts]] southern tip.
> Changdo is divided into three major zones: the inner forbidden zone home to the [[Oracular Council]] and their families and servants; its edges filled with mansions, lords, and clerks; and the outer city of merchants and commoners.


## Government

> The Oracular Council maintains Po Li's worship of the [[Eternal Emperor]] and protects the *[[Five Dragon Throne]]* that awaits the emperor's reincarnation in the forbidden city.


## History

> Construction on the massive [[Eternal Emperor statue|statue of the Eternal Emperor]] that dominates Changdo's skyline began in [[4398 AR]], 208 years before the collapse of imperial Lung Wa.
