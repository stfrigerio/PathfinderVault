## Geography

> Anuli wraps around the Oyster Sound to its east, and the large round Crater Lake and the Ladder that feeds it both dominate its western side. The Magebe Mountains stand over the city.


## History

> Historically, Anuli has been responsible for protecting Holomog's northern border against threats such as incursions from the armies of the [[Shory]] and the undead of Geb, leading to its unusually aggressive and military character among the Holoma cities.
> In [[4606 AR]], Anuli was rocked by a powerful explosion known as the Paroxsys, which annihilated a large part of the northern city and killed its current queen and all of her successors. The people of Anuli have since recovered from the disaster, with aid from the rest of their nation, and elected the druid Botoji to be their new queen. Today, the chief physical mark of the Paroxsys is the crater itself, which has since filled with water to become a large lake. The true cause of the explosion is not known, but many locals suspect Geb. This has the potential to lead to war.


## Trade

> The Apex Trading House hosts many of the city's guilds of tradesman. This congregation also leads to it being a hub for exports. Anuli has been getting a larger reputation for its products, including; local minerals, seafood, and handcrafted items. Many of these items honor the [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lords]]. Local [[Spice|spices]] such as paprika are also popular.


## Cuisine

> Anulites like their food to have heat. Many of the seafood and vegetable dishes include the distinctive taste of [[Anulite paprika]].
