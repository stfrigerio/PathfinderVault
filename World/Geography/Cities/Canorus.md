## History

> Along with its sister colony of [[Anchor's End|Anchors End]], Canorus provided [[Gold|gold]] and [[Slaves|slaves]] to the empire, and had little contact with the [[Ulfen]] settlement of [[Valenhall]] far to the northeast.
> However, it was overrun by [[Dark folk|dark folk]] and a [[Telgrodradt|telgrodradt]] that invaded the colony, which was situated above their subterranean tunnels. A band of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] from outside the colony came to Canorus, fought the swarming [[Zombie|zombies]] infesting it, and investigated the tunnels. However, only one survived, and only long enough to tell of the telgrodradt before herself turning [[Undead|undead]].
> The few surviving villagers moved south to Canorus's sister colony of [[Anchor's End|Anchors End]].
