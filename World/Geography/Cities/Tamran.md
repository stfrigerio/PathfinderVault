> The city of **Tamran**, capital of [[Nirmathas]], is a ramshackle city, especially for a nation's capital. It is built on piers and pilings over the marshlands at the mouth of the [[Marideth River]], where it meets the banks of [[Lake Encarthan]]. The city is connected by a web of bridges, ramps, and causeways, and a flotilla of barges and skiffs, and all of the buildings are made from wood. Due to the fact Tamran is still standing after its violent history, it is seen as a symbol of Nirmathas's tenacity and resourcefulness. Considering Nirmathas is a country at war, Tamran seems to lack any sort of defences, including a city wallâ€”but as history has shown, this is in fact its best defence.



## History


### First Offense

> Tamran did at one point have a city wall surrounding it, but in [[4646 AR]]â€”two years before the formal start of the [[Freedom War]] with neighbouring [[Molthune]]â€”Molthuni forces seized the city in a battle later known as the **First Offense**. Northern rebels, while not yet fully organized, attempted to reclaim the city months later.
> It became clear that such a static defence played into Molthune's traditional style of warfare and even hindered counter-attacks. Instead, the Nirmathi tore down their old city wall, their soldiers dissipating into the surrounding countryside upon hearing word of an attack from [[Molthune]], and the citizens of Tamran would then simply surrender. The [[Nirmathas]] soldiers would then sneak back into the city, aided by the river and lack of city walls, to wreak havoc on the occupying forces using guerrilla tactics.
> Since the conflicts began, Tamran has been occupied five times, each time proving too costly to hold for long. At the end of their last occupation, Molthuni forces grew so frustrated that they burned the city to the ground, only to have it be completely rebuilt within a year.


### Worship of Razmir

> Since [[4709 AR]], the worship of [[Razmir]] has been outlawed by decree of Forest Marshal [[Weslen Gavirk]], since it was proven that the clergy were bullying and extorting local businesses in town.
