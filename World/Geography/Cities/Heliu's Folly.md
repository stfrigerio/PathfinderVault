> **Heliu's Folly** was one of the westernmost fortresses of the defensive line known as the [[Sunwall]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. 



## History

> A mercurial and ambitious [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] captain named Waren Heliu used the keep as his personal [[Magic|magical]] [[Laboratory|laboratory]]. Heliu was a [[Summoner|summoner]] who specialized in fire magic and [[Magic/Conjuration|summoning]], and summoned and bound a massive [[Thoqqua|thoqqua]], an intelligent worm-like creature from the [[Plane of Fire]]. He kept it hidden in a subbasement of the keep but overestimated his ability to control the creature. The thoqqua escaped its wards and began a fire that consumed the keep in flames. Heliu was discharged from the Lastwall military and the ruined keep became known as Heliu's Folly.


### Orc usage

> Since the fall of the Sunwall in [[4237 AR]], several [[Orc|orc]] tribes have occupied the keep, and it is currently the base of operations of the [[Broken Spine tribe]].


### Recent history

> The thoqqua Heliu summoned returned to the subbasement under the keep a few years ago. It is currently in a dormant, reproductive state.
