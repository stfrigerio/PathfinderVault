> **Kelmarane** is a ruined [[Battle market|battle market]] village in northwestern [[Katapesh]]. The village was one of several in the [[Uwaga Highlands]] of the [[Brazen Peaks]] situated around the battle market. In [[4689 AR]] the [[Pactmasters]] abandoned it to ruin. By [[4707 AR]] the Kulldis tribe of [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] had claimed Kelmarane as its own. The village has since become a haven of gnoll [[Slavery|slavers]], [[Human|human]] bandits, and disreputable brigands from the northlands.
> Aside from the ancient battle market and the ruined church of [[Sarenrae]], most of the structures in Kelmarane are abandoned ruins. Most lack roofs or sturdy walls, but others are solid enough to provide temporary shelter.
> The [[Pactmasters]] hired [[Almah Roveshki]] to reclaim the village.
