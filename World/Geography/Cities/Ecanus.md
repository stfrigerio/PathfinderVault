> **Ecanus** is a fortress-city in southern [[Nex]] that was established during the centuries-long war with neighbouring [[Geb's Rest]]. It is a sprawling city that serves as the hub of Nex's arcane-powered military. Here the battle mages that make up the backbone of the army are trained in a mixture of potent evocation and battle tactics. The city is also famous for its [[Fleshforge|fleshforges]]: building-sized artefacts created by the archmage [[Nex (person)|Nex]] himself that provide the terrifying war beasts which support the battle mages. The fleshforges are responsible for many of the nightmarish creatures which roam the wastelands of Nex, the [[Barrier Wall]] mountains, the [[Mana Wastes]], and even the [[Mwangi Expanse]].
> The city is the terminus of a trade route that winds its way south through the Mana Wastes, ending at the Gebbite town of [[Graydirge]].
