> The city of **Hoarwood** lies in the cold, northern nation of [[Irrisen]]. Situated at the heart of the [[Hoarwood Forest]], the entire city is carved from the trunk of a petrified tree of incredible size. Its only other claim to fame is the wild debauchery of the constant parties thrown by its ruler, [[Anelisha Elvanna]], and her brother and lover [[Ghrathis Elvanna|Ghrathis]].
