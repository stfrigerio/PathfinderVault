> **Omash** is a fortress-city in northern [[Qadira]] near the border of [[Taldor]] that lies on the eastern end of the Satrapy's patrols. The city contains a dozen schools of war from which the satrap personally chooses warriors for special duties. Each of them specializes in a different tactic or troop type: there are schools for [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]] cavalry, [[Camel|camel]] cavalry, carpet cavalry, archery, [[Polearm|polearms]], [[Siege engine|siege warfare]], and castle-storming. Some of the Peerless, the personal advisors to the satrap, have come from these schools.
