> **Sverspume** is one of the most well-known settlements in the [[Darklands]], as it hosts the largest open [[Slave|slave]] market found below [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]].


## Geography

> Located far below the nation of [[Nidal]] in the Darklands realm of [[Sekamina]], Sverspume occupies a large central cavern surrounded in a ring by numerous smaller caves. These exterior caverns are patrolled by [[Caligni creeper|caligni creepers]].


## Inhabitants

> The primary occupants of Sverspume are [[Caligni|caligni]] who control the traffic and sale of slaves within the city. Their leader, a [[Caligni stalker|caligni stalker]] by the name of [[August Caller]], officiates at the most important auctions. Other Darklands and surface races are common here as well, especially [[Duergar|duergar]], who bring in the majority of [[Darklands slang|darksider]] slaves for trade. The caligni make sure that disagreements between the varying races do not escalate into open conflict, and have the power to ban offending races for an entire year or more from the slave markets. Currently [[Elf|surface elves]], [[Mongrelmen|mongrelmen]], and [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] are barred and can be attacked on site if found trespassing.
