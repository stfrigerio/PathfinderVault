> **Olfden** is a large [[Andoren]] town located in the nation's [[Darkmoon Vale]] region, halfway between [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] and [[Oregent]], and only a few miles away from [[Adamas]], headquarters of the [[Diamond Regiment]].


## History

> Olfden was founded in [[4128 AR]] by [[Barenddo Novotnian]], nephew of the famous [[Karas Novotnian]] who pacified Darkmoon Vale.
> The town was attacked by a large band of [[Werewolf|werewolves]] in an event known as the Night of Silver Blood in [[4706 AR]]. The beasts were eventually defeated thanks to the sacrifice of [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] [[Luna Aldred]]. A plaque and statue commemorating her courage was commissioned by the town


## Inhabitants

> Perched on a low cliff along the [[Elberwick Rise]], Olfden's men-at-arms ensure the safe passage of [[Darkwood|darkwood]]-laden convoys and fight to suppress the area's [[Werewolf|werewolves]]. The town is supported by the Diamond Regiment and the elusive Fangwatch.
> Resurrected after being slain by werewolves, Luna Aldred remained in Olfden and established the [[Silver Moon Sanctuary]] which serves as both Pathfinder Lodge and animal sanctuary.
