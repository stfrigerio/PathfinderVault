> The town of **Bug Harbor** is a gathering of huts perched on stilts at the edge of swamp [[Evergrowth]]. It got its name from the swarms of dragonflies, water striders, and other insects that buzz over the swamp. The town supplies herbs and plants for [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemists]], [[Herbalist|herbalists]], [[Wizard|wizards]], and [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] who travel here in search of rare components. The unofficial mayor of Bug Harbor is the [[Half-elf|half-elf]] Bastin Irriden.
