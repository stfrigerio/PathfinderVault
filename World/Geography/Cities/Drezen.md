> Founded as a city-fortress during the hubris of the [[Mendevian Crusades|First Mendevian Crusade]], **Drezen** was overtaken by the [[Demon|demonic]] hordes of the [[Worldwound]]. For years, it stood as a demonic monument to the foolish naivety of those early crusaders, until it was freed with the rest of the Worldwound by members of the [[Fifth Mendevian Crusade]] in [[4718 AR]].


## Worldwound

> The crusader city of Drezen was overwhelmed in [[4638 AR]]; a wave of raw [[Chaos|chaos]] washed over the city turning most of its citizens into hideous beast-men creatures who turned on each other in a wave of [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] fury. After the slaughter finally stopped, the corpses were taken from the city to the ice cliffs that mark the [[Crown of the World]]. From these corpses arose the foul [[Wraith|winter wraiths]] who are capable of freezing a man dead with but a touch.
> [[Argil|Saint Argil]], also known as the Pauper Sorcerer, was martyred as he defended the fleeing people against the demonic armies.
> The city's once proud crusader shrines dedicated to [[Iomedae]], [[Sarenrae]], and the other crusader deities were perverted into mockeries of their former use and dedicated to foul [[Demon lord|demon lords]]. The city was home to thousands of demons, led by one of the most ruthless demonic generals of the Worldwound, the bloodthirsty [[Marilith|marilith]] commander [[Zuhra Aponavicius]].
