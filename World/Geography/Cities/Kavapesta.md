*For another meaning of "Kavapesta", please see [[Mother Kavapesta]].*
> **Kavapesta** is the population center for the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Amaans]], located on the shores of [[Lake Kavapesta]].
> The largest city in Amaans and a holy city for [[Pharasma|Pharasmins]], Kavapesta is a somber place possessed by a dour variety of religious fanaticism. The city takes its name from [[Mother Kavapesta]], a Pharasmin missionary and teacher whose sermons on perseverance and suffering laid the foundations for the [[Philosophy|philosophies]] today known as the [[Pharasmin Penitence]]. After the priestess's death, her followers began the construction of Cryptgate Cathedral, which through centuries of renovations and expansions would become the largest church and monastery of [[Pharasma]] in Ustalav. The effort of constructing this monument and the tombs beneath brought droves of pilgrims to the banks of [[Lake Kavapesta|Lake Divirmis]], which the faithful eventually renamed Lake Kavapesta. With the cathedral's completion, the assembled congregation lingered on, hoping to create a community based on the tenets of their faith. This community grew slowly, finally becoming the city known today.
> Yet a city needs more than faith to survive, a fact the people of Kavapesta stubbornly defy. The foothills around the city are poorly suited to farming and the lake is tainted by [[Poison|poisonous]] minerals from the [[Hungry Mountains]]. A few mines in the surrounding hills scrape tin and coal out of the earth, though one has to wonder if the [[Coin|coin]] won from these efforts is worth the lives lost to cave-ins, choking maladies, and more mysterious disappearances. But worst of all are the [[Disease|plagues]], the rampant sicknesses that seem to boil up from Lake Kavapesta once a generation and burn through the city like a field fire. Scourges like the Whithers, Tol's Voice, and, most fearfully, the [[Diseases of GolarionBleak Breath|Bleak Breath]] have killed thousands in their beds, with lesser scares and re-emergences occurring every few years. But the people claim that their city is blessedâ€”not [[Curse|cursed]] like so many visitors sayâ€”insisting that each new calamity is a test from Pharasma and an opportunity for the citizens to experience ever greater trials, assuring greater rewards after death.
