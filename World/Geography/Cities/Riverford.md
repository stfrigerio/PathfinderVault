> **Riverford** is a small [[Andoren]] agricultural community situated just over 200 miles upriver from the capital of [[Almas]]. It grew up around the [[Old Bridge Riverford|Old Bridge]], a river crossing of the [[Andoshen River|Andoshen]], and has existed in one form or another for 3,000 years. Known for its bountiful harvests and exceptional beef [[Cattle|cattle]], Riverford has also been the site of at least 10 major battles over the centuries due to it being one of the few places an army can cross the Andoshen River. Farmers still uncover [[Archaeology|archaeological treasures]] from these wars, generally selling them off as quickly as possible for fear that their land will be confiscated and turned into an archaeological site.


## Geography

> The town consists of a single cobbled street set back from the river, along with several dirt roads that connect to private homes, a number of inns, and old warehouses. The [[Old Bridge Tower]], a low fortification, overlooks Riverford from a nearby hill and houses the armory for the town's militia. The [[Eagle Knights]] keep an officer and a small contingent of soldiers live here to train the militia. The surrounding countryside is dotted with graves, cairns, and barrows that bear witness to the town's violent past.
