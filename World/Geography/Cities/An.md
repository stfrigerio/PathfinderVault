> **An** is the first of [[Sothis]]' trio of southern sister cities, along with [[Tephu]] and [[Wati]]. It was founded in [[-107 AR]] by [[Hirkoshek I|Pharaoh Hirkoshek I]] as a worker city housing the laborers and artisans working to construct his pyramid.
> The **City of Triangles** is so-called because of the similar shapes of distant [[Mount Na-Ken]] and the surrounding peaks, as well as the pyramids visible on the southern horizon.  Aside from the pyramid of Hirkoshek I, the region also holds the pyramids of [[Hirkoshek II]], Zahur I, and [[Kamaria the Brazen]]. Kamaria's [[Pyramid of Kamaria|pyramid]], thought plundered long ago, continues to attract followers of the cult of [[Rovagug]], and some whisper that there may be unopened levels beneath those already explored.
