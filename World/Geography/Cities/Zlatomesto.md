> **Zlatomesto** is a small town in [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of [[Wintercrux]]. It is located at the southern part of the province and serves as the shipping center for the [[Ice diamonds|ice diamonds]] mined at [[Hope Lost]] and the products of the mines and stone quarries of [[Skala Foothills]]. [[Sabina Kseniya|Baroness Sabina Kseniya]] and her five sullen offspring rule the town with iron efficiency. Zlatomesto's peasants work hard day and night under the lash like slaves, loading the caravans' wagons and sledges.
> The [[Tin King Alley Tavern]] is the place that the masters of the work gangs prefer. The tavern is famous for the [[Alcoholic beverages|potato vodka]] it serves. The owner of the tavern, [[Liisu Nyetesky]] is a secret agent of the underground movement, called the [[Heralds of Summer's Return|Heralds of Summers Return]]. The information she gathers from the drunken patrons concerning the schedule of the most important shipments headed east is valuable for the organization in order to set up ambushes.
