> **Celephais** is a magnificent, populous city of smooth marble walls and impressive brass gates, located in the valley of Ooth-Nargai in the [[Dreamlands]]. Beyond the city stands snow-covered Mount Aran. For visitors to Celephais, [[Time|time]] seems to stand still, although visitors and natives alike experience the passage of time normally. Legend has it that it was dreamt into existence by a powerful dreamer from a distant [[World/Geography/Planes & Planets/Earth|world]].
