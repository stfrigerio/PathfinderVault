> **Okormirr** is a now largely abandoned settlement in the northwestern corner of [[Iobaria]]. The first [[Human|human]] settlement in [[Iobaria]], it was founded in [[752 AR]] when 20 survivors of an [[Ulfen]] expedition set up a longhouse to survive the winter. A settlement soon grew up around the the longhouse, becoming Okormirr: the first of nine Ulfen settlements of [[Njalgard]]. Resettled many times over the centuries, Okormirr retains much of its original Ulfen character, with log lodges, dragon poles, and wooden palisades. 
> Okormirr sits on the northeastern shore of the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]], south of the [[Ardshrod River]]. Now inhabited mostly by [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] and their families, the city resents [[Tzakiv Korya|Prince Tzakiv Korya]] of [[Orlov|Orlovs]] many promises to restore his city and kingdom to greatness. Okormirr is ruled by the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|Druid-King]] [[Aalgin]], who requires all who live in Okormirr to swear allegiance to his druid circle and their god, [[Perbov]].
