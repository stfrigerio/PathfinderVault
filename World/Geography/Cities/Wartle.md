> Though it is not a new settlement, the town of **Wartle** remains something of a frontier trading post, primarily populated by swampers and trappers who do not mind the inhospitable environment amidst the [[Mushfens]]. The buildings of the town rise out of the murky swamp water on stilts, connected by wooden boardwalks.  Major exports of the town are peat, fungus, and furs, mostly sent down the [[Yondabakari River]] to [[Magnimar]]. The town sports a few successful brothels and a precariously tilted tavern called the [[Lean-To]], which serves a local liquor called [[Alcoholic beverages|Bog Grog]].
