> The town of **Folarth** is located in southern [[Nirmathas]] near the [[Deepcut River]].


## History

> Originally settled by [[Dwarf|dwarves]] as a outpost for [[Kraggodan]] soldiers joining the [[Shining Crusade]], this town was originally named **Folgrit's Hearth** after the dwarven [[Deity|goddess]], [[Folgrit]].  It evolved into a hospice for veterans of the crusade. The natural hot springs that the town contained became renowned for their curative qualities. However, Folarth has come upon hard times, and has shed most of its population and can no longer maintain the baths that made it famous.


## Current situation

> As the Nesmian Plains are close to the border of [[Molthune]], Folarth faces a depopulation crisis. The ornate [[Gold|golden]] structures that the dwarves originally built have crumbled. Folarth still sees a few injured veterans seeking the power of the hot springs. It also sells its mineral water to [[Tamran]].
