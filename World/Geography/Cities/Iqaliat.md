> **Iqaliat** is a small village of [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] [[Human|humans]] in the [[Crown of the World]], built into the side of Alasek Ridge on the southern boundary of the [[High Ice]] some miles west of the [[Path of Aganhei]]. It is constructed beneath the cliff's overhanging ridge. Most of the town is made up of small stone and clay brick buildings and subsists on water from an underground stream.
> Iqaliat is protected by its location beneath the cliffs. Travelers can only enter the village through a gatehouse above several earthen ramps. Other sites in the village include low towers inhabited by the village's chieftain Nalvanaq and its shaman Tunuak, Hearthmistress Sonavut's small house, a [[Goat|goat]] pen, a kennel for the village's [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|dogs]], and a subterranean cistern. A small tunnel leads up to the cliff top, where one can find several *inukshuks*, altars to the Erutaki wind spirits.
> The [[White dragon|white dragon]] Vegsundvaag keeps her lair not far from Iqaliat.
