> The border town of **Yensa** lies on the [[Iceflow River]], separating the [[Irrisen]] province of [[Bleakmarch]] from the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Hagreach]]. Its ruler, [[Marcelyna|Countess Marcelyna]], does her best to encourage trade between the two nations, even going so far as to bar entrance to the town to mercenary companies and other ruffians intent on conducting cross-border raids.
> Countess carefully cultivates a friendly image is order to foster commerce but the Yensa's inhabitants know their mistress' cruel nature. None dare to reveal the truth to visitors who hear nothing but praise for the countess from her secretly brutalized subjects. The blacksmith Vanak Usztony lost his wife from Marcelyna's cruelty and he still doesn't speak a word of complain in order to protect his four children.
