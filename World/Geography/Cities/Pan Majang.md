> **Pan Majang** is a constantly transforming metropolis located in the [[Clicking Caverns]] in [[Sekamina]], beneath the border between [[Xa Hoi]] and [[Nagajor]], near the caldera of [[Mount Kumijinja]]. It is inhabited by [[Clockwork|clockworks]] [[Haunted construct|haunted]] by the [[Soul|souls]] of their extinct, sadistic, flesh-eating builders, who often emerge from Pan Majang to raid both Nagajor and Xa Hoi. Pan Majang is ruled by a shadowy council of horrible half-[[Undead|undead]], half-clockwork creatures.
