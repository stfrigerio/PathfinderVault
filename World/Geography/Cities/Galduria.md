> **Galduria** is a town in central [[Varisia]], located on the western shore of [[Ember Lake]].  Generally thought of as a dependent of the city-state of [[Magnimar]], most of the town's wealth is generated by the trade of grain and lumber across the lake and along the [[Lampblack River]].  Its true claim to fame is its arcane college, the [[Twilight Academy]], the founding of which in [[4629 AR]] by Galdurin Barmier was the establishment of the town. The Twilight Academy rivals the larger colleges in Varisia, the [[Stone of the Seers]] in Magnimar, and [[Korvosa|Korvosas]] [[Acadamae]]. The college was founded specifically to avoid the political pressure and intrigues of those two cities.  The Twilight Academy has a reputation for undertaking many experimental and unconventional practices.  Nevertheless, locals turn the other way regarding its strange ways in exchange for the money that the college is able to provide for various civic projects.


## Organizations

> The [[Harrowed Society]] uses the Twilight Academy as a sort of a "front", concentrating on the mysteries held in [[Harrow Deck|harrow cards]].
