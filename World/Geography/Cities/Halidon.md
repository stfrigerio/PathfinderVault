> **Halidon** is a small logging community on the edge of the northern [[Backar Forest]] in [[Molthune]]. Lying roughly halfway between the capital of [[Canorate]] and [[Braganza]], the town is a frequent stop for travelers and has, therefore, a large number of inns with respect to its resident population.
