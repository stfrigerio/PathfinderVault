> The **Gunworks** of [[Alkenstar]] was built in [[4620 AR]] and has been the primary source of [[Firearms|firearms]] in the [[Alkenstar|Grand Duchy]] and the rest of [[Golarion]] ever since.


## Appearance

 
 The [[Great Maw of Rovagug]] defends the Gunworks.
> The Gunworks resembles a small castle, and is defended by the mighty bombard known as the [[Great Maw of Rovagug]]. The main perceived threat are the forces of the [[Gorilla King]], which successfully raided the Gunworks in [[4690 AR]]. However, the most frequent attacks are by [[Giant|giants]] from the [[Western Ravage]]â€”some of these raids actually resulted in firearms being stolen.


## Firearms manufacture

> Manufacturing only one small-arms [[Weapon|weapon]] a day and five siege weapons a year, one would think this massive facility highly inefficient considering its size and twelve-hour workdays. In fact, the Gunworks is capable of a much higher rate of production but maintains a slow schedule to keep the market price of the weapons artificially high by limiting supply. This conservative approach also helps ensure the small nation's safety, as it is estimated that Alkenstar keeps over ninety percent of the weapons they manufacture, making it one of the most heavily defended kingdoms in the [[Inner Sea region]]. The slow production rate also allows a great deal of time to be spent on improving the [[Science|science]] of firearm production.
