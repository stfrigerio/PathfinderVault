> The town of **Ollo** is one of the largest settlements in the [[Shackles]]. It is ruled by the cruel [[Pirate|pirate]] [[Avimar Sorrinash]], one of the members of the [[Pirate Council]].
> Ollo is on [[Shark Island]], and is plagued by raids from the [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] who live in the sea near the island. These raids are carried out with Sorrinash's permission, and the people of Ollo live in daily fear of a sahuagin attack.
