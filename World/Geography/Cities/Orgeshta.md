> The city of **Orgeshta**, in the vault of [[Orv]] known as the [[Land of Black Blood]], is named after the mysterious [[Deity|deity]] [[Orgesh]]. The city is home to numerous ancient icons of Orgesh.


## Geography

> Also known as the **City of Piled Stones**, it consists of a number of circular towers shaped like beehives. They all have entrances at the top, although some also have ground floor entrances as well. The city has stood for countless centuries, a testament to the skills of its unknown builders. Some believe they were a corrupt race of [[Dwarf|dwarves]].


## Inhabitants

> The city has few settled inhabitants, but [[Charda|charda]] visitors are common. They camp in flooded tower basements, and leave offerings of food at the many icons of Orgesh which can be found here. Travellers to Orv often find the city a comparatively safe place to stop, although they have to content with [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bats]], [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Rat|rats]], and [[Cloaker|cloakers]]. As a result, the city has graffiti in a dozen languages.
