> **Saraby** is a small town on the [[Thundering River]] in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of [[Wintercrux]]. It is a bustling peasant town which accepts a number of [[Varisian]] merchants that have the courage to travel the few treacherous passes across the [[Kodar Mountains]] into Irrisen. The brave merchants mainly deliver grain and foodstuff and are richly rewarded. Saraby is ruled by [[Zoja|Baroness Zoja]] who carefully accounts the volumes of trading goods moving through her town. Much of the precious cargo moves on to [[Dalun]] to the west and eventually is delivered to the militant settlements and camps of the [[Verge]]. The rest, however, is sent east along a route known as the [[Saraby Trail]].
> The Saraby Trail to the east follows no visible roads. It follows the Thundering River until reaching the Kodar Mountains and then heads north towards [[Hope Lost]]. From Hope Lost some experienced groups head directly east to [[Sosulka]] fighting the beasts of the tundra and the fearful white-furred [[Peryton|perytons]] that prowl the skies but most of the groups take one of the well traveled roads that meander through the [[Skala Foothills]] to [[Zlatomesto]]. There they join a heavily guarded caravan of ore and travel to [[Veshtak]]. [[Bendiks Poljarny]] and [[Velna Elishky]] are veterans of the Saraby Trail.
