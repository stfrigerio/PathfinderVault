> **Hell Harbor** is the largest settlement on the island of [[Devil's Arches|Devils Arches]], in the [[Shackles]]. It is ruled by the pirate lord [[Arronax Endymion]], a member of the [[Pirate Council]]. Endymion is a fan of traditional [[Chelish opera]], and the town boasts the Shackles' only [[Opera|opera]] house, the [[Three-Horned Hall]]. It is not clear whether the other residents share his passion for the [[Art|arts]], but those seeking the pirate lord's favour make a point of sitting through performances.
> The city takes its name from the numerous [[Imp|imps]] which live in the area. Endymion is a mutineer from the [[Chelish Navy]], and is worried that some of the imps may be [[Cheliax|Chelish]] spies. As a result, he has recently started trying to eradicate them. Ethnic [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelaxians]] (apart from members of Endymion's own squadron, the [[Devils' Own|Devils Own]]) are not welcome in the town, for the same reason. Any who arouse Endymion's suspicions are thrown into the city's prison, the [[Wretched Furnace]].
> [[Pirate|Pirates]] established the port town of Hell Harbor in the early years of the Shackles, as the natural harbor is deep and easy to defend. They used limestone from ancient quarries and [[Ghol-Gan]] ruins to build tall watchtowers flanking its narrow harbor entrance. The [[Faded Seahorse]] is a tavern renowned for its [[Cyclops|cyclops]] bouncer [[Eriboe]].
