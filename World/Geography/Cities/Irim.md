> **Irim** is a city of [[Aquatic elf|aquatic elves]] hidden in the continental margin off the coast of [[Ravounel]].



## Geography

> Irim's dwellings, built into the continental slope, are concealed by kelp forests and connect to a cave system that has been inhabited since before the [[Elf|elves]] returned from [[Sovyrian]].


## Government

> Irim is ruled by the Riftia, a group of scholars who inhabit the deepest caves, breathe from hydrothermal vents, and [[Magic/Divination|read portents]] in the movement of tube worms.


## History

> For most of its history, Irim has been hidden from surface dwellers, only communicating with their [[Mordant Spire elves|cousins]] in the [[Mordant Spire]]. Recently, the Riftia has made contact with the government of Ravounel, offering to protect their ports from [[Pirate|pirates]] in exchange for their aid in locating an [[Artifact|artifact]] known as the *Lornoc Catalyst*, something that they must not reveal to surface elves.


## People

> Irim's inhabitants live pastoral lives, tending isopod herds or sea anemone farms.
