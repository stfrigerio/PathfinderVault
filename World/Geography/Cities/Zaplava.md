> **Zaplava** is a little village on [[Rimeflow River]] just before reaching [[Glacier Lake]] in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of [[Wintercrux]]. Few travelers stop at the village, inhabited by as many as seven intermarried families. The miserable superstitious peasants live in fear of the dreaded [[Frozen Fog]] to the east. The fog's icy tendrils and the strange horrors that sometimes wander close to the village make the frightened peasants hide in their stone hovels. [[Arko Arkosson]] is the mayor of Zaplava.
> Todora Navanya, a renowned adventurer in [[Avistan]], comes from this tiny village.
