> **Caldamin** is a small, rural town in northernmost [[Andoran]], nestled between the [[Five Kings Mountains]] to the west, the [[Verduran Forest]] to the east, and the [[Dragonfly River]] to the south. This otherwise unremarkable settlement has become somewhat of a tourist attraction of late, due to the presence of two extraordinary creatures who make their home nearby: a [[Red reaver|red reaver]] named Auger and a gray render called Shepherd Graygulp. These two foes occasionally battle each other, and their fights are of such ferocity that people come from far afield to witness the clashes.
