> The settlement of **Blisterwell** was once an extensive [[Dwarf|dwarven]] quarry and strip mine that fell under [[Orc|orc]] control with the coming of the warlord [[Belkzen person|Belkzen]] in [[-4213 AR]]. It has stayed in orc hands ever since, but is now a hotly contested urban battleground between two tribes: the [[Haskodar tribe|Haskodars]] and the [[One Eye tribe|One Eyes]].



## Geography

> Blisterwell is located in the central region of the [[Hold of Belkzen]], called the [[Blood Plains]], south-east of the [[Kodar Mountains]] and to the west of the [[Flood Road]]. The ancient battlefields of the [[Battle of Screaming Tree]] and the [[Battle of the Shadefields]] can be found nearby as evidence of the regions turbulent history.
> The settlement itself is built into a massive, ancient pit mine, the shape of an inverted cone. A vast network of dwellings have been carved into the walls of its deep shafts and trenches.


## Inhabitants

> Blisterwell is the Hold of Belkzen's third most populous settlement, favoured by the orcs for its dank pits and caverns. At night the fires of its forges reflect off the stagnant lake that has collected in its bottom.


## Government

> The [[Haskodar tribe|Haskodar]] and [[One Eye tribe|One Eye tribes]] are the current residents of Blisterwell, and these tribes maintain an uneasy alliance in governing the settlement.
