> **Chastel** is the largest town in the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Lozeri]], lying on that county's southern border. The town is located close to the southern edge of the [[Shudderwood]] just north of the meeting point of the [[Vhatsuntide River]] with its tributary, the [[Vistear River]]. Chastel has the air of a frontier settlement despite its size, possibly due to the roughness exhibited by the locals. The town, though, does have a large market, lumber mills, and stockyards but lacks any protective walls, and as such, it is often the target of predators, the most notorious being the [[Rats of Karneik]]. In [[4701 AR]], Chastel was invaded by the murderous [[Winter wolf|winter wolf]] known as the [[Devil in Gray]]; in a single night, he killed nearly twenty people before disappearing back into the wilds of Lozeri.
