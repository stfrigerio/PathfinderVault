> **Shethalliahaya** is the home city of the [[Shae|shaes]] on the [[Shadow Plane]], built from black shadowstone and capped in white. Visitors are rarely allowed into the city; the rare few that are speak of [[Arcane magic|arcane]] secrets unknown outside the city, or the [[Occult ritual|occult rituals]] used by the shaes to shed their corporeal forms. According to the followers of [[Sivanah]], the city is also home to one of her sacred temples. As evidence of this, Sivanah's followers point to the similarities between Sivanah's veils and the shaes' masks; as well as the Severed Mask, one of her [[Divine servitor|divine servitors]] who is a mighty shae.
