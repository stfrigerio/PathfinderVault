> **Ruwido** is a hovel-village secreted away in the notorious [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Virlych]] where misbegotten, cast out, mad and deformed souls can find a home, hide their faces from the world and find a modicum of peace and acceptance. The village is found on the western hills of the [[Ghorcha Pass]] close to the waters of the [[Barrow Run]]. The settlement is shunned by practically everyone including patrols from [[Lastwall]] and [[Amaans]], while the villagers themselves are suspicious of any strangers approaching. One of the few regular and trusted visitors to Ruwido is the mute [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Desna]] called [[Azra]].
