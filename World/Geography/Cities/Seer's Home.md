> The capital of [[Icemark]], **Seer's Home**, is actually no more than a large village by population size; it is found on the western coast of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. Seer's Home is the largest and the only permanently inhabited [[Varki]] shelter and home to the elderly and wise of Varki culture who have retired to this more permanent residence. This group of wise folk are known as the Varki Seers.
