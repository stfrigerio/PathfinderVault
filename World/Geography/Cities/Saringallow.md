> The [[Isger|Isgeri]] town of **Saringallow** is located on the [[Conerica River]], south of the capital of [[Elidir]].


## History

> The town was founded as a garden estate by the noble [[Cheliax|Chelish]] [[House Sarini|Sarini]] family in [[4425 AR]]. They named it **Sarini's Hollow** and brought in peasants to maintain and farm the land and to act as servants for the more influential members of the noble house. When these nobles began dabbling in [[Diabolism|diabolism]] and [[Witch|witchcraft]], the local populace became concerned, but when virgin daughters began to be found drained of all blood, the peasants rebelled and hanged all the Sarinis. They renamed the town **Sarini Gallows**, but over the following century the name evolved into its current form. Chelish nobles are still treated with great suspicion in Saringallow, and any members of [[House Sarini]] relocating there are quickly convinced to find a new place to live.
