> **Sarkomand** is the ruined former capital of the [[Leng|Plateau of Leng]]. Two pristine [[Sphinx|sphinx]] statues stand atop a pair of stairways descending into the underworld of Leng. By day, the ruins look seemingly abandoned, but at night, black [[Galley|galleys]] dock at the city, carrying [[Denizen of Leng|almost-humans]] that will ruthlessly and violently descend upon any trespassers.
