> **Diepkamer** is a secret [[Duergar|duergar]] fortress in a secluded part of the [[Darklands]] region of [[Nar-Voth]]. Located somewhere beneath [[Taldor|Taldors]] [[World's Edge Mountains|Worlds Edge Mountains]], it is heavily defended by [[Warrior|warriors]] and [[Trap|traps]], and sees few visitors. It is home to the [[Seven Patriarchs]], legendary rulers of the duergar race. Duergar leaders sometimes travel to Diepkamer to consult with the Patriarchs, whose rulings are considered divine law, since they are believed to be in direct communion with [[Droskar]], the [[Deity|god]] behind the genesis of the duergar race.
