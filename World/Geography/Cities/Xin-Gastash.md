> **Xin-Gastash** was the capital of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] [[Gastash|Realm of Gluttony]], and was destroyed by the great event that brought down the rest of the kingdom: [[Earthfall]]. Constructed underground so that the [[Necromancer|necromancers]] of Gastash could practice their arts without the detrimental interference of the [[Sun|sun]], Xin-Gastash was said to have contained Thassilon's greatest bathhouses, [[Drug|drug]] dens, and feast halls. Though much of the city was destroyed and sealed off from outside contact by the earthquakes that shook [[Golarion]] following Earthfall, an obstructed entrance to Xin-Gastash exists beneath the mountain the [[Orc|orcs]] of [[Hold of Belkzen|Belkzen]] call the [[Sleeper]].
