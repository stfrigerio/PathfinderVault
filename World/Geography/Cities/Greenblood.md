> The [[Free Captains]] of the [[Shackles]] established a pit fight on a rock in the sea just off the coast of the [[Sodden Lands]] located northwest of [[Neruma]]. It became known as [[Green Blood on a Black Rock]], and its fame spread as far as [[Avistan]].
> The popularity of the event led to the settlement of Greenblood growing up close to the site. Its population of brigands are considered to be rough and lawless even by Shackles standards.
