> The grim mining town of **Chalk Harbor** is the only functioning settlement on [[Whyrlis Rock]] island in the [[Shackles]]. The town is the base of operations of the [[Slaver|slaver]] Alahandra Boisich, rumored to have once been a powerful baroness of [[Cheliax]]. The ruthless Alahandra captains the [[Barkentine|barkentine]] *[[Cloudbuster's Dream|Cloudbusters Dream]]*.
> There is no wildlife around Chalk Harbor save for bands of [[Earth elemental|earth elementals]] and the few clusters of [[Crysmal|crysmals]] that lair underground, and no one can eat the sparse blighted crops that grow from the rocky soil. Water is drawn from the [[Elsewhere River]], but all food is supplied by other islands and paid for by Alahandra.
