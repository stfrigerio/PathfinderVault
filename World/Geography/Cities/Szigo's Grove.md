> **Szigo's Grove** is the home of Szigo, the [[Cannibal|cannibal]] warlock of the [[Grungir Forest]], who eats his victims in order to gain power. Many [[Adventurer|adventurers]] have attempted to destroy this deranged madman, but Szigo has a sizeable following of violent [[Troll|trolls]] and other monstrous creatures that Szigo has convinced that he is a [[Deity|god]].
> Szigo's minions serve him as both hunter-gatherers and guards for the horde of [[Magic item|magical treasure]] he has amassed over the years. The most famous item in this horde is probably the magical [[Sword|sword]] of Laughing Erik, the hero who supposedly came closest to vanquishing the terrible cannibal.
