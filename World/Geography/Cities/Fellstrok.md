> **Fellstrok** is a [[Duergar|duergar]] stronghold connected via tunnels to the [[Orc|orc]] capital of [[Urgir]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. Fellstrok is one of the larger duergar settlements even though it is only a fraction of the size of [[Hagegraf]]. It was only recently retaken by the gray dwarves, who continue to fight with the neighboring bands of [[Grimlock|grimlocks]], [[Mongrelman|mongrelmen]], and other more dangerous denizens of the [[Darklands]]. Originally built by the [[Dwarf|dwarves]], it was presumably abandoned during that race's [[Quest for Sky]]. As well as native threats from [[Nar-Voth]] the duergar also have to worry about a possible incursion from the surface either by slaughter-hungry orcs or their vengeful dwavern kindred.
> It is linked to the duergar capital of [[Hagegraf]] by the tunnel system known as the [[Long Walk]].
