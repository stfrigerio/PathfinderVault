## Geography

> Kasai sits to the south of the Minkai peninsula just north of the Kamiteki River in the heart of the rich [[Kasai Province]]. Kasai Harbor features a deep-water harbor that is filled with an abundant supply of [[Fish|fish]]. Kasai is a meticulously planned city boasting wide canals and well-defined districts and wards.


#### Beyond the city

> Three peripheral areas lie across the Hebigawa River that, although not considered part of the core of Kasai itself, are nevertheless important districts:

> - [[Hitsugi District]]: unofficially governed by the yakuza
> - [[Red Lantern District]]: entertainment district
> - [[Reeds|The Reeds]]: shanty town

## Government

> Kasai is the capital of Minkai and all power flows from the Imperial Palace from where the emperor rules with total authority from atop the Jade Throne. The city has a strictly defined social hierarchy, with the Emperor, or their regent, at the top.
