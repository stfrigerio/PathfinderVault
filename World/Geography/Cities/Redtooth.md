*For another meaning of "Redtooth", please see [[Redtooth person]].*
> **Redtooth** is the provincial capital of the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] border province known as the [[Verge]]. [[Elvanna|Queen Elvanna]]'s second son, [[Arvanoff Elvanna]], is the Duke of Redtooth.



## History

> Redtooth was founded by [[Jadwiga person|Queen Jadwiga]] in [[3314 AR]] following the [[Winter War]] to serve as the provincial capital of [[Wintercrux]]. When the province of the Verge carved out of Wintercrux in [[3514 AR]] by [[Urvalane|Queen Urvalane]], Redtooth became the capital of the new province and focused on its military mission.


## Layout

> Redtooth is not built on a major waterway as every other provincial capital in Irrisen. The city lacks walls and sits atop a steep hill, encircled with a ring of wooden towers which also serve as barracks for Redtooth's militia, known as the [[Red Claws]]. Duke Arvanoff's impressive stone castle, called the [[Keep of the Hound]], is the center of the government and also the center of military operations. The Keep of the Hound is located in the center of the town. West of the castle are the army's storage silos and east of the castle are the permanent camps of the duke's elite units, known as the [[Queen's Storm|Queens Storm]]. The bulk of the city's population lives in neighborhoods surrounding this military complex.


## Inhabitants

> [[Winter wolf|Winter wolves]] in Redtooth have the power to assume [[Human|human]] form. Every building in the town has its own gated entryway. By ancient agreement, necessary to keep the peace in town, a winter wolf may not open a closed gate without invitation. At night, the winter wolves take on their true, [[Animal|animal]] forms, and howls fill the night air. Most of Redtooth's human residents barricade the doors at night when the winter wolves prowl its darkened streets. [[Rogosh Vix]], the captain of the Red Claws, is a fearful winter wolf although he usually uses his human form.


## Districts

> Seven neighborhoods surround the military complex of Duke's Castle, located between the castle and the ring of wooden towers encircling the town. Nearly half the winter wolves in town live in [[Blue Fang]] district in houses like those of their human neighbors, complete with gated entryways. South of the Blue Fang is the Clawfoot Quarter district with a lot of rowdy taverns, some of which have a few rooms to let. Their common rooms host drinkers who dare not leave for home until the [[Sun|sun]] rises, [[Whitetail]] district and [[Houndsrange]] district are inhabited by Jadwiga middle class and city's armorers. Redtooth's wealthy residents live in the outer neighborhoods of [[Sunrose]], [[Vastborough]] and [[Norborough]]. A number of very wealthy citizens, mostly retired military officers live in gated manors on the outskirts of the town. Redtooth hosts seven "market circles", where temporary markets are set up in the morning and disassembled before dusk five days a week.


### Notable locations

> [[Witchwolf Pit]] is a small complex of caverns in the hill northwest of Redtooth, used by Redtooth's winter wolves as a meeting place.
> The [[Open Claw]] is the town's only inn, and remarkably is not surrounded by a gated fence. Few who spend the night here ever live to see the morning.
> The hill to the east of Redtooth has a pair of cave entrances. The caves are deep and the subterranean passages are unstable. The complex is known as "[[Beast caves|the Beast]]".
