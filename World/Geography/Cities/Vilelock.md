> **Vilelock** is a shady, lawless settlement on the [[Shark Island]] in the [[Shackles]]. As expected, gory brawls, lurking cutpurses, and casual murders are frequent in town.
> A thriving market in Vilelock specializes in the acquisition and sale of exotic [[Poison|poisons]] and [[Alchemical item|alchemical substances]] outlawed in the more civilized nations of the [[Inner Sea region]].
> The town changes overlords often but its current overlord is [[Nisia Gbele]], the [[Mwangi human ethnicity|Mwangi]] captain of the [[Ship|frigate]] *[[Bloody Cudgel]]*.
