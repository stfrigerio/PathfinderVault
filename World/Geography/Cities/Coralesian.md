> The small town of **Coralesian** sits high in the northeastern [[Five Kings Mountains]], and even though it is considered to be within the territory of the [[Dwarf|dwarves]], it has been settled by mostly [[Elf|elves]] from neighboring [[Kyonin]], who live here among the snowcapped peaks and pine trees of the mountains. Some live in small huts in the high alpine meadows, while others have built cliff-dwellings connected by ladders, bridges, and tunnels. No matter where they make their home, however, they all band together to support each other through the long, cold mountain winters.
