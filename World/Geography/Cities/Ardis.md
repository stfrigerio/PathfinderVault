## History

> In [[4534 AR]], an event known as the Great Ardis Fire destroyed parts of the city, including the Gulcharin Sanatorium. The Sanatorium was home to Grivellus Rhodenso, Ustalav's famous "Baron Librarian", and the fire killed him and burnt his priceless library.
> It was once a haven for artists, authors, poets, and the elite of society, until [[Valislav Ordranti|Eunuch Prince Valislav Ordranti]] moved the capital to [[Caliphas]] in [[4674 AR]].
> Ardis is also the birthplace of [[Soividia Ustav]], a legendary hero from the [[Age of Enthronement]], and founder of the nation.
