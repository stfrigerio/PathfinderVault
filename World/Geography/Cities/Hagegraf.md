> **Hagegraf** is the capital of the [[Duergar|duergar]] in [[Nar-Voth]] and is situated on the eastern end of the [[Long Walk]], under the [[Five Kings Mountains]] of north-eastern [[Druma]]. The city's troops patrol the Long Walk, keeping it mostly clear of monsters and extracting tolls from travellers. The city is a place of never-ending, backbreaking work and hardship, as befits a place whose people are dedicated to the worship of the [[Deity|god]] of endless toil, [[Droskar]].


## Geography

> The city takes up the sides of an immense cavern, and resembles a massive arena enclosed by a circle of fortresses. Numerous large stalactites hang down from the cavern's ceiling, linked by a network of bridges; it is here that the city's nobility live.
> The city is home to the massive clock known as the [[Akrizoth Horologe]]. The engineering marvel is acclaimed as one of the wonders of the [[Darklands]], and is a major tourist attraction.


## Inhabitants

> All non-[[Dwarf|dwarves]] are welcome to visit the cityâ€”provided they can pay the 10 [[Gold piece|gold piece]] entry tax for each wagon. There is also a 20 gold piece exit tax per person; those who attempt to leave without paying end up in the city's dungeons. As the duergar are known to be avid [[Slaver|slavers]], caravans full of creatures of all sorts leave on a regular basis for the chattel markets of [[Delvingulf]], [[Sverspume]], and [[Giratayn]].
