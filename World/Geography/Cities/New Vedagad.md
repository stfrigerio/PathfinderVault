> **New Vedagad** is the largest city in the storied [[Vudra|Vudran]] region known as [[The Cradle]]. New Vedagad is actually a reconstruction of **Vedagad**, a city that was lost to earthquakes over two centuries ago. New Vedagad has a direct road to the Vudran capital city of [[Indapatta]], which brings the city a vast amount of wealth. [[Fiery Hak]], the [[Ifrit|ifrit]] mayor of New Vedagad, has grown wealthy off this trade, but local rulers along the route and scoundrels of every stripe plot and scheme about how to siphon off some of this vast wealth into their own coffers.
