> **Leckumgee** is a small village in southern [[Jalmeray]], located on the eastern edge of the [[Segang Jungle]].
> It consists of twenty or so huts, which are raised on stilts to keep out [[Snake|snakes]], other creatures, and to prevent flooding during heavy rain. It does not receive many visitors from the outside world, so only a few of the villagers can manage to speak haltingly in [[Human languages of GolarionTaldane Common|Common]]; most speak only [[Vudrani language|Vudrani]].
