> **Belde** is a town in western [[Cheliax]] situated on the banks on the [[Maiestas River]], between the [[Menador Mountains]] and the [[Barrowood]]. Despite being geographically located in the [[Archduchy of the Heartlands]], it serves as capital of the rebellious [[Archduchy of Hellcoast]].


## Geography

> Sandwiched between the eastern banks of the [[Maiestas River]] and the southwestern [[Barrowood]] in the Heartlands' far western reaches, Belde is isolated from much of Cheliax. The [[Menador Mountains]] dominate the region west of the river. [[Egorian]], the capital of Cheliax, is about 210 miles due east of the town.


## Government

> Belde is ruled by [[House Thrune|House Thrune-appointed]] [[Marcellus Thurivan|Paraduke Marcellus Thurivan]], who nominally oversees the goings-on in all of the Archduchy of Hellcoast. Thurivan is charged with reclaiming Hellcoast from rebels in [[Pezzack]], the archduchy's former capital which has been in open rebellion since [[4710 AR]], as well as the violent, insurrectionist [[Strix|strix]] of [[Devil's Perch|Devils Perch]].
> Thurivan, who replaced the previous ruler of Hellcoast after Pezzack [[Second Ashes|fell to rebellion]], is himself embattled. The residents of Belde view him as little more than a crony of Thrune and openly ignore his laws and tax collectors. Rumors suggest that he is planning on exterminating dissenters instead of more strategic reactions, as House Thrune might punish him if he is unable to restore its rule over western Cheliax.
