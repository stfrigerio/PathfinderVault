> The central city of **Undarin** in the [[Sarkoris Scar]] can be found on the [[Sarkora River]], and was once a center for the selling of livestock and ore in the kingdom of [[Sarkoris]]. Once the city was overrun by [[Demon|demons]] after the opening of the [[Worldwound]] in [[4606 AR]], its stockyards and animal pens were used to temporarily control the [[Human|human]] population before being sent off for further processing. Like most of the cities in the region, the holy warriors of the [[Fifth Mendevian Crusade]] deemed Undarin to be too corrupted to be rebuilt, and instead razed the city in [[4718 AR]].
