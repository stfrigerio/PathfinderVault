> **The Cradle** is a region in the south of [[Vudra]] that features heavily in the country's national mythology. According to [[Vudrani human ethnicity|Vudran]] mythology, the river [[Deity|goddess]] [[Dhavala]] helped sustain the early Vudran civilisation along with a vast forest that once covered much of the Cradle. The forest is now little more than a memory, but Dhavala is still widely worshipped across the region.
> The [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapadas]] of the region are renowned for holding grudges and war is so common that a vast, unsettled region called the [[Plains of Conflict]] where armies can war without destroying the valuable farmland of the region has been left just for this purpose. The mahajanapadas of [[Kaurata]] and [[Pandata]] have been intermittently at war for centuries, with no sign of the conflict abating. The Cradle is also riddled with the ruins of ancient kingdoms such as the haunted, underground city of [[Kabirabad]] and the remnants of the [[Naga|naga]] city of [[Sampadabad]].
> The Cradle boasts some very unusual mahajanapadas, including the [[Vishkanya|vishkanya]] jungle kingdom of [[Tanadesh]] and [[Vaktai]], a port city openly ruled by [[Rakshasa|rakshasa]]. The largest city in the region is [[New Vedagad]], a reconstruction of a city that slid into the [[Embaral Ocean]] over two centuries ago. New Vedagad has a direct road connection with the Vudran capital city [[Indapatta]] which brings enormous wealth to the city.
