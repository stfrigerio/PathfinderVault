> The [[Merfolk|merfolk]] settlement of **Chosovosei** lies at the bottom of a trench approximately 350 miles northwest of the island-nation of [[Hermea]]. Its inhabitants pay outlandish amounts of tribute to the [[Kraken|krakens]] of the Endless Eye, and live in near-constant fear of them. They also maintain good, if cool relations with the [[Gray elf|gray elves]] of the [[Mordant Spire]]. Although the settlement is small by surface-world standards, it is quite sizable for one of the merfolk.
