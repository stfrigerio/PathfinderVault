> **Elesomare** is a small farming and lumber-producing colony, established in [[People's Revolt|pre-revolutionary]] times by the then province of [[Andoran]] on the far-away shores of [[Arcadia]]. As it was overwhelmingly settled by [[Commoner|commoners]] looking for a better life abroad, it greeted Andoran's radical change in government with great hope and sympathy. Being separated from the motherland and the many political and economic compromises that a large government necessitates, the citizens of Elesomare are more idealistic than their counterparts in [[Avistan]]. In recent years, the colonists have been attempting to decrease the local influence of the authoritarian and sometimes brutal [[Lumber Consortium]]. Although the government in [[Almas]] does not support this subtle insurrection, they have been noticeably slow in responding to the Consortium's call for help and reinforcements.


## Segada Protocol

> Through the Segada Protocol, the Arcadian city of [[Segada]] permits Elesomare's existence and grants the colony military protection by the city's forces.
