**Three Hags Rock** is a small, bleak island within the [[Ironbound Archipelago]], located east of [[Battlewall]] island, and part of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of the [[Ironbound Islands]].


## Inhabitants

> The island features little plant life. Three Hags Rock's main inhabitants are the giant [[Roc|rocs]] who nest atop its mountains and hunt the surrounding seas. There have long been rumours of caves beneath Three Hags Rock that harbour [[Sea hag|sea hags]] but no one has ever confirmed this. 


## Legend

> Three Hags Rock is named for three craggy mountains; legend claims each is the grave of an ancient [[Annis hag|annis hag]] so ugly that when they died, the [[Moon|moon]] [[Deity|goddess]] [[Desna]] raised three tors to hide each of their hideous corpses from the world.
