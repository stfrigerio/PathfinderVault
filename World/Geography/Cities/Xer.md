> **Xer** (pronounced ZER) is an important port on the banks of [[Lake Encarthan]] and the [[Glass River]]. It serves as one of the two main ports for all [[Razmiran]], and much of the trade goods that flow from across the lake are funnelled through Xer. The importance of Xer means it is tightly controlled by the priests of [[Razmir]], who collect tithes from every business in Xerâ€”since anyone who lives in Xer must be a worshiper of Razmir, they collect from everyone.
> Unfortunately for those who visit the city, the priests aren't fussy about who they demand tithes from, and happily "indoctrinate" any foreign sailor or merchant with the tenets of Razmir's religion until they agree to the "willing donation" asked of them. Even worse, this sort of behaviour is not just limited to those who walk the streets of Xer. Faith barges piloted by Razmir's masked priests sail the surrounding waters, boarding the ships of those who are not making port in Xer to spread the word of their faith (generally by bullying non-believers) and collect tithes (by demanding tribute to pass). 
> Rumour suggests that because Xer was the first city Razmir conquered when he came to the area, some of its inhabitants remember certain secrets that the faithful would deem blasphemy, including the fact that Xer might be home to a number of bastard offspring of the Living God.
