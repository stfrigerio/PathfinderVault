> **The Petal District** lies in the northwestern part of [[Absalom]], east of the [[Ascendant Court]]. It rests atop the Watercleft cliff face upon a rise of land known as Aroden's Hill. Known as the wealthiest district of the City at the Center of the World, it is also home to the most powerful noble families. The district's name comes from the well-maintained rows of flowers that run down the center of almost every paved street in brick-framed medians. In the opulent palaces, decadent balconies, and elaborate gardens of the rich and powerful lies the dark truth of the life of the upper classes, who constantly vie for power through [[Poison|poison]] and murder as often as armistice and negotiation, and seek to outdo their neighbors in the opulence of their estates.


## Government

> Unlike the other district heads that are referred to as [[Nomarch|nomarchs]], the proper form of address of the head of the Petal District council is satrap.
