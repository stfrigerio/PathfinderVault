> **Stethelos**, also known as the **Green Meadow**, is the mysterious, legendary city at the centre of the [[Dimension of Time]].



## Geography

> Visitors to the Dimension of Time arrive at the [[Desolate Shore]], next to the ominous Viridescent Jungle, and can see the Green Meadow across the Billowy Sea before a [[Raft|raft]] detaches from the Desolate Shore and carries them to Stethelos. The Desolate Shore then falls away behind, unreachable from the Green Meadow.
> The island of Stethelos stands at the centre of the Billowy Sea, surrounded by the Cataracts, a vast wall of flowing [[Time|time]] which manifests as water cascading around the borders of Stethelos. The entire island is covered in anima mundi, which manifests as a thick, ubiquitous, green mossy growth which emits a strange singing sound. On closer examination, the anima mundi can be seen growing on old stone structures which are continually worn down by the anima mundi while being simultaneously repaired by the Dimension of Time's [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]]. Looming above all buildings is a 225-foot-tall porphyry dome covering the Well of All, source of the anima mundi and the convergence point of the flow of time.


## Government

> The Caretaker of the Green Meadow is the [[Great Old One]] [[Tawil at'Umr|Tawil atUmr]], the [[Humanoid|humanoid]]-shaped (but still alien) avatar of the [[Outer God]] [[Yog-Sothoth]], who watches events from the Well of All.


## Inhabitants

> Most of Stethelos' residents are natives of the Dimension of Time, who gather here before travelling to the outer reaches of time. Unbound petitioners float forever across its streets, and their only purpose is to repair the buildings being worn down by the anima mundi while being protected by [[Fate irii|Fate iriis]]. Stethelos also serves as a place where travellers from countless places can trade, study for secrets hidden from the rest of reality, and interact with the flow of time itself. An equal number of the Green Meadow's inhabitants are forever lost, with their memories forgotten and their desire to leave non-existent.
