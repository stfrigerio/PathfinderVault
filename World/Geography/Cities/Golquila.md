> **Golquila** is one of the numerous prosperous port cities that rim the [[Betul Sea]] in the [[Western Ghats]] region of the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]]; it is a walled city with its defences enhanced by being built into the mountains. Further protection for the city is provided by two huge [[Gorilla|gorillas]] and their keepers who stay close by the city. Golquila sits at one end of the [[Seabound Road]], which with its completion heralded a new era of prosperity for the once-desolate region of the Western Ghats.
