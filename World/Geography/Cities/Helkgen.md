> **Helkgen** is a small town on the shores of [[Glacier Lake]] in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of [[Bleakmarch]].
> The [[Ulfen]] residents of Helkgen are struggling to support the merchant ships hugging the shores of Glacier Lake as [[Jadwiga]] overlords demand, but also to collect sufficient tribute throughout the year to give to the unforgiving [[Scrag|scrags]] of [[Scrag Deep]].
> The current Helkgen's mayor is [[Valka Dagsdottir]] who is earning the ire of townsfolk while working hard keeping them safe from the scrags.
