> **Gujaraldi** is the capital of [[Xopatl]], located in the central part of the country.


## History

> Gujaraldi was built among the ruins of ancient hero-god settlements.


## People

> Gujaraldi is known for fine [[Art|arts]] and crafts, particularly textile production: many popular [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] fashions originate in Gujaraldi. Xopatl Stadium, a boundball stadium with thousands of seats, is one of the seven venues selected for Arcadia's annual boundball tournament, easily large enough for the tourists who come to watch the event.
