> Sat on the edge of the [[Okaiyo Ocean]], **Hiyosai** is the city that serves as the capital of the [[Hiyosai Province]] of [[Minkai]]. Hiyosai Province is known as "the eastern treasury of Minkai" due to the rich copper mines that sit to the south of the city of Hiyosai. Unfortunately, Hiyosai is regularly attacked by ferocious [[Siyokoy|siyokoy]] that dwell amongst the coral-encrusted ruins of Sangoshi. As a result of this the harbor guard and local [[Samurai|samurai]] train endlessly with various pole arms to help them repel aquatic attacks.
