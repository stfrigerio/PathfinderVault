> **Lod** is a small [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] town near the headwaters of the [[Marbleflow River]] in [[Hoarwood province]].
> Lod is the first stop of the trade path north along the Marbleflow River. The town welcomes [[Varisian]] merchants and its river front is full of wharves and warehouses. A dry dock called [[Cold Queen Waters]] repairs damaged barges and also crafts and sells small riverboats. Seven inns are close to the docks serving the merchants, riverboat captains, and their crews. The [[Boar's Head|Boars Head]] inn is renowned for its attached brothel and gambling house, run by the siblings [[Grevel Nabotov|Grevel]] and [[Holz Nabotov]]. Other known inns in the docks are the [[Sister Helena's|Sister Helenas]] and the [[Warm Doxy]].
> The wealthy widowed owner of half a dozen warehouses, [[Vilma Lochnik]] is secretly a member of the underground anti-government movement [[Heralds of Summer's Return|Heralds of Summers Return]]. Vilma is efficient in smuggling refugees out of Irrisen.
> [[Arisa|Baroness Arisa]] is the ruler of the town of Lod. She has tried to open an overland trade path between Lod and the provincial capital of [[Hoarwood]] through the forest but she cannot deal with a strangely well-organized group of bandits called the [[Bitter Brotherhood]].
