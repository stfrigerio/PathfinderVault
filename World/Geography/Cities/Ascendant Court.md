> At the center of the [[City at the Center of the World]] lies the **Ascendant Court**â€”Absalom's religious hub, the site of [[Ascension|ascension]] of four [[Deity|gods]], and the final resting place of the [[Starstone]] itself. The Ascendant Court is the religious center of Absalom, holding the preponderance of the city's temples as well as [[Starstone Cathedral]]. Located at the physical center of Absalom, it serves as a hub between other districts: all roads in the Ascendant Court lead to the Starstone. Aside from the many temples, the district's most notable locations include the [[Avenue of the Hopeful]], the [[God's Market|Gods Market]], the [[Chelish embassy]] housed in the former temple of [[Aroden]], and the [[Black Mask]], a costume shop that transforms into a temple to [[Norgorber]] at night.



## Geography

> The Ascendant Court lies at the heart of Absalom, with the [[Petal District]] to the east, the [[Coins]] to the south, the [[Ivy District]] and the [[Foreign Quarter]] to the west, and the [[Wise Quarter]] and [[Azlanti Keep]] to the north. At the center of the district lies the Starstone Cathedral, which sits atop a massive pillar of rock, surrounded by a seemingly bottomless chasm. The Cathedral is connected to the rest of the district via three bridges, one for each of the gods ([[Iomedae]], [[Cayden Cailean]], and [[Norgorber]]) who passed the [[Test of the Starstone]] and achieved immortality here. A fourth bridge tied to the lost god [[Aroden]] was destroyed in the massive earthquake of [[4698 AR]] that damaged so much of the rest of the city, and has not been repaired since.


## Government

> The [[Government of AbsalomDistrict councils|district council]] of the Ascendant Court is called the **Chamber of Ecclestials**, which is headed by nomarch [[Sindoi of the Thousand Poems]] and includes representatives of the all the major temples of the district. The nomarch is only rarely a member of any of the district churches, traditionally being assigned to a [[Vudrani]] sage. Since the council is often more occupied with holy day celebrations, weddings, funerals, and religious observances, much of the day-to-day running of the district is performed by the [[Government of AbsalomLow Council|Low Council]].


## District Guard

> The [[Graycloaks]] are the Ascendant Court's district guard, and consists only of declared nonbelievers who reject the status of the gods as anything other than powerful entities unworthy of worship.


## Religion

 
 [[Iomedae]] greets her followers before the [[Starstone Cathedral]].
> While the Starstone Cathedral is undoubtedly the heart of the district, the Ascendant Court is notable for its concentrated mass of religious centers and for the spectacle surrounding the great and holy chasm. Not far from the Starstone Cathedral one can find a number of major temples such as [[Sarenrae|Sarenraes]] [[Temple of the Shining Star]], the [[Pleasure Salon of Calistria]], [[Cayden's Hall|Caydens Hall]], [[Blackfingers Temple]] and the [[Seventh Church]], site of one of [[Iomedae]]'s 11 miraculous acts. Even the [[Cathedral of the Fallen]] honors those who attempted and failed at the [[Test of the Starstone]].


### Pilgrims and zealots

> Religious fervor and zealotry can be found in the streets and plazas of the Ascendant Court as well, as pilgrims, fools, heroes with aspirations of divinity, and gawkers who don't care whether they witness a success or a failure all flock to this holy site. Others come to write their wishes on pieces of paper and then drop them into the pit surrounding the Starstone Cathedral. With the crowds, of course, come those interested in pilfering a few purses or running a little racket at the expense of the out-of-town rubes. Religious conflicts are rare; the last major riot happened on [[Devil's Night|Devils Night]] in the late 4690s AR, when displaced nobles from [[Cheliax]] fought the guard to burn down the temple of [[Asmodeus]].
