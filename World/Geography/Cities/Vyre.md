> **This article might require [[PathfinderWikiCleanup|cleanup]].**
The specific problem is: Needs to be heavily rewritten for the [[Pathfinder Lost Omens]] setting.Please help [[httpspathfinderwikicomwindexphptitleVyreactionedit|improve it]] if you can; the [[TalkVyre|talk page]] might contain suggestions.This article has been tagged since **18:14, 5 October 2019 (UTC)**.


> The decadent independent port city of **Vyre**, the **City of Masks**, is located on [[Vyre Island]] in [[Nisroch Bay]]. Unbeknownst to the public, it is the birthplace of the [[Deity|god]] [[Norgorber]]. It is also the birthplace and home of the centuries-old [[Skinsaw Cult]].



## Geography

> The city of Vyre is located on an [[Vyre Island|island of the same name]] with a shallow harborâ€”[[Keelwrack Harbor]]. The city sprawls up and between two hills and across two smaller harbor islands, jagged [[Dunrock]] and luxurious [[Keelwrack Island]]. The [[Vyre River]] flows east from the island and cuts through the city on its way to Keelwrack Harbor.
> The city's sky is often hazy with smoke, and between the salty harbor and many pungent eateries and perfumes of its streets, Vyre has as much a geography of scents as it does physical streets and districts.


### Districts

> Vyre is divided into several districts:

> - [[Bliss]]: The most popular district, Bliss consists of the Sanctuary, Cradle, and Nightcrown neighborhoods, the [[Opal Market]], and many venues for various vices.
> - [[Keelwrack]]: Comprised of Dunrock and Keelwrack islands, and containing [[Dunrock Prison]] and [[Vyre Palace]].
> - [[Pauper's Palace|Paupers Palace]]: The city's largest district, largely comprised of private residences.
> - [[Vise|The Vise]]: Comprised of the Old Vyre and Southmarket subdistricts, including inns, hostels, and brothels.
> The [[Sewers Vyre|sewers]] of Vyre, while not a formal city district, are inhabited by criminal organizations and numerous monsters.


## Government

> A largely freewheeling and chaotic city, Vyre is not entirely without laws. Five rules known as "Promises" govern all residents and visitors, compact enough to be carved near statues throughout the city:

"I Shall Honor All Coin", meaning all transactions are assumed final and binding and all prices are negotiable. This rule also prohibits theft.
"I Shall Speak Many Names", meaning all people should accept any name given by a person Vyre, regardless of its veracity, and without ever revealing a person's identity if they conceal it.
"I May Wound Yet Shall Not Kill", which requires people to let their enemies in Vyre live in order to give them a chance to avenge themselves.
"I Know None Are Below Me", which discourages all forms of prejudice and discrimination.
"I Shall Let Closed Doors Remain Closed", meaning all private secrets and acts must remain private, and any broken promises are assumed to be intact unless sufficient evidence is provided.
> Each Promise has a corresponding self-styled monarch responsible for its enforcement. These "kings" and "queens" are Vyre's rulers, though their identities are kept secret. Specialized peacekeepers enforce Vyre's laws and are rewarded well for their work. Those who violate Vyre's laws are sent to [[Dunrock Prison]], many of whom don't survive their sentences. Vyre also provides guards and supplies to the nearby prison mine of [[Deepmar]].


### Masks of Vyre

***Main article: [[Masks of Vyre]]***
> The Masks of Vyre serve each of the city's kings and queens and police their liege's representative Promise in the city, with the Masks of Blades acting as city guards and the Masks of Keys manning its walls and defenses. These specialized peacekeepers are rewarded well for their work.


### Relationship with Cheliax

> Prior to [[Ravounel|Ravounels]] independence, Vyre had a mutual relationship with Cheliax, but was otherwise largely exempt from many of its laws thanks to clever management by Vyre's ruling class. The City of Masks served as a conveniently discreet destination for supporters of [[House Thrune]], but maintained its independence.
> After Ravounel's independence, Vyre continues to operate independently but has publicly supported the new nation.


## History

> Vyre was founded in [[1673 AR]], more than [[3007 AR|1300 years before Cheliax]], by settlers from [[Taldor]]-ruled [[Corentyn]]. It quickly established a reputation as a home for exotic and parlous pursuits.
> When Ravounel seceded from Cheliax, the Kings and Queens of Vyre publicly endorsed Domina [[Jilia Bainilus]], the nation's new ruler, in exchange for her promising to leave the city's independence and questionable trade policies intact.


## People

> Per its nickname as the City of Masks, Vyre's residents and visitors often conceal their identities behind masks, both for anonymity and to ease their committing of immoral acts which make up much of the city's culture. The city presents a near-constant churn of debauchery, bloodsport, and gluttony, though largely nocturnal in nature as its patrons recover during the daytime hours.


### Church of Norgorber

> Few, if any, people outside of the Church of Norgorber know that the god of secrets was born in Vyre as a [[Mortal|mortal]] and lived there before his [[Test of the Starstone|ascension]]. While Vyre is a center of his worship in the [[Inner Sea region]], his portfolio accordingly mandates that it stays extremely well concealed.


### Hellknights

> Under Cheliax, all [[Hellknights|Hellknight]] orders dispatched armigers to Vyre, where they volunteered their services toward maintaining Vyre's laws without pay before submitting to their order for membership.


> [[Paizo]] published a poster map of Vyre in the *[[Hell's Rebels Poster Map Folio|Hells Rebels Poster Map Folio]]* and a major article about the city in *[[Dance of the Damned]]*.
