> **Stark Point** is a trading post on the [[River of Lost Tears]] in the extreme east of [[Sargava]]. It is southeast of [[Fort Bandu]] and north of [[Kalabuto]].
> It was founded in [[4414 AR]] as a mining community under the leadership of the church of [[Aroden]]. As a result, in addition to an inn, stable, and general store, it also boasts a surprisingly large cathedral. However, the mineral deposits were eventually exhausted, and the death of Aroden led to the cathedral being closed down and boarded up. Most of the population soon relocated to Kalabuto, and Stark Point become little more than a general store.
> The abandoned cathedral might be haunted, and some have claimed to have seen strange lights and heard chanting coming from within.
> In [[4690 AR]], the Sclerizi brothersâ€”Arno, Carlo, Gudo, and Ikhaiaâ€”bought the store and converted it into a trading post.
