> **Pier's End** is a small, squalid fishing village on the north coast of the [[Isle of Kortos]] within the domain of the city-state of [[Absalom]]. It is surrounded by a hard-to-cross bog known as the [[Dunmire]].



## Geography

> Pier's End sits on a deep natural harbor on the Isle of Kortos' northern shore. Even though is is located less than 100 miles north-northwest of the city of Absalom as the crow flies, the dense [[Immenwood]], trackless Dunmire swamp, and high [[Kortos Mounts|mountains]] between them make the short journey a difficult one.


## Economy

> Only 24 miles south by sea of the important naval port of [[Escadar]], and with such a difficult overland journey to Absalom, Pier's End's economy is small. While small, Pier's End has a marketplace for [[Adventurer|adventurers]] to resupply, a warm inn, and cheap ferry rides to Escadar.


## Notable Residents

> - Mayor Regis Coombs
> - Harbor Mistress Namia Ruan
> - Crazy Old Tanner: A wild-eyed, pipe-smoking old man who considers himself married to an unfaithful mistress: the sea. He smells of [[Fish|fish]], bemoans change, but is a respected sailor.
> - Darice Sumore: A surly young woman with no love of the [[Pathfinder Society]].
> - Small Otti: A rotund [[Halfling|halfling]] who loves the finer things in life and is willing to joke about his weight.
