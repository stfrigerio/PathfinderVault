> For 800 years, **Westcrown** was the capital of [[Cheliax]], and the rumored birthplace and home of the god [[Aroden]]. Known as the "City of Nine Stars", it was a shining example of the greatness of the Chelish empire. Westcrown was a classic, enlightened metropolis, even a rival to [[Absalom]] as a destination of religious pilgrimage and tourism. But then tragedy struck: [[Aroden]] died in [[4606 AR]], a [[Chelish Civil War|bloody civil war]] swept over the nation, and decades of turmoil and strife plunged the city into despair. The ascension of the [[House Thrune]] to the Chelish throne in [[4640 AR]] cemented Westcrown's fate, as the capital was moved north to [[Egorian]]; no longer the City of Nine Stars, Westcrown now became the City of Twilight. The remains of the Chelish nobility huddle in Westcrown as a home-in-exile, as the city itself crumbles under the weight of mismanagement, crime, and a mysterious plague of creatures that hunt the streets at night.
> As of [[4716 AR]], Westcrown finds itself the target of an uprising led by the [[Glorious Reclamation]], an [[Iomedae|Iomedaean]] group of [[Knight|knights]] opposed to [[House Thrune]].



## Economy

> Because of its excellent location on the [[Inner Sea]] coast, Westcrown is an extremely active shipping port. All sorts of goods and items traverse Westcrown's port, both to and from points throughout Cheliax via the powerful [[Adivian River]], which flows into the city from the north under the Adivian Bridge. The city is speckled with numerous warehouses and docks, and in the mornings Westcrown has the spirit of a active, mercantile city.
> The center of trading and commerce is located at the Trivardum, a large, slate-shingled building that houses all sorts of merchants, taverns, ambassadors, and government offices.
> The western side of the city hosts the Parego Spera ("Hope's Altar"), a thriving, bustling commerce district filled with scribes, printers, money lenders, blacksmiths, tanneries, and the like.
> The ruins in the northern part of the city are the home of the legendary [[Dusk Market]], a wandering bazaar which boasts all manner of illegal and hard-to-find goods and services: [[Drugs|drugs]], [[Slavery|slaves]], [[Poison|poisons]], strange creatures, and prostitutes. The market is the headquarters of many criminal organizations that control the market.


## Government

***Main article: [[Government of Westcrown]]***
> The offices of the Lord Mayor and those of the patriarchs of the local noble houses form the legitimate government of Westcrown, though the city is thoroughly militarised and much of the power lies in the hands of various branches of the soldiery, known as the [[Dottari|dottari]]. Behind this faÃ§ade, though, money is the real power in mercantile Westcrown, and no group's coffers run as deep as the legendary [[Council of Thieves]].


## Geography

> Westcrown is a major port city in southern [[Cheliax]], approximately 150 miles south of [[Egorian]], where the Adivian River flows into the [[Inner Sea]]. The city itself consists of islands and canals amid the center of the Adivian, a few hundred yards south of the river branching off of the Dhaenflow. The [[Dhaenfens]] lie to the west of the city, beyond which lie the [[Turanian Hills]]. To the south where the river flows into [[Gemcrown Bay]], the [[Rifardona|Reef of Aroden]] protects the city's harbor from the worst of the tides.
> The city proper is located southwest from the fey-infested [[Hagwood]].


## Districts

***Main article: [[City districts of Westcrown]]***
> Westcrown is divided into three districts called paregos, each sub-divided into smaller regions called regos.
> The Parego Regicona is the local name for the large island in the centre of the city formed by two branches of the Adivian River, namely the Westchannel and the Southrun. The island is divided by a number of canals and surrounded by an encircling wall with chained arches spanning the entrances to the internal canals. In times of war and civil disobedience chains can be hoisted between the arches to prevent access to the Regicona. Lifting bridges cross the canals at regular intervals which can be hoisted aloft to allow the passage of water craft through the city. It is divided into Rego Corna, Rego Laina, and Rego Aerum. 
> The Parego Dospera is the northern section of the city that has fallen into ruin. It was once known as Rego Plea, and is now divided into Rego Cader and Rego Crua. 
> Parego Spera is the still-prosperous district where trade trumps politics. The longest canal in the city can be found in Parego Spera, as well as the two great Pegasi Bridges, which date back to the days of Aroden. The three sub-sectors that make up Parego Spera are Rego Scripa, Rego Pena, and Rego Sacero.


## History

***Main article: History of Westcrown***
> On the orders of [[Stavian I|Emperor Stavian I]] of [[Taldor]], [[Engineer|engineers]] constructed a series of arches, now known as the [[Stavian Arches]], along the Adivian River. By [[3850 AR]], smaller boats could be pulled up beside the falls by pulleys and ropes. This period of construction was briefly interrupted by the [[Even-Tongued Conquest]] in [[4081 AR]]. Although the town remained loyal to Taldor, the [[Taldan Phalanx|Phalanx]] contingent garrisoning Westcrown was defeated and the city was annexed by Cheliax in the Siege of Westcrown.
> Construction continued, and by [[4100 AR]], the great stone arches meant even medium-sized vessels could traverse the powerful and tumultuous South Adivian to Lake Rikkan. Completed in [[4085 AR]], the Third Stavian Arch allowed even the largest ships to be hauled further upriver for access to [[Lake Sorrow]].
> Of all the cities in Golarion, none suffered so badly from the death of [[Aroden]] in [[4606 AR]] as did Westcrown. Rioting broke out onto the streets as panic engulfed the city. The mayor, Norren Betevesk was murdered during riots and the mayoral manor partially destroyed. The chaos led to civil war, which was to continue until the rise of [[House Thrune]] and the appointment of mayor [[Anvengen Doskivari]] in [[4640 AR]]. The capital of [[Cheliax]] moved to [[Egorian]], and Westcrown became a shadow of its former glory. The mayor disappears mysteriously in his mayor and is replaced by the wizard Daregntu Vheed in [[4661 AR]].
> The destruction of the Third Stavian Arch in [[4660 AR]] prevented larger boats and forces easy access to the capital of Cheliax. Since [[4674 AR]], the Imperial Navy frequently occupy Westcrown, ever watchful for traitors to House Thrune's rule, believing that those responsible for the sabotage are still fermenting dissent.
> In [[4676 AR]], the true oppression of Westcrown begins as strange, shadowy beasts appear at night. Attempts to destroy the beasts have little true success, and a curfew was declared that stands to this day.
> In [[4716 AR]], knights of the Glorious Reclamationâ€”Iomedean rebels against the rule of House Thruneâ€”began gathering support and marching toward Westcrown after a daring raid on the [[Hellknights|Hellknight]] [[Order of the Godclaw]]. The brazen rebellion diverted much of House Thrune's resources toward Westcrown, leaving other parts of Cheliax (namely [[Kintargo]] and the [[Archduchy of Ravounel]]) to also rebel.


## Crime

*See also: [[Council of Thieves]]*
> The Westcrown criminal underground is ruled by the legendary crime syndicate, the Council of Thieves. Thought by most to be a myth, the stuff of legend, the group is in fact alive and well, maintaining a firm grip on the city's slave trade, drug trafficking, smuggled goods, bribery, extortion, racketeering, money laundering, and assassination.
> Officially, the Council was declared destroyed by Queen Koradinna in [[4469 AR]], but in fact the Council was given legitimate power over Westcrown in exchange for regular payments to the government and with the assurance that the streets of Westcrown would be kept safe. Several criminals, most of whom were scapegoats, were publicly executed and the Council of Thieves was said to be no more. 


## Inhabitants

***Main article: Inhabitants of Westcrown***
*See also: [[CategoryWestcrownInhabitants]]*
> Aside from [[Human|humans]], many other residents of Westcrown are [[Halfling|halflings]]. Many [[Half-elf|half-elves]] live in Westcrown due to its reputation as a place where society's leftovers live, and [[Tiefling|tieflings]] take the brunt of society's scorn toward mixed-race inhabitants.
> Westcrown's sewers are known to harbor gelatinous "ooze bugs" known as [[Torble|torbles]], which local [[Wizard|wizards]] sometimes take as [[Familiar|familiars]].
> Notable citizens of Westcrown include:
> - [[Aberian Arvanxi]], Lord Mayor of Westcrown and Patriarch of [[House Arvanxi]]
> - [[Asad Grulios]], Patriarch of [[House Grulios]]
> - [[Bartolo Mezinas]], Patriarch of [[House Mezinas]]

> - [[Vassindio Drovenge]], Patriarch of [[House Drovenge]]
> - [[Vourne|General Vourne]], commander of the [[Gemcrown Bay]] imperial fleets

## Religion

> Although the Chelish nobility openly pays lip service to [[Asmodeus]], Westcrown was once a center of worship to [[Aroden]] and the majority of current residents less openly follow deities common in other lands. Clerics of [[Iomedae]] have taken up Aroden's mantle, and followers of [[Erastil]] and [[Abadar]] have established small temples. As in other parts of Cheliax, followers of [[Shelyn]] openly practice their ceremonies.
> Westcrown is the setting for *[[Hell Comes to Westcrown]]*, and Paizo published a major article about the city in that volume titled "Westcrown Under the Glorious Reclamation".
