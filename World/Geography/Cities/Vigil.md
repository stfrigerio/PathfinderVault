> **Vigil** was not only a mighty fortress that drew warriors of [[Good|good]] like a beacon, but also the capital of the country of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]]. It was a city of [[Music|music]], joy, and faith that came to a terrible end in the summer of [[4719 AR]] when the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] escaped from his centuries-long confinement and unleashed the destructive weapon known as the *Radiant Fire* upon the city, destroying it completely. Its ruined remains now mar the [[Gravelands]].



## Geography

> Before its destruction, two concentric walls circled Vigil, with the exception of the opening of its small harbor on the [[Path River]]. The thick outer wall and towers were made of granite and surrounded by a wide moat filled with water from the river. The southeast and northwest gatehouses and the six towers of the outer wall were always bathed in [[Magic|magically]] created light. The inner wall rose higher than the outer wall and was whitewashed, as was all of the city and [[Castle Overwatch]] within. The walls had ballistae, catapults, and trebuchets, and were guarded day and night. Gardens with flowers, [[Animal|animal]] pens, and sheds lay between the two walls, tended by [[Erastil|Erastils]] faithful. Most of the buildings of the city were simple, blocky, and solid, but some examples of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] Old White style existed as well, such as the five [[Tribunes|Tribune Halls]] and the [[Pathfinder lodge]]. The streets and alleys of the city were clear and even the market stalls and carts were packed by nightfall. In the center of Vigil, a rocky hill named [[Watcher's Tor|Watchers Tor]] rose with the towering Castle Overwatch at its peak. Hedgerows of hardy dawnroses covered the lower slopes of Watcher's Tor, and wild climbing roses scaled even the steeper slopes below the central keep and the towering citadel. The magnificent [[Cathedral of Sancta Iomedaea]] lay at the foot of the Watcher's Tor.
> Vigil once faced [[Gallowspire]] to the north and the [[Hold of Belkzen]] to the northwest. The Crusader Highway connected Vigil with [[Vellumis]] to the southeast.


## History

> Vigil was founded at the height of [[Taldor|Taldors]] Golden Age at the conclusion of the [[Shining Crusade]] as a glorious symbol of the triumphant empire, literally its "last wall". It was established at the site of the long-lost trade village of [[Rookmin]]. Once a part of the nation of [[Ustalav]], the village, as well as its [[Salt|salt]] mines and granite quarries were abandoned when the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] raised the [[Orc|orc]] hordes in [[3203 AR]]. During the Shining Crusade, the armies fighting the [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] established [[Fort Lorrin]] as a supply depot at the sight of the abandoned village. It was at this fort in [[3823 AR]], that the [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Iomedae]] rallied the [[Knights of Ozem]] and launched her famous counterstroke that routed the Whispering Tyrant's hordes back to [[Gallowspire]]. Sadly, it would take three more years and countless lives before he was finally defeated and imprisoned. Wishing to forevermore keep an eye on the vanquished, yet not destroyed lich-king, Taldor chose to establish a new city at Fort Lorrin, unburdened by past allegiances and corruption, which would became the shield of the world; thus was Vigil founded.


## Government

> The [[Watcher-Lord]] of Lastwall resided in Vigil and possessed final authority "over all matters relevant to the prosecution of the Crusade". Below him, the five [[Precentors Martial]] governed military affairs and the five [[Tribunes]] governed civil matters. The five Precentors Martial had the authority to exploit civil resources, but rarely made use of it. Each of the Precentors Martial had a separate title that described their jurisdictions: the Precentor Martial for Cavalry, the Precentor Martial for Infantry, the Precentor Martial for Garrison and Siege, the Precentor Martial for Scouting, and the Precentor Martial for Magic.
> Citizenship in Vigil was strictly controlled by the Tribunes. Applicants had to state their reasons for wanting to become a citizen of Lastwall to a Tribune, and if they were accepted, received the [[Shield-Mark]], a *mark of justice*, in the shape of a Lastwall [[Shield|shield]], upon the right palm. The Shield-Mark sealed their oaths of loyalty to support the crusade and its ideals, and to treat citizens and strangers alike with fairness, honesty, and respect. Individuals asking to join the Vigilant soldiers had to meet with a Precentor Martial and swear to faithfully serve their commanders, to protect the citizens even at the risk of their own life, to temper justice with mercy, and to uphold the crusader ideal. They receive the [[Sword-Mark]], a second *mark of justice* in the shape of Iomedae's symbol, upon the right palm. The oaths were hard, but those who bore no mark (known as the Oathless) could not own property or businesses in Vigil. In Vigil, the marks were considered a recognition of kinship in the mission of the city.


## Industry

> The fields around Vigil were home to numerous ranches that bred the mighty warhorses the soldiers of Lastwall rode into battle.
