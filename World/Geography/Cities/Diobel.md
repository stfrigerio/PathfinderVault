> **Diobel** is one of the larger towns under the rule of the city-state of [[Absalom]]. While not as large as [[Escadar]] off the isle's northern coast, Diobel plays an important role in the commercial and political affairs of the City at the Center of the World.



## Geography

> On the western coast of the [[Isle of Kortos]], where once stood a mighty siege town, rests the flooded port city of Diobel. The city's inner harbor is protected by a giant maze of shipwrecked war-barges, crumbling walls, and haphazard jetties of [[Iron|iron]] and wood. These defenses prevent larger trading vessels and [[Ship|warships]] from entering the harbor itself, and the deeper waters of the bay are often crowded with [[Ship|ships]] at anchor. Inside the maze lies a wide bay called the Shallows, which provides calm waters and safe passage to the smaller [[Rowboat|rowboats]] and flat-bottomed cargo vessels.  The Shallows flow into a series of wooden and stone walkways, which stretch below the city, possessing various docks and bunkers called the Underdocks. Most of the town stands suspended on pylons above the Underdocks, or hangs precariously on the rocky shore of the bay. The shipwrecks and debris that protect Diobel's harbor from [[Pirate|pirates]] and sea monsters were erected in imitation of Absalom's [[Flotsam Graveyard]].
> The town has a narrow river that flows through it and into the sea, the [[Deluge River|Deluge]], on which timber cut in the [[Immenwood]] is floated down for market.


### Sections of town

*See also: [[CategoryDiobelLocations]]*
> - The **Bristles District** is the southern district of Diobel and home to low-rate inns, markets, and taverns, as well as warehouses and poorer family homes. Ship builders and [[Gillmen|gillmen]] also operate heavily in the district.
> - The **Claw District** or Claw is a region on the the northeastern outskirts of Diobel. It is part of the "in-land" that Diobelians rarely refer to fondly. Old Diobelian families maintain camps here and explorers make this their last stop on the way to explore the island.
> - The **Snout District** or Snout is in the north-central part of town and is home to the middle-class, old families, traders, and artisans.

## Economy

> Diobel began mainly as a fishing village before it developed an oyster- and pearl-gathering industry that supplies pearls not only to the [[Arcanamirium]], Absalom's premier school of [[Magic|magic]], but exports them throughout the [[Inner Sea region]], where they are considered some of the finest to be found anywhere. The [[Skymetal|skymetals]] harvested from the hills surrounding Diobel or recovered from the ocean floor and traded by [[Low Azlanti]] are also a highly-prized export. Timber, iron, and precious metals are shipped down the Deluge River to Diobel where they are shipped off to supply Absalom's many crafters.
> Diobel has become a bustling trade town controlled by the merchant lords of the [[Kortos Consortium]], who oversee much of Absalom's mining, farming, trapping, and fishing industry. Smugglers and food merchants have preferred to ship goods to Absalom through Diobel for centuries in order to avoid Absalom's stiff harbor taxes, its law enforcement, and its criminal element. This popularity has made Diobel one of the largest markets for contraband in the Inner Sea region.
> Ships anchor in the harbor and transport their goods to shore over the Shallows in large barges. Traders meet with caravan captains at the [[Harpy's Gate|Harpys Gate]] to arrange overland transport. The caravans between Diobel and Absalom, which trade furs, timber, and food from independent farms along the dangerous route, are a major source of Absalom's food supply.


## Government

> Diobel's chief governor is known as the [[Teriarch]], a position appointed by the [[Government of AbsalomGrand Council|Grand Council]] of Absalom. The current ruler of the city is [[Avid Arnsen|Lord Avid]] of [[House Arnsen]], a childhood friend (and now bitter rival) of Absalom's former [[Primarch|primarch]], [[Lord Gyr]].
> Lord Avid's main political rival in Diobel is the Kortos Consortium, a guild of merchants that controls significant parts of the town's trade. The Consortium is a merchant's guild, claiming to be dedicated to eliminating the smuggling of contraband, stolen merchandise, and tax-free imports, as well as the exporting of [[Isle of Kortos|Kortosian]] [[Artifact|artifacts]] that fall outside Absalom's enforceable jurisdiction. Terms of office are generally long, thus members with higher levels of responsibility often give up their primary business ventures and settle in Diobel for lives of public service. Despite the Consortium's best efforts, smuggling still occurs, and illicit merchandise travels in both directions overland to and from the city of Absalom. Because of the commercial repercussions of controlling Diobel's harbor, ambitious factions looking to gain influence in the City at the Center of the World are often first seen targeting Diobel. This political and economic jockeying creates a somewhat chaotic atmosphere in Diobel, one which threatens to collapse at any moment.


## Inhabitants

*See also: [[CategoryDiobelInhabitants]]*
> Many of the trapper families around Diobel are of [[Kellid]] descent, and speak [[Human languages of GolarionHallit|Hallit]] rather than [[Taldane]]. Some of these "inlanders" visit Diobel only once or twice a year, and are trusted little more than the [[Minotaur|minotaurs]] or [[Harpy|harpies]] of the island's interior.


### Notable residents

> - [[Elvi Kaldroon]]: a middle-aged [[Human|human]] woman, who protects the Kaldroon family against any who might threaten it.

> - [[Palraxi Locosta]]: a middle-aged female [[Tiefling|tiefling]] [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]] of supposed [[Taldan]] (but likely [[Cheliax|Chelish]]) aristocratic stock, leader of House Locosta.
> - [[Alvalda Margruel]]: a powerful noblewoman nearing her 50th year, Alvalda is the statuesque matriarch of [[House Margruel]].
> - [[Osprey]]: a prominent [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] who is a member the [[Pathfinder Society]], is thought to have been born in Diobel.
> - [[Lyrel Rambas|Prince Lyrel Rambas]]: the "prince" leads a crew of thugs and murderers in the Kortos Consortium and gains his wealth on the high seas. Rambas and his crew are in a secret battle with the Barge Gang.
