> **Mimere** is a small town on the eastern bank of the [[Sellen River]] in the forest [[River Kingdoms|river kingdom]] of [[Hymbria]]. It serves as a trading outpost and boasts a sturdy dock, many small shops, a clean and comfortable inn, and a lively alehouse. [[Pirate|River pirates]] seldom attack the peaceful village, because they have learned that at the smallest threat to the settlement, countless [[Elf|elven]] warriors descend from the trees, leaving only a few survivors to tell the story. The village has shrines to [[Calistria]], [[Desna]], [[Gozreh]], and [[Nethys]].
> Hymbrian elves get along well with their visitors, as long as they stay in the trading outposts. Only elves are permitted beneath the trees of the [[Northern Hymbrian Forest]]; others are slain on sight.
