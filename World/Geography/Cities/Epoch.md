> The strange city of **Epoch** on the [[Planet|planet]] [[Aballon]] is the most impressive of all the cities of the machines known as [[Aballonian|Aballonians]]. It is the de facto capital of the faction known as [[Those Who Become]], and the site of their most ambitious projectâ€”an attempt to create an [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] of godlike proportions.
> Epoch is build on a strict grid system, with boxy buildings and huge circuit fields surrounded by solar cells and processors. Countless machines labour to maintain and expand the city, for it is also their godâ€”the incredible machine intelligence also known as [[Epoch entity|Epoch]].
> Just when the Aballonians thought they had succeeded at their task, Epoch stopped communicating with them, retreating into strange riddles or koans undecipherable to their limited machine intelligence. They nevertheless continue maintaining the city and their god in the hopes that they may some day be able to decipher its ramblings.
