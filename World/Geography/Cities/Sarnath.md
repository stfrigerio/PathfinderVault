> **Sarnath** was a city established by [[Human|humans]] on the shore of a deep, nameless lake in the land of Mnar in the [[Dreamlands]], near the ancient city of Ib. Soon after its foundation, the proud, warlike people of Sarnath, disgusted by the [[Being of Ib|beings of Ibs]] strange appearance and terrifying [[Deity|deity]] [[Bokrug]], razed the city and slaughtered its inhabitants, and every year after that, the people of Sarnath would celebrate the anniversary of Ib's destruction. On the one-thousandth such festival, Bokrug and the [[Undead|undead]] beings of Ib rose from the lake, took their revenge and brought doom to Sarnath, erasing it from existence and leaving behind naught but a muddy plain.
