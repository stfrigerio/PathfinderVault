> **Fort Inevitable** is a small town just off the [[Crusader Road]], sandwiched between the [[West Sellen River]] and the [[Echo Wood]]. It is ruled by members of the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Pike]], but is otherwise unclaimed by any of the other political entities of the [[River Kingdoms]].


## Geography

> Fort Inevitable is located on rolling plains within sight of the southwestern Echo Wood, in the middle of rich farm country. It is surrounded by a strong, stone wall interrupted by defensive towers as well as a larger fortification known as the [[Commander's Citadel|Commanders Citadel]]. It sits on [[Misty Lake]], a small body fed by an unnamed stream that trickles out of the Echo Wood. Within the walls, most of the buildings are two- or three-story affairs with blue- or red-tiled roofs. The few streets are paved with cobblestones and cleaned regularly.


## Government

> The town is ruled with an iron fist by [[Audara Drovust|Lady Commander Audara Drovust]], a [[Paralictor|paralictor]] of the Hellknight Order of the Pike. She has both complete civil and military authority, and makes nearly every important decision in the town. The Paralictor also carries the titles of high magistrate, tax assessor, director of public works, keeper of the treasury, and chief regulator of business and commerce. In such a freedom-loving place as the River Kingdoms, one might expect that the citizens of the town would chafe under the Hellknights' draconian rule. Instead, they seem to tolerate the Commander's heavy-handed method, preferring it to the risk and lawlessness of other nearby towns such as [[Thornkeep]].
