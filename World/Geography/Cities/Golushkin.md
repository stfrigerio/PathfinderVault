> **Golushkin** is a [[Dwarven|dwarven]] settlement located in the [[Golushkin Mountains]]. The [[Golka]] family leads the clan. These dwarves had a trade relationship with [[House Garess]] of [[Brevoy]], but all contact has been lost from roughly the same time as the [[Vanishing]] of Brevoy's [[House Rogarvia]].
