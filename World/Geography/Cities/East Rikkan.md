> The small port towns of **East Rikkan** and [[Westpool]] lying to the north of [[Westcrown]] are known collectively as the [[Rikkan Ports]]. These settlements house large numbers of merchants dealing in the trade of goods up and down the [[River Adivian]], as well the numerous [[Slavery|slaves]] required to operate the [[Stavian Arches]] and portage stations. Although [[Westpool]] is larger, East Rikkan has more docks for fishermen and travelers.
