> **Eran's Rest** is a remote but picturesque settlement within the [[Hungry Mountains]], perched on the eastern side of the [[Ghorcha Pass]] among the [[Hundred Haunted Vales]] and overlooking the [[Adghain Valley]]. It lies in the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Amaans]], and access to the village is via a steep [[Goat|goat]] path.
> The village is dominated by herders and weavers but is also associated with fairy tales and other stories of badly-behaved [[Fey|fey]]. The villagers portray these tales in their [[Art|art]] and architecture as well as their stories. Unfortunately, there may be more to the tales than mere story as the village suffers regular disappearances and other strange events.
