> **The Faerie City of Nithveil** is a legendary town that appears on the [[Moon Golarion|new moon]] at random points within the [[Grungir Forest]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], spending the rest of the month in the [[First World]]. Those who complete the confusing and torturous path to Nithveil encounter sights unseen anywhere else on [[Golarion]].


## Geography

> Like much of the First World, Nithveil is hard to map, and its streets and buildings constantly rearrange themselves. Its narrow, twisting alleys separate buildings with strange and contorted architecture.


## Inhabitants

> Nithveil is home to an unusual assortment of creatures ranging from talking [[Animal|animals]], nature spirits, [[Fey|fey]], [[Troll|trolls]] with unusual magical powers to a few [[Human|human]] former residents of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings.
