> **Feldgrau** was a village in the [[Furcina]] area of the county of [[Ardeal]] in [[Ustalav]] lying close to the source of the [[Millrun River]]. Today it lies silent and ruined in the middle of the blasted wasteland called [[The Furrows|the Furrows]]. During the [[War Without Rivals]], the people of Feldgrau were slaughtered and their bodies dumped into a mass grave. However, the memories of the dead still linger in and haunt the place.
