> **Oe-Tet** is a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] settlement in the [[Brazen Frontier]] area of [[Osirion]]. The [[Pahmet]] dwarves created this settlement to facilitate trade, without allowing foreigners into their other settlements. Traders are grudgingly let into the settlement, provided they do not stray too far from the bazaar and inns.
