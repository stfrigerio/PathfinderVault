> **Jaha** is a great crumbling city in the northern part of the [[Mwangi Jungle]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].



## Geography

> No roads lead to the city, but it is accessible by the [[Olongo River]], and its white granite walls extend above the tree-line and are visible for miles.


## History

> It is said that the city was created in the ancient pastâ€”pre-[[Earthfall]], and perhaps before the arrival of [[Elf|elves]]â€”by unknown builders of great height. Stairs are steep, and doorways are tall and narrow. The city is built upon three main terraces, and many smaller terraces. The buildings are weathered and crumbling, but ancient protective magic keeps them essentially sound.


### Recent history

> It is currently ruled by a group of mad [[Lergeni astrology|astrologer-remnants]] of the [[Lirgeni human ethnicity|Lirgeni]], who arrived in the city as refugees after their homeland [[Lirgen]] was destroyed by storms and flooding caused by the [[Eye of Abendego]]. Jaha features heavily in Lirgen prophecy. The refugees defeated the city's primitive [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] inhabitants, and set about reclaiming the ruins from the jungle. This process is still ongoing; much of the city remains covered in plant life and occupied by jungle creatures. There is also a warren of tunnels and tombs beneath the city, which the lizardfolk feared to enter. Some claim these are the last resting places of the city's original builders.
> At the center of the city is a huge domed temple. The Lirgeni have made this the focal point of their ongoing [[Astrological|astrological]] activities. They do not welcome visitors, and those who have stayed in Jaha complain of poor nights' sleep and bizarre dreams of star-cracked space and sharp-edged spheres. Some say these dreams come directly from the city's ancient builders.
> The Lirgeni have recently started erecting dozens of enormous stones for some unknown purpose throughout the city. They might be connected to a plan to excavate the tunnels below.


## Relations

> Jaha's people regularly attempt to invade and steal knowledge from the isolated intellectual haven of [[Saruhk]] to the west, but otherwise are so insular that any knowledge to be gleaned about its people's activities must be gained through subterfuge.
