> **Fort Liberthane** is the only settlement in the tiny [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Liberthane]] founded by the revolutionary "Young Knight" [[Achille Parsall]] in [[4689 AR]]. The small fortress was the base of operations of a notorious bandit before Parsall and his followers seized control of it. The fort is home to approximately 50 soldiers. A number of farming families have settled around the fort.
