> The cathedral-like, [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] fortress of **Valorforge** at the [[Gap of Valballus]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]] was one of the fortresses of the defensive barrier of [[Sunwall]]. When the Sunwall fell in [[4237 AR]] the veteran soldiers of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] retreated to a second line of defense but the Ustalavs of Valorforge didn't abandon their fortress in the face of invincible [[Orc|orc]] hordes and all within were slaughtered. Now known as **Valorfoe**, the abandoned castle is shunned by the orcs due to the shadowy terrors that lurk within.
