> The city of **Taggoret** was the center of the [[Taggoret|Everlasting Kingdom of Taggoret]]: one of the five [[Dwarf|dwarven]] kingdoms in the [[Five Kings Mountains]], founded in [[1562 AR]] by [[Taggrick I]].
> Nowadays Taggoret is a thriving city with iron gates and stone walls on the surface and refined great caverns within the mountain. It is located at the north end of the long trail of dwarven tunnels that run beneath the Five Kings Mountains. Its main industry is iron mining and smelting. Taggoret's iron is known as the finest in [[Druma]] and [[Andoran]].
