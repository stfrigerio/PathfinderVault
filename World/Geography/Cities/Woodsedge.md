> The home of one of the fathers of the revolution, [[Darl Jubannich]] (who wrote the damning book *[[On Government]]* that helped start the [[Red Revolution]]), **Woodsedge** has always served as the traditional home for dissident thought and radical philosophies in [[Galt]]. Even with the country in its current state, nothing has changed. No matter who is currently in power, one can almost guarantee that the opposition to them will begin in Woodsedge, and any visitor is almost certain to find some sort of dissident movement afoot.


## Population

> Woodsedge is a destination for disgraced senators, ousted nobles, and simple outlaws that would not be tolerated in other Galtan cities.


## Places of interest

> The looted [[Woodsedge Lodge]] was once an important locale for the [[Pathfinder Society]], but was heavily damaged in riots in the early years of the revolution. [[Venture-Captain]] [[Eliza Petulengro]] has recently returned from [[Absalom]] to her homeland of Galt in an attempt to reclaim the building for her organisation, but her presence is barely tolerated by the locals.
> Like most other Galtan settlements, Woodsedge has a *[[Nethys/Artifacts/Final Blade|final blade]]* in its city square.
