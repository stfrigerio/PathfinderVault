*For another meaning of "Canorate", please see Canorate (province).*
> **Canorate** is the capital of the nation of [[Molthune]]. It is an impressive city which manages to combine [[Architectural|architectural]] splendor with defensive fortifications. It is said that even the poor of Canorate live in luxury, and to a certain extent this is trueâ€”citizens allow a select number of necessary laborers to live in fine accommodation (but naturally kept separate from the rest of the population) in order to encourage them to settle in the city.
> The city's most exclusive district is known as the [[Sweet Orchard]]. Non-residents are not allowed to enter this exclusive section without a valid work or travel permit.
> The [[Imperial Castle]] dominates the center of the city. The ruler of Molthune, [[Markwin Teldas|Imperial Governor Markwin Teldas]], maintains an impressive war room within the castle. Pride of place is given to a large scale model of the [[Inner Sea region]], on which the [[General Lords|generals]] plot their next campaigns.


## Inhabitants


### Halflings

> In addition to the [[Human|humans]] who make up the majority of the city's people, Canorate has one of the largest populations of [[Halfling|halflings]] in the Inner Sea region. These halflings are famous for their skilled sculptors and artisans able to work at great heights on Molthune's buildings, creating works of great beauty. Local nobles often employ halfling [[Art|artists]] for such works.
