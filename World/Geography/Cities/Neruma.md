> Unusually for the [[Shackles]], the city of **Neruma** is not on the coast. It is one of the few major settlements on the [[Port Peril and the Mainland|mainland]], and is situated in the north-east, along the [[Terwa River]] and close to the borders with the [[Mwangi Expanse]] and the [[Sodden Lands]]. Neruma is a centre for trade between the Shackles and those two neighbouring regions. The main trading items purchased here are [[Slaves|slaves]], but other items of value also occasionally make their way along the river to Neruma.
> The city's current ruler is [[Cousotta Shald]]. She is assisted by the [[Steel Cordage]], a group of mercenaries supplied by the [[Shackles]]' ruling [[Pirate Council]].
> The city is built on [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] breeding grounds (although the townsfolk are unaware of this), and is subject to regular attacks by lizardfolk seeking to reclaim their lost territory.
