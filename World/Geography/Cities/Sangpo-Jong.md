> Cut into the side of a mountain, **Sangpo-Jong** is the nominal capital of [[Zi Ha]] in [[Tian Xia]] and an isolationist city dominated by [[Samsaran|samsarans]]. Most outsiders are forbidden from the city, but for those who can enter, Sangpo-Jong is full of scenic wonders and epic stone carvings.


## Geography

> Sangpo-Jong is located on a high mountain and accessible via a narrow, winding staircase. The stairs are painted with [[Imperial dragon|imperial dragons]], from [[Underworld dragon|underworld dragons]] at the bottom to [[Sky dragon|sky dragons]] at the top, reflecting the samsarans' ascension from cave dwellers to enlightened, spiritual people. Sangpo-Jong features monasteries, temples, shrines, gardens, plazas, theatres, and schools.


## Government

> The appointed ruler of Sangpo-Jong (and Zi Ha as a whole) is [[Gyaltho Tulku]], who dwells in the temple of [[Qi Zhong]].
