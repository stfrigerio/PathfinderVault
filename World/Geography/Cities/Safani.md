> The settlement of **Safani** is a small town near the [[Crook River]], in [[Osirion]]. Its leader is [[Efni Raan]].
> Safani is too far from major cities to receive the benefit of their protection against [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]] raiders, so the town's residents came up with a unique defense strategy. The town is fully camouflaged: the buildings are built into the hills and covered in sod. Other vegetation has been carefully cultivated so it can cover more conspicuous aspects of the buildings, like doors and windows.
