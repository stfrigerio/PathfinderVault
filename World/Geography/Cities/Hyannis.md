> **Hyannis** is an [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] coal-mining settlement in the county of [[Versex]]; the forlorn shacks of the villagers are set on the edge of the [[Hungry Mountains]] near to the source of the [[Danver River]]. The village and the mines are still haunted by the greenish [[Spectre|spectre]] of the [[Witch|witch]] called Black Aggie, whom the villagers rose up against nearly forty years ago; they ripped the monster to pieces then burnt her before casting her remains into an abandoned mine. Worse than the hauntings, though, are the miners who become possessed by what is considered Black Aggie's suffocating breath.
