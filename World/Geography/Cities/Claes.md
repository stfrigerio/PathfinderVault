> The [[Andoran|Andoren]] fishing village of **Claes** is located on the [[Inner Sea]] coast, just over 50 miles south of the [[Andoshen River]] delta. A humble town, the inhabitants make their living from the ample harvest of the sea, supplementing it with some subsistence farming. When [[Pirate|pirates]] or [[Slavery|slavers]] attack, the people of Claes retreat to an ancient, underground [[Azlant|Azlanti]] fortress known as the Claes Redoubt; the ruin is known to be quite deep.
> [[Reginald Cormoth|General Reginald Cormoth]], commander of Andoran's [[Eagle Knights]], was born in Claes.
