> The [[Nex|Nexian]] city of **Oenopion** (pronounced oh-NOH-pee-ohn) is known as a center for [[Alchemy|alchemical]] production. Here they brew [[Potion|potions]] and elixirs which factor heavily in Nex's economy. The [[Homunculus|homunculi]] they create have a reputation for cunning and dependability, and the city also has a well-known golemworks. Within laboratories, [[Wizard|mages]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemists]] also work together in their perfection of the so-called art of [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]].
> The central lake is the site of a massive [[Ooze|ooze]] colony that has developed a hivemind. As well as being a useful means of disposing of unwanted items and people, the ooze has proved to be useful in [[Magic/Divination|divination]] magic.
> Oenopion is represented on Nex's ruling body, the [[Council of Three and Nine]], by master alchemist [[Borume]].


## Organizations

> The [[Oenopion Fleshforges]] guild constructs strange new soldiers in its experimental [[Laboratory|laboratories]].
