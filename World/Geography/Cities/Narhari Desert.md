> The **Narhari Desert** can be found in distant [[Vudra]] on the continent of [[Casmaron]]. It is said to be claimed by the three-eyed [[Dragon|dragon]] [[Trilochan]], the cleverest of the [[Spawn of Rovagug]].



## Geography

> The most desolate of Vudra's regions, the Narhari Desert contains some of the most rugged [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapadas]] in all Vudra. What little water there is comes from the fast flowing [[Bahig River]]. The Narhari desert is flanked by two mountain ranges, to the north-east lie the [[Johar Mountains]] while to the west lie the [[Pardaparbat Mountains]]. Amongst the Pardaparbat Mountains a large number of [[Linnorm|linnorms]] and corrupted [[Dragon|dragons]] fight for control of the valley known as [[Viritash's Tail|Viritashs Tail]]. Named for the [[Evil|evil]] dragon [[Deity|god]] [[Viritash]], Viritash's Tail is home to a scepter made from his tail that promises great power to whichever of his draconic successors can claim it.


## Settlements

> Despite its generally desolate nature, the Narhari Desert is home to a wide range of different settlements. Where the Bahig River disappears into a massive sinkhole at the heart of the Narhari Desert sits the outlaw city of [[Gadbadigat]]. To the south of the region at the edge of the Pardaparbat Mountains sit the two towns of [[Adhaarm]] and [[Vinpinna]], each controlled by a different sect of [[Undead|undead]] martial artists. The largest [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapada]] of the region is [[Japrini]] and its capital of [[Jastinpur]] is a beautiful metropolis.


## Inhabitants

***Main article: [[Vudrani-Banjarey]]***
> The nomadic, [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|equestrian]] Banjarey people travel the Narhari Desert as proud, independent families unsworn to any mahajanapada.


### Rudrakavala

> An extremely powerful [[Devourer|devourer]] named [[Rudrakavala]] is believed to dwell in a remote mountain valley in the Narhari. He is served by a fanatical cult of emaciated worshipers, who bring him victims, but with whom he does not communicate.
