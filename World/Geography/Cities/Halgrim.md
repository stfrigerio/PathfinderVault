> The city of **Halgrim** is the second largest settlement in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]; only [[Kalsgard]] is bigger. Located on the northwestern shore of [[PathfinderWiki/Battlewall]], one of the largest islands in the [[Ironbound Archipelago]], Halgrim was founded by [[Igarven|King Igarven]] in [[2655 AR]]. Today, it is ruled by the [[Linnorm King]] [[White Estrid]] from her palace. The [[Rustflow River]] flows out to the sea through Halgrim and, famously, seven bridges cross the river within the city. The city's defenses are greatly enhanced by the constant presence of White Astrid's [[Linnorm|linnorm]] thrall, [[Boiltongue]].


## History

> [[Cheliax|Imperial Cheliax]] attempted an invasion of Halgrim in [[4402 AR]], but the attacks are quickly repelled by local inhabitants. The single Chelish ship of survivors was sent back home with the pickled heads of their compatriots to serve as a lesson to the King.
