## People

> Oda is the city in Minkai with the highest amount of immigrants from other [[Tian Xia]] countries, mostly farmhands recruited by rich landowners and merchants, artisans, and restaurateurs who seek to support their communities back home. Organised crime is influential in Oda: bandits preying upon people headed to the city, yakuza running secret rackets, and [[Pirate|pirates]] watching for lightly defended merchant [[Ship|ships]] sailing too near [[Aogaito Island]].
