> **Shirogoku** is a great spiral-shaped city located in [[Sekamina]] beneath the [[Forest of Spirits]] and northern [[Minkai]]. A twisted mockery of the surface, Shirogoku's pallid [[Oni|oni]] rulers breed their [[Human|human]] [[Slavery|slaves]] like [[Cattle|cattle]].


## History

> In [[470 AR]], the [[Teikoku|Teikoku Shogunate]] general, [[Ishanda Aiko]], led an expedition from [[Mount Kumijinja]] in the [[Kamifushi Mountains]] along the [[Ghost Path]] that eventually reached Shirogoku. There were almost no survivors and a battered Ishanda returned along the Ghost Path to the Shogunate to warn them of what she had found.
