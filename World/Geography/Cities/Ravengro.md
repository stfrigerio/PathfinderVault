> The [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] settlement of **Ravengro** is located in the west of the county of [[Canterwall]], close to the contentious border with the [[Hold of Belkzen]].



## Geography

> A small river, the **Ravengro Creek**, runs through the town, while an even smaller rivulet meets the Ravengro Creek just north of the southernmost bridge in the town. There are three bridges in the town: two span the Creek, one to the north and one to the south, while a third small wooden bridge runs over the rivulet.
> To the north of the town lies the huge water of [[Lake Lias]], locally called 'The Great Blue Dot'. To the south of the town is a hill upon which stands the ruins of the [[Harrowstone]] prison looming over the town.


## History


### Founding

> Ravengro was founded in [[4594 AR]] as a town for the people who worked at or supported the infamous [[Harrowstone]] prison and their families. At that time the county of [[Canterwall]] did not exist and Ravengro lay in the county of [[Tamrivena]], ruled by the unpopular Count [[Eigen Lorres]]; it was the Count's idea to build a large prison at Ravengro that could house, for a fee, criminals from anywhere in Ustalav. This plan did indeed increase Lorres' popularity as other parts of Ustalav moved their prisoners to Harrowstone and money started to flow into the county in return.
> In [[4661 AR]], a prisoner uprising led to Harrowstone prison being burnt down and all the prisoners and many of the staff, including the warden and his wife, were killed. The prison was never rebuilt and shortly thereafter, in [[4670 AR]], a bloodless coup occurred in Tamrivena bringing a new democracy to the county and to Ravengro. Many political historians see the fire at Harrowstone and its immediate neglect as one of the catalysts of the move to democracy in the county.


### Contemporary Ravengro

> Today, Ravengro is an idyllic self-sufficient Ustalav town supporting a local farming community, and a smaller fishing community. The town predominantly produces wheat, barley and maize, with some fish from Lake Lias supplementing the local diet.


## Government

> The [[Ravengro Council]], or Ravengro Town Council, is the governing body responsible for the general government of the town; it comprises four local councillors.
