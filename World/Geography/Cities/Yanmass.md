> **Yanmass** is a [[Taldor|Taldan]] city that stands along one of the trade routes that flow across the deserts of the [[Casmaron]] linking it with the heartland of the [[Empire of Kelesh]] and, from there, with lands even further away. Unsurprisingly, Yanmass is a city based on trade and providing vital services to caravans after their long treks across the continent; Yanmass plays host to caravans from across the known world.


## Population

> Inside the walls on Yanmass, the population live in solid buildings, while a thriving community of traders often live outside the city proper. Depending on the time of year, the population of the city can triple, especially towards the end of summer.


## Military

> The [[Taldan Horse]] are stationed at Yanmass, and regularly patrol the [[Whistling Plain]] from the settlement.
