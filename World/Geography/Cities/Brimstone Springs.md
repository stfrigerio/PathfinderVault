> **Brimstone Springs** is a small settlement high in the [[Mindspin Mountains]] of [[Nidal]] known for its hot springs: the [[Soulsheen Baths]]. Hundreds of people from all over the region come every year to soak in its sulfur-rich mineral waters that fall in natural cascades, giving the town a rather unpleasant smell. These waters then collect to form the source of the [[Sulfur River]], which flows westward out of the mountains toward [[Usk Lake]]. Brimstone Springs has also gained a certain amount of notoriety from the golden dream, a special, day-long immersion in poisonous waters that, if it doesn't kill the user, gives him or her visions of the afterlife while permanently dying the skin a deep yellow.
