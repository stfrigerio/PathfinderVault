> **Indapatta** is the breathtakingly beautiful capital of the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]] that was founded by the first Maharajah [[Khiben-Sald]]. The city is located within the [[Golden Basin]] region of Vudra on the north-eastern banks of [[Sona Lake]].


## City design

> The sprawling palace of the Maharajah (currently [[Rajeshwar|Maharajah Rajeshwar]]) sits at the very centre of the city. From this incredible complex, the rest of the city sprawls out like a lotus, its districts following the harmonic natural design of the lotus flower. Within Indapatta's walls are countless gardens, bazaars, palaces, courts, and menageries that, in the event of an invasion, could be sealed, like the petals of a lotus, and turn the wondrous city into an impenetrable defensive bastion.
