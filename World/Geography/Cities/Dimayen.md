> **Dimayen** is a sizable farming settlement located in southern [[Qadira]] in the [[Meraz Desert]] south of the [[Meraz River]].


## History

> Once a large and profitable farming community, Dimayen has suffered in recent times due to crop failure, the collapse of their irrigation system, and unseasonable dust storms. Although the town is still surviving, the loss of crops has crippled local trade and the city itself is slowly being abandoned by its inhabitants. Half of the buildings and farmsteads are being buried by the encroaching desert, and starvation is a looming threat.


## Inhabitants

> The inhabitants are proud however, and most are stubborn enough to stay through what they believe to be, "a spate of bad luck". Even so, the town elders have become increasingly concerned at signs of [[Ankheg|ankheg]] infestation and have begun taking precautions against the growing menace. They currently seek advice from sages as to how to drive these beasts off the farmlands, which will allow them to rebuild the collapsed irrigation canals and salvage some hope for the people.
