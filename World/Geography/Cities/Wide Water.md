> **Wide Water** is one of the most fertile regions in all the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]]. Wide Water roughly follows the length of the [[Matra River]] as it winds from its head waters in the [[Johar Mountains]] near the city of [[Ukhrul]] all the way to the [[Embaral Ocean]]. While flooding is common along the entire length of the Matra River, it is expected and normally rejuvenates the land rather than devastating it. The [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapadas]] along the Matra are not just rich in food but also others commodities like clay, pottery, and textiles, harvested from the river's rich natural bounty.
> To the north-west of Wide Water, at the head of the Matra River, the city of Ukhrul boasts a mighty military force and an expansionist ruler, [[Shavit|Rajah Shavit]]. Further east, sits the holy city of [[Valishava]], renowned for its numerous temples and known for its high priest [[Razdara]]: she and her acolytes regularly travel the [[Plane|planes]] searching for spiritual wisdom. Further down the river lies [[Radripal]], City of Arches, and capital of the [[Danamsa]] mahajanapada and ruled by the secret [[Rakshasa|rakshasa]] Rajah Akashar. Finally, near the mouth of the Matra River sits [[Lipror]], the so called City of Lotuses.
