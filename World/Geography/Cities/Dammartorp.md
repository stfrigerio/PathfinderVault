> **Dammartorp** is a small settlement on the [[Marbleflow River]] in [[Irrisen|Irrisens]] [[Hoarwood province]]. It is jointly ruled by the [[Jadwiga|Jadwigas]] Tereza and Tsviata, twin sisters locked in a struggle for control of the town.
> The peasantry are divided between the two baronesses and they even frequent different markets and taverns and spit on the ground when passing one another. The peasant followers of Lady Tereza are led by [[Viglund Lyubienko]], who is also the owner of the [[Tavern on the Water]], while those who favor Lady Tsviata are led by the prominent wool seller Zora Oblatov.
> Bandits infest the trade route between Dammartorp and [[Hoarwood]] but the baronesses are too engaged in their quarrel to address the problem.
