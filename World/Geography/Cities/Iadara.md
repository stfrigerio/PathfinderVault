> The illusion-shrouded city of **Iadara** (pronounced eye-uh-DAR-ah) is the beautiful capital of the [[Elf|elven]] kingdom of [[Kyonin]].



## Geography

> Although the city is intentionally hidden and obscured via [[Illusion|illusion]] and magical fog, the elven capital is an awe-inspiring combination of elven [[Magic|magic]] and architecture with the natural environment of the [[Fierani Forest]]. Indeed, most buildings are artfully intertwined with the twisting trees, designed to protect and augment both. The structures are mostly constructed from silver, crystal, and wood, and smooth, twisting towers are popular architectural motifs. Music, laughter, and birdsong are the first sounds visitors hear when they approach Iadara.
> Iadara sits on the banks of the [[Endowhar River]]; shortly downstream of the city, the Endowhar is joined by the [[Kyonin River]], which eventually flows into the [[West Sellen River]].


## History

> In the past, magic was used purely to enhance the beauty of the city. As the nation has become more and more isolationist, however, magic is now used to obscure the true extent of the city via magical fog and twisting vines that cover the architecture. Since the arrival of [[Treerazer]] in Kyonin, the city has been under [[Demon|demonic]] threat.


## Government

> Iadara is home to the Kyonin monarchy and its ruling queen, [[Telandia Edasseril]], bearer of the [[Viridian Crown]].


## Places of interest

> The city houses the legendary [[Sovyrian Stone]], that powers the [[Elf gate|aiudara]] and connects [[Golarion]] with the distant elven refuge of [[Sovyrian]]. Most elves are aware of its existence, although its exact location is carefully hidden.


## Non-elf visitors

> Although non-elf visitors are exceptionally rare, they are never subjected to anything worse than curious stares from the elven inhabitants, provided they keep to their designated areas.
