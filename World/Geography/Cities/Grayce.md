> **Grayce** is an [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] settlement in the south-west of the county of [[Caliphas]] with the border of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], the [[Path River]], a mere stone's throw away. This proximity means the town is a bridge to Lastwall with the [[Chapel Bridge]], a drawbridge that can span the Path, literally fulfilling this role. From the southern end of the bridge, roads lead to [[Vigil]], north-west of Grayce, and to [[Vellumis]] to the south.
> The townsfolk are predominately farmers, shepherds, and weavers.


## Religion

> The people of Grayce are very devout and worship a narrow pantheon of mainly [[Goddess|goddesses]]: especially [[Iomedae]], [[Pharasma]], and the [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] [[Andoletta]]. The vitally important Chapel Bridge is so named as it is built through an ancient shrine to Pharasma.
