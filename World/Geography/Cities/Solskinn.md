> **Solskinn** is located to the south of the [[Grungir Forest]] and to the north-east of [[Jol]] (the capital of [[Southmoor]]) in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. Today, it is officially ruled by Southmoor's [[Linnorm King]] [[Opir Eightfingers]], but the local leaders will take control when they feel they can. Pleasant during the day, the small town is under forced curfew at night, as anyone leaving their homes gets abducted by the visiting shadows.
