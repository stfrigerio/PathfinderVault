> **Veshtak** is a small town on the [[Marbleflow River]] in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of [[Wintercrux]]. The town is in a strategic location where the merchants load their cargo onto ships traveling the river north.
> Veshtak won the right to govern itself a generation ago, using bribes and political connections. The town exploits its position, exacting high tariffs, soliciting bribes and demanding a share of the goods. The [[Cold Sisters]] keep an eye on the greedy [[Ulfen]] townsfolk of Veshtak. A number of former mayors, dock wardens, warehouse managers hang in cages in the town's main square.
> Veshtak's current mayor is the greedy [[Vidlof Haradsson]]. Few know that the dockworker [[Marina Gnetsky]] is actually Vidlof's boss. When the Cold Sisters come to town, Marina will make sure that Vidlof will be punished instead of her.
