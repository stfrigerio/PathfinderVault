![[Magnimar_panorama.jpg|right+hmed]] 



> The city of **Magnimar** (pronounced MAG-nih-mahr) stands as one of the two major city-states of southern [[Varisia]]. Founded by [[Korvosa|Korvosan]] dissenters in [[4608 AR]], the City of Monuments now stands as a rival to Korvosa in an open war of coin and words. The people of the city are termed 'Magnimarians' and they call Korvosa: 'Little Cheliax'.



## Geography

> Magnimar is a large city located on the southwestern coast of [[Varisia]] where the [[River Yondabakari|Yondabakari River]] empties into the [[Varisian Gulf]]. The city is surrounded by the mostly inhospitable [[Mushfens]]. The city itself is defined by two colossal landmarks which predate modern civilization by thousands of years or more. The [[Irespan]] is an ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] ruin, the easternmost end of a giant bridge which has now crumbled into the sea. This enormous relic stretched from Magnimar's other most noticeable feature, the three-hundred-foot tall cliff which cuts the city in two known as the [[Seacleft]].

#### City districts

> While these unavoidable monuments provide natural dividers to the city's three major districts (the [[Summit Magnimar district|Summit]] atop the cliff, the [[Shore Magnimar district|Shore]] below, and the [[Shadow Magnimar district|Shadow]] under the Irespan, residents recognize nine city districts within Magnimar.


##### The Summit

> The wealthiest communities in Magnimar are located in [[Summit Magnimar district|the Summit]] atop the rise of the Seacleft, as are the city's centers of government, education, and arts. The Summit contains the following three city districts:

> - [[Alabaster District]], incorporating the neighbourhoods of [[Marble District]] and the [[Stylobate]]
> - [[Capital District]], incorporating the neighbourhood of [[Bridgeward]]
> - [[Naos]], incorporating the neighbourhoods of [[Grand Arch]] and [[Vista]]

##### The Shore

> Home to the majority of Magnimar's working class, the Shore contains Magnimar's coasts and docks, and the following five city districts:

> - [[Beacon's Point|Beacons Point]], incorporating the neighbourhood of [[Rag's End|Rags End]]
> - [[Dockway]]
> - [[Keystone]], incorporating the neighbourhoods of [[The Marches]] and [[Silver Shore]]
> - [[Lowcleft]]
> - [[Ordellia]], incorporating [[Kyver's Islet|Kyvers Islet]]

##### The Shadow

> The Shadow district is the most derelict in the city and houses only the single city district of [[Underbridge]]. It is home to the seediest of Magnimar's inhabitants and most members of the government take an "out of sight, out of mind" approach to the district's problems.


#### Holdings

> Magnimar has begun to slowly expand her sphere of influence to encompass many nearby settlements and communities. These communities tend to be healthier than those of Magnimar's main rival Korvosa.

## Government

> Magnimar is ruled by two official political bodies: the [[Council of Ushers]] and the [[Office of the Lord-Mayor]]. This two-tiered system was established at the city's founding to ensure that no single person ever had too much control. Despite the idealist intentions of the city's founders, over the last century both offices have become more power-hungry and less effective at representing the needs of the city-state's citizens.

### Council of Ushers

***Main article: [[Council of Ushers]]***
> The Council of Ushers serves as the legislature of Magnimar and currently contains 117 members. Of these, many are nobles whose families have held seats for generations, back to the time when the Council was but fifteen members large. With many more seats now that there are noble families, dozens of seats are filled with scheming merchants and greedy power-seekers, as well as a frustrated number of genuinely altruistic activists and honest merchants all vying to have their personal causes (many of which are entirely self-serving) heard and passed into law. The Council meets in the austere [[Usher's Hall|Ushers Hall]] in [[Capital District]].


### Office of the Lord-Mayor

![[Sabriyya_Kalmeralm.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Sabriyya Kalmeralm|Lord-Mayor Sabriyya Kalmeralm]].
***Main article: [[Office of the Lord-Mayor]]***
> In theory restricted by the council of Ushers, the lord-mayor is by far the most powerful person in Magnimar. This immense power normally results in corruption. Many of Magnimar's political matters are determined not by who is right, or at least most persuasive, but by who brings the lord-mayor the most lavish and impressive bribe. While in theory the lord-mayor must uphold the mandates of the Council of Ushers, previous [[Haldmeer Grobaras|Lord-Mayor Haldmeer Grobaras]] frequently ignored them when they were not to his liking.
> The current lord-mayor is [[Sabriyya Kalmeralm]], who was elected to the post after Grobaras's mysterious death.


### Justice Court

***Main article: [[Justice Court]]***
> When legal arbitration is needed above and beyond what the city guard themselves can handle, the legal system of Magnimar calls upon the [[Justice Court]]. This body of 13 Justices is the highest court in the city state and rules on disagreements as well as the guilt or innocent of those accused of particularly heinous crimes. The Court meets in the [[Pediment Building]] which also serves as a prison for the city's most hardened criminals, located in a [[Dungeon|dungeon]] deep beneath the building called "*the Hells*."


## History

*For a brief timeline of the city, see [[Timeline of Magnimar]].*
> Magnimar is a very new city by the standards of the [[Inner Sea region]], having only been founded by disillusioned Korvosan settlers in [[4608 AR]].
> The [[Eyes of the Hawk|Eyes of the Hawk adventuring group]] famously defended Magnimar from [[Shriezyx|shriezyx]] freed from the [[Irespan]] in [[4623 AR]]. Several monuments in the city, including [[The Guardians]], [[Eyes of the Hawk monument]], and [[Grand Arch]] district, commemorate this event.

## Inhabitants

> Ethnic [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisians]] tend to encounter less prejudice in this majority [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelaxian]] city, although they do tend to be segregated to certain neighborhoods.

## Economy

> Compared to its sister city Korvosa, Magnimar tends to put few restrictions on trade and traders. It openly encourages the formation of trade guilds, and generally is a place where almost anyone (given good connections and a healthy amount of luck) can make something of him or herself. Because of these attitudes, even though Magnimar is still smaller than Korvosa in terms of both population and trade, it may soon grow to outstrip its neighbor.


## Religion

> Temples exist to [[Calistria]], [[Desna]], [[Erastil]], [[Iomedae]], [[Norgorber]], [[Pharasma]], and [[Sarenrae]]. Some [[Empyreal lord|Empyreal lords]] are worshiped, but not in formal temples. Private meeting places revere [[Arshea]], [[Ashava]], [[Ragathiel]], [[Sinashakti]], [[Soralyon]], and [[Ylimancha]].
