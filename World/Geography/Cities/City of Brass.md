> The fabled **City of Brass** is the capital of the Dominion of Flame, the nation of the [[Genie|genies]] known as the [[Efreet|efreet]], and is found on the [[Plane of Fire]]. The efreet themselves call the city **Fommok Madinah**. It is a city of majestic palaces, tall towers, and wide boulevards that provides some respite to visitors of this otherwise wholly inhospitable [[Plane|plane]]. Even though many efreet are happy to trade with others, their inherent racial prejudice means that most feel little compunction in taking advantage of, or even robbing and [[Slavery|enslaving]] outsiders who show weakness. Those visitors who can convince the efreet that they are not to be trifled with, or acquire an official status such as trader or diplomat, have access to the grandest markets that the Plane of Fire, and some even say the [[Great Beyond]], has to offer.



## Districts of the City

> The city is divided into eight quarters, excluding the [[Great Bazaar City of Brass|Great Bazaar]], and two major regions: the [[Inner Ward]] and the Outer Ward. The [[Inner Ward]] is a divided into a series of circle-like regions separated by rivers of molten lava. It consists of The Great Bazaar, the Temple Quarter, and the Noble Quarter. The Outer Ward is made up of dive sections divided by huge obsidian walls. Here are located the Burning Quarter, the Magesâ€™ Quarter, the Commonersâ€™ Quarter, the Slavesâ€™ Quarter, and the Galley Quarter.


### The Great Bazaar

> Referred to as the Suq al-Azzmir Marketplace by efreet, this bazaar is one of the largest trading hubs in the [[Great Beyond]]. One can find almost any good imaginable here, from the mundane, like metals and spices, to the magical. The principal stock of this great market, however, is the slave trade that flourishes here. Gold isn't the main currency that exchanges hands, that being instead magics which the efreet covet. The only items that are rare to see is anything related to water, which is strictly regulated and items that could be used in the binding of genies. This region is among the most diverse of the whole city consisting of many fire-immune creatures like efreet, [[Azer|azers]], [[Salamander|salamanders]], and [[Fire elemental|fire elementals]].


### The Temple Quarter

> Despite being largely lawless toward any deific power, the efreet nonetheless construct buildings honoring many powerful beings of flame including images of the grand sultan himself. As an effort to ingratiate themselves with [[Deity|divine beings]], this section of the city seems to constantly expand with new great temples as well as ancient treasures to fill them. Among the temples here you can find the palace of [[Ymeri]], the Elemental Queen of the Inferno, one of the most powerful beings on the whole Plane of Fire. Despite the grandeur of her temple and the semi-frequent visits, [[Ymeri|Ymeri Queen of the Inferno]], has visited the palace only a handful of times since its construction; doing so twice to wreak havoc on the efreet.


### The Noble Quarter

> The wealthiest of the cityâ€™s districts, the Noble Quarter is part of the innermost section of the [[Inner Ward]] with the heart of it being filled by the Grand Sultanaâ€™s palace. The Noble Quarter lies at the bottom of the basin that is the City of Brass, though its towers particularly the palace peak high above the city proper. Beneath these towers flow marvelous pools of raining sulfur and quicksilver, while haughty palanquins carried by armies of slaves crowd the streets. The Noble Quarter is where you can find the scheming genies plotting amongst sycophants and vying for the Grand Sultana's favor. It is in the heart of this district that the governance of this great nation takes place.


### Burning Quarter

> The Burning Quarter is a peculiar place within the City of Brass as its one of the few places you are unlikely to see an efreet. Instead this quarter is made up of many different [[Fire elemental]]. There is little architecture here and instead the primary focus of this district is a pillar of flame. Rumor holds that if ever there is a slave revolt the Fire Elementals here will simply rain down upon them incinerating them leaving nothing but ash behind.


### The Magesâ€™ Quarter

> The smallest quarter rests on a hill surrounded by powerful guardians and magics that act as a barrier to all outsiders. Here practitioners of the mystic arts hone their craft in attempts to bind elementals, mortals and even other genies. Two sorcerers stand out, Grand Vizier [[Abdul-Qawi]] and White Mage [[Yndri Ysalaa]] the former being one of the major political powers in the City of Brass and the later being possibly the most powerful sorcerer in the City. It is said that Yndri Ysalaa is the power behind the wards that protect the district.
