> **Ilsurian** is a small agricultural and fishing town situated on the northern banks of [[Lake Syrantula]] at the mouth of the [[Skull River]]. The town is on the [[Yondabakari Road]], 64 miles northeast of [[Whistledown]] (and a total of 359 miles east of the city of [[Magnimar]]). The Yondabakari Road continues towards the town of [[Biston]], 45 miles to the east.



## History

> Ilsurian was founded in [[4631 AR]] by [[Ilsur]], a former [[First Sword]] of the [[Knights of Aroden]], and his followers, all of whom were dissatisfied with the direction [[Korvosa]] took following the collapse of the [[Cheliax|Chelish Empire]]. The original plan was to await the right time to return to Korvosa and overthrow the new aristocracy, replacing the monarchy with a military meritocracy.  That time never came, and the citizens of Ilsurian have contented themselves with their lives as fishermen and woodsmen.  That said, they are still required to maintain a sharp [[Sword|sword]] and train for defending against an invasion, as their sense of independence and freedom has not dwindled in the last century. The town has recently become a stopping place for the [[Umbra Carnival]].


## Government

> Ilsurian is ruled by a six-person [[Town Council Ilsurian|council]] democratically elected every two years. The council adjudicates laws and settles disputes in the town. The residents take great pride in their civic duties and almost every citizen participates in the elections. Being a meritocracy, the citizens are instructed to vote based more on the quality and experience of the candidates than their stances on issues. In its meritocratic system, only former council members can nominate new candidates. The council heads, too, are chosen by the rest of the council, and serve for two years. The laws do not allow council heads to be voted in for successive 2-year terms, except in rare emergency situations.


## Inhabitants

> The sheriff is a [[Human|human]] named Kyra Feldane.
