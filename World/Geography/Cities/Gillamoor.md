> **Gillamoor** is a village in [[Isger]] on the edge of the [[Chitterwood]]. It managed to survive the destruction of the [[Goblinblood Wars]] but has now fallen to what is being called the Gillamoor Plague.
> According to the usually fearless caravan guards of the [[Mercenary League]], many of the villagers have been transformed into ravenous disease-carrying [[Zombie|zombies]]. The village is under quarantine by order of the Isgeri army, and its leaders secretly hope that the [[Hedvend VI|stewards]] 5,000 gold piece reward for eliminating the [[Undead|undead]] plague will convince outsiders to cleanse the town for them. A few of the village's inhabitants are still believed to be alive, trying to last out the siege in heavily barricaded homes.
