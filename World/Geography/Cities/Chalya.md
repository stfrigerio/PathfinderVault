> **Chalya** is a city located in the [[Falling Mountains]] region of the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]]. Chalya is the most easily accessible city (by land) for those visiting the Falling Mountains region from the rest of Vudra. It sits within the [[Lohaparbat Mountains]] and is home to numerous pagodas and ashrams that draw visitors not just from the neighbouring region of [[The Cradle]] but from all across Vudra.
