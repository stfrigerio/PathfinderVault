> **Kiutu** is a small village in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] near [[Terwa Lake]]. Most of the locals make a steady living through fishing, though the town gets most of its money from building [[Ship|boats]] instead. [[Bonuwat]] tradition and M'beke innovation have come together over the generations to create some of the most in-demand boats in the whole region. Kiutu is also known for producing a surprising amount of artisans who go out to explore and adventure, though they are sure to send money and other gifts back to their families.
