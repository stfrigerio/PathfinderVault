> **Graymoor** is a relatively peaceful town in [[Sovereign's Reach|Sovereigns Reach]], a region of [[Numeria]] known more for its history of war and technological horrors. Graymoor is one of the few places on [[Golarion]] where [[Android|androids]] are welcomed and can live alongside the locals peaceably.


## Government

> The town is ruled by [[Berym Verrachus|Lord Cheldain Graymoor]], whose family emigrated from [[Ustalav]] more than 100 years ago. The Graymoor family brought significant wealth with them, and applied it to build an incongruously gothic castle in the Ustalavic style and improve the lands and people around it, allowing the town of Graymoor to thrive.
> Lord Graymoor himself maintains a degree of independence; he rebuffs the [[Technic League]] while paying its taxes. His longevity, reclusiveness, and lack of aging leads to rumors that he is a [[Vampire|vampire]], though he deals with others openly in daytime.
