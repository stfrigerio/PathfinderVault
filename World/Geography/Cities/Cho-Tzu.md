> **Cho-Tzu** is the main settlement on the [[Shenchu Bay]] island in the [[Shackles]]. It is built around a large triangular harbor.
> Most of the harbor is used by the Shenchu [[Pirate|pirate]] vessels and the merchants [[Ship|ships]]. A second city is formed in the remaining part of the harbor consisting of 50 or more [[Ship|junks]], rafts, and other ramshackle watercraft occupied by over 200 [[Tian-Sing|Tian-Sings]], descended from sailors from [[Zo Piaobo]], the floating city of [[Minata]]. These folk rarely set foot on dry land and are known to provide services from fortune-telling to midwifery but can also be hired as thugs. Most of the inhabitants of Cho-Tzu are Tian-Sings but the ramshackle neighborhoods on the northernmost side of the city are populated by [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengus]] who escaped from [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]] long ago.
