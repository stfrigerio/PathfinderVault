> Lying within the rural province of [[Kazuhn Prefecture|Kazuhn]] in [[Taldor]], **Pegaduor** is a vast underground city that dates back to the [[Azlanti Empire]] and [[Earthfall]] itself. Pegaduor was discovered five centuries ago when a farmer stumbled upon a massive sinkhole leading into its depths. At the time, Pegaduor baffled the historians who soon flocked to the site. From the outside, Pegaduor appears as a series of low-lying stone structures but this is only the top-most layer of a truly vast underground city.
> Pegaduor was later identified as an ancient Azlanti ruin, built by refugee from the empire's [[Avistan|Avistani]] colonies shortly after the Earthfall. While many other Azlanti sought shelter beneath the earth and delved much deeper into the [[Darklands]], the people of Pegaduor seem to have stayed within a few hundred feet of the surface. As such, it is believed that the residents never succumbed to the isolation and corruption that created the [[Caligni|caligni]], [[Mongrelman|mongrelfolk]], [[Morlock|morlocks]], and [[Munavri|munavri]] from other groups of Azlanti survivors.
> The ruins of Pegaduor are still a hotbed of activity as new chambers and sub-settlements keep being discovered to this day. It is estimated that at its height Pegaduor must have had tens of thousands of residents. Over a dozen researchers and their entourages are currently exploring the site. The most prominent of these researchers is [[Fareine Oubroulay]], a [[Pathfinder]] originally from [[Nex]]. She has been focusing on a series of hidden temples devoted to [[Scal]], the [[Azlanti human ethnicity|Azlanti]] [[Deity|deity]] of annihilation. Fareine believes that these hidden temples may have something to do with the disappearance of Pegaduor's population.
