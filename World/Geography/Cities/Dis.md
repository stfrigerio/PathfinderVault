> The second layer of [[Hell]] is **Dis** (pronounced DIHS), the Infernal City, a prison for the [[Soul|souls]] of those who used the law to prey upon those around them.
> Dis is ruled by the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Dispater]] who rarely leaves his city, except to the summons of [[Asmodeus]].
> A magnificent, yet twisted mockery of a [[Mortal|mortal]] palace, the court of Dis supplies a constant supply of soldiers to the other infernal layers of Hell. It is within the burning walls of Dispater's garrison-cities that the mortal dead, wrathful and vengeful, are trained and transformed through combat.



## Geography

> The centre of Dis is the [[Iron Scepter]], the palace of Dispater. The city fans out concentrically from the Iron Scepter, and can be divided into three districts: the Iron Heart, the [[Oppidan Maze]], and the Ghetto of Outcasts. Surrounding the walls of Dis is the blasted plain known as the [[Outlands]].
> The skyline of Dis is a series of jagged towers the size of entire settlements, made of steel, [[Iron|iron]], brass, obsidian, and solidified [[Soul|souls]], connected to each other by suspension bridges. The sky is flat and sickly, like smoke rising from burning flesh. The entire city is permeated by a sickly sweet smell like that of searing blood, and in some places, masses of rotting corpses render the air virtually unbreathable.
> Dis is home to two canal systems: the [[Andramal]], which runs with liquid fire; and the [[Lethe]], which guides the [[River Styx]] through the city. Both wind through the most wretched slums and the most affluent neighbourhoods of Dis alike. In such decadent areas, fountains of still-living, petrified [[Angel|angels]] silently scream.
> Any time Dis' layout changes, all maps of the city will [[Magic|magically]] change to match its current layout. Such changes can even happen right before an onlooker's eye.

## Government

> Archdevil Dispater, undisputed king of Dis, rules from his palace as both a cruel [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiend]] and perfect courtly king; there is no building block in Dis that is not arranged according to his prescription. Below Dispater is a complex hierarchy of fiendish nobility, who all have underlings of their own, all the way down to the lowest [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioner]]. Insubordination is punished swiftly and harshly. The city's authorities, particularly Dispater, can remake or repurpose Dis' buildings at will.
> However, Dispater has become mostly bored of the routine of rulership, and often delegates his responsibilities to his wife [[Erecura]] without asking her. Erecura has the right to exercise power as she sees fit, and is often called upon to arbitrate disputes between her husband's minions. [[Adventurer|Adventurers]] can even ask her to overturn a decision made by Dispater himself if they are particularly desperate.
> A major exception to Dispater's rule is the [[Queen of the Night|queen of the night]] [[Eiseth]]. She operates outside of Dispater's hierarchy and defies him when she sees fit; her realm functions more like an independent state rather than as part of Dispater's.


## Inhabitants

> All kinds of [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]], most often [[Devil|devils]] and [[Velstrac|velstracs]], as well as [[Planar travel|planar travellers]] from across the entire [[Great Beyond]], flock to Dis. Everyone with valuable wares is welcomed to do business in the [[Market of Breaths]], regardless of origin, under the watch of the [[Fiendish|fiendish]] [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] Erzylian. Others come to Dis to take their place in the city's hierarchy, or to do business with one of Dispater's dukes. Even powerful non-[[Evil|evil]] creatures sometimes visit Dis under Dispater's protection, for purposes unknown to everyone but him and his wife. Dis has an especially sinister reputation, as many who come end up shackled here for eternity. Nonetheless, the city sees many greedy and desperate visitors whom the resident devils gleefully exploit.
> Countless barracks housing standing armies of [[Levaloch|levalochs]] can be found in the Outlands, where they prepare for or recover from battles against Hell's enemies. The ruling elite of Dis encourages this activity to augment the city's importance within Hell.
> The largest concentration of [[Erinyes|erinyes]] in Hell lives and thrives in Dis.
