> The city-fortress of **Aaramor** stands on the banks of the [[West Sellen River]] in the northwest of [[Numeria]], hard on the edge of the [[Worldwound]].



## History

> Aaramor's construction was ordered in [[1305 AR]] by legendary Numerian kings and named after the [[Aaramor person|founder]] of the [[Blades of Aaramor]]. The city once defended the border against the [[Giant-kin|giant-kin]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]] of [[Sarkoris]].
> In [[1521 AR]], Aaramor's ruler had its northern stone bridge replaced with a fragile wooden bridge to deter giants from crossing the West Sellen River.
> Since the opening of the Worldwound in [[4606 AR]], Aaramor has been Numeria's first line of defense against the [[Demon|demonic]] hordes.


## Inhabitants

> While the town's chieftain is always a member of the Blades of Aaramor tribe, not all of the town's people belong to the tribe.
> The resource-strapped town is led by Blades of Aaramor [[Rothgar|Chief Rothgar]], who must balance his loyalty to the [[Black Sovereign]], the town's defense, the relationship between the townsfolk and tribe, and the fiscal demands of the [[Technic League]].
> The League's representative and tribute collector, the hated [[Kellid]] [[Wizard|wizard]] Kannath, has served since [[4711 AR]] despite multiple attempts on his life.


### Religion

> The town's Iron Hand of Gorum, Andura Jakos, recruits for the [[Mendevian Crusades]] from the [[Chapel of Gorum Aaramor|town chapel]], while Shepherd Euna provides for the town as a priest of [[Erastil]].
