> Situated in the foothills of the [[Menador Mountains]], **Ridwan** sits on a hostile [[Volcano|volcanic]] plain. The city is the religious center for the faithful of [[Zon-Kuthon]], as it is said that the Midnight Lord first emerged upon [[Golarion]] from the smokey Shadowflame Rift that dominates the city's central square. The rift itself is believed to be a [[Planar portal|gateway]] to a particularly unpleasant chasm on the [[Plane of Shadow]] known as the Deeping Darkness. Apart from being a religious center, Ridwan is also home to the training camps of [[Nidal|Nidals]] military, who hone their skills to spread the word of Zon-Kuthon through guile or force throughout the world.


## History

> In the year 4200 AR, Kuthonites began construction of a shrine to their master on the Weeping Fields, the place where the chiefs of the local tribes had sworn their eternal vow to the Dark Prince. A settlement grew up around the shrine in the following years, eventually becoming the city of Ridwan.


## Economy

> Nothing grows on the blasted, volcanic hills and plains surrounding the city, and even water is scarce. All life-sustaining food and drink is brought forth solely by the divine will of the Midnight Lord and his servants. Priests and mages devoted to Zon-Kuthon bring shadowy creatures through the rift at the city's center. After breaking their will, these creatures are then trained to serve Nidal, either domestically or abroad (generally in [[Cheliax]]).
