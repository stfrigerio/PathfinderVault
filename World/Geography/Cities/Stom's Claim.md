> **Stom's Claim** is a ramshackle [[Silver|silver]] mining camp deep in the [[Menador Mountains]] between [[Cheliax]] and [[Nidal]].


## Geography

> Stom's Claim is nestled deep in the Maze region of the Menador Mountains, a chaotic jumble of twisted peaks and valleys. The hamlet sits on a massive deposit of pure silver next to a pungent dark lake known as the [[Silver Tarn]]. As it sits on the border of Nidal and Cheliax, neither nation has yet enforced control over the hamlet.


## History

> [[Kellid]] tribes that once dominated the area were pushed back into the Maze during [[Taldor|Taldors]] conquest of the region. Some stories attribute the area's reputation for [[Curse|curses]] and [[Undead|undead]] activity to the tribes, which are suggested to have made dark bargains in order to survive.
