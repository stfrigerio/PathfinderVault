> **El-Shelad** is a small city on the [[Scorpion Coast]] of [[Osirion]]. It was once just a slave camp housing a part of the hordes of slaves that built [[Tumen]]. The city flourished under the [[Qadira|Qadiran]] rulership of the country mainly because of the resulting influx of [[Keleshite|Keleshites]] that strengthened its economy.
> El-Shelad is a city of fierce political struggle and racial tension. When the first Osirian ruler of the country after 3,000 years of Keleshite rulership, [[Khemet I|Khemet I the Forthbringer]], installed a loyal governor in El-Shelad, he tried to dissipate the political tension. He allowed the city's ruler to retain the traditional Qadiran title of "wali" but the struggle between the Osirian loyalists and Keleshite sympathizers has never ceased. The city is known for its stormy elections which until recently produced [[Garundi (human ethnicity)|Garundi]] governors loyal to [[Sothis]]. Its current ruler, [[Sarita Senbi]] is Keleshite and thus distrusted by Garundi citizens.
