> Waldsby's last leader was Tjorvar Leikovich. In [[4710 AR]] was accused of being member of the underground resistance group, called the [[Heralds of Summer's Return|Heralds of Summers Return]] and [[Nazhena Vasilliovna]] ordered Tjovar's house to be burned down with his wife and child inside and himself to be hung from town hall's clock tower. Since then Waldsby has been without a local leader.


## Economy

> The peasants of Waldsby make their living from the [[Hoarwood Forest]]. [[Winteryew]] and other trees are felled to sell as lumber, and the peasants hunt game within the forest.
