> **Vasterborg** is a heavily fortified town in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province known as [[Verge|the Verge]]. It is located close to the border with the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] and a large part of its population consists of soldiers, [[Ice troll|ice trolls]] and [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]]. The town's businesses cater to the army. There are many taverns and brothels, fighting pits for the trolls and flat hunting areas, called "coursing fields", enjoyed by the winter wolves. A lucrative industry in Vasterborg is the production of fine weapons and armor and a large number of artisans and [[Wizard|wizards]] are employed in this industry. Military [[Jadwiga]] across Irrisen pay excessive prices for the weapons and armor produced in Vasterborg and this trade has made the aristocracy of the town rich. Because of Vasterborg's industry, [[Dwarven|dwarven]] and non Jadwiga [[Human|human]] metalworkers and wizards adept at the creation of magic armor and weapons have gained a high status and they even share a table with Jadwiga at local taverns. Elite artisans in Vasterborg's military industry are [[Posk Railhemmer]], [[Chelia Duvenich]], and the wizard [[Yemoses|Yemoses the Osirian]]. [[Ekaterina|Countess Ekaterina]] is the ruler of Vasterborg, stockpiling wealth for decades to be ready for the struggle for power after the upcoming return of [[Baba Yaga]] in [[4713 AR]] and the disposal of [[Elvanna|Queen Elvanna]].
