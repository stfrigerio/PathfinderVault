> **Port Ice**, on the southern bank of the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]] in northern [[Brevoy]], is a refuge for ruffians and lake [[Pirate|pirates]]. While the city was once the capital of the former nation of [[Issia]], it has been part of greater Brevoy since [[4499 AR]], when [[Choral the Conqueror]] united the region with its southern neighbor, [[Rostland]]. Even when Choral made [[New Stetven]] capital of Brevoy, Port Ice remained the seat of power of the conniving pirate lords of [[House Surtova]].
> When Choral's descendants in [[House Rogarvia]] mysteriously disappeared to a man in [[4699 AR]], [[Noleski Surtova]], then ruler of Port Ice, leapt at the opportunity and took control of the nation in the absence of its traditional sovereigns and has since moved his court to New Stetven to the south.
> King Noleski's uncle, [[Domani Surtova]], serves in the [[White Manor]] as Port Ice's current caretaker.
> The Port is often overcome by ice and snow in the winter months and sits closed, only visited occasionally until the spring's thaw. The summer months are spent frantically stockpiling supplies for the next winter.
