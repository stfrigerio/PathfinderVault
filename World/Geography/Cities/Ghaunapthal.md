> **Ghaunapthal** is the oil-encrusted fortress city of [[Ose]], Duke of Claws. The fortress's thirty legions of [[Devil|devils]] crew the crawling, rolling, and slithering war machines created with the foundries of this [[Outlands]] garrison city. The foundries are never idle as armies of [[Soul|souls]] forge new weapons of war for [[Hell]]. His newest creation is rumored to be a colossal automaton that uses an ancient [[Protean|protean]] relic to drive any [[Mortal|mortal]] who views it insane.
