> The town of **Phaendar** is located in southern [[Nirmathas]] on the southern bank of the [[Marideth River]] near the [[Chernasardo]] region of the [[Fangwood]]. Despite its small size, it is one of the largest settlements in the [[Nesmian Plains]]. The town grew out of a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] stronghold which itself was built on top of an outpost of the [[Shining Crusade]]. The residents of Phaendar, most of whom are skilled craftspeople, mistrust authority and the town has little to no standing government. Most of the town's law enforcement needs are provided by the [[Chernasardo Rangers]] who frequent the town to trade for supplies.
