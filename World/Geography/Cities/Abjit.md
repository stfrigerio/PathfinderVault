> The [[Uomoto]] village of **Abjit** is located near the ruins of [[Kho]] in the [[Barrier Wall]] mountains of northeastern [[Mwangi Expanse]]. As with other Uomoto villages the population boasts a higher than normal number of [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]]. They consider the nearby ruins of Kho as taboo and warn any passing through their village not to take any of the cursed treasure that remains there.
