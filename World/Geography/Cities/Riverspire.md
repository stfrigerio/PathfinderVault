> The [[Elf|elven]] town of **Riverspire** is located on the [[Kyonin River]] in the southwest of the country. It grew from a single family, and the majority of its inhabitants today are still distantly related to one another.


## History

> The settlement of Riverspire started out as nothing more than a single stone tower housing an elven family known as the Morgethai's. Surprisingly, the family proved fecund and a population explosion resulted in the need to expand their structures. Children worked alongside great-grandparents to expand the tower and its outbuildings until the simple ivy-coated spire evolved into a proper town.
> It became normal for elves marrying into the family to move into the compound themselves, often bringing members of their own clans with them. Over the centuries, the settlement became a bustling community, of which roughly two-thirds are related somehow to the original Morgethai family.


## Noted inhabitants

> The [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemist]] [[Damiel Morgethai]] was born in Riverspire.
