> **Whiterock** is a city located on the bank of the [[Yolubilis River]], 50 miles south of [[Kintargo]]. It has long been maintained by the wealthy [[House Jhaltero]], and originated as a stop where rocks mined from Jhaltero quarries were smoothed and catalogued for shipment to Kintargo, but has since grown into a market town for local farmers and ranchers who do not wish to take the long trip to the capital. Its ruler, [[Canton Jhaltero]], is casual and disinterested, viewing himself due an easy life after securing his family's place on the Silver Council.
