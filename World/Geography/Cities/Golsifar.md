> **Golsifar** is a small port town on [[Taldor|Taldors]] [[Inner Sea]] coast, located approximately 90 miles north of the mouth of the [[Jalrune River]] in the prefecture of [[Moda Prefecture|Moda]]. It serves as the prefectural capital.
> As the southern staging point for the [[Taldan Imperial Navy]], the settlement unsurprisingly has strong military leanings.

## History

> On the 28th day of [[Kuthona]], in [[-1144 AR]], [[Taldaris|Grand Prince Taldaris]], the founder of the nation, saved Golsifar from Verksaris the Kingeater, a mighty [[Dragon|dragon]]. From the dragon's mouth, Taldaris ripped the [[Gold|gold]] used to create the [[Primogen Crown]]. This heroic act, unfortunately, led to the death of Taldaris three days later when he succumbed to the dragon's [[Venom|venom]] to which he had been exposed.
