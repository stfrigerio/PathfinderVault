> The (apparently) beautiful spiral city of **Diovengia** is the home of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Abraxas]], ruler of the [[Abyssal realm|abyssal realm]] of [[Pleroma]]. It is a place of complex illusions that continuously transforms itself to appear pleasing and serene to those who travel its streets. It is home to demons, serpents, and souls enslaved to Abraxas and visited by brave seekers of occult knowledge. Diovengia has a countless number of library towers, and is guarded by a group of [[Marilith|marilith]] [[Demon|demons]] led by Abraxas' favoured consort, [[Alistraxia]]. Abraxas is associated with forbidden lore, and there is much within these towers to tempt a brave seeker of knowledge into visiting the [[Abyss]].
