> **Antoll** is the former capital of [[Iobaria]], serving that role between [[3304 AR]] and the fall of [[New Iobaria]] in [[4659 AR]].


## History

> Founded in [[788 AR]], Antoll is one of the few settlements in Iobaria not built upon the ruins of a [[Cyclops|cyclopean]] town, instead constructed specifically for [[Human|humans]], with pipes installed during New Iobaria's height, pumping the warm waters of [[Nyvyrd]] beneath the city, and keeping the city's homes and businesses comfortable year-round. Antoll's modern attractions include its pearl and fishing trades, as well as its great libraries of magical, religious, herbal, and [[Medicine|medicinal lore]] which pre-date the [[Pathfinder Society]].


## Government

> There is an underlying current of tension in the city, as its citizens oppose the region's *de facto* tyrant, [[Rjul|Koffar Rjul]] of [[Veka]], but Rjul's armies and spies have kept the public sufficiently intimidated.
