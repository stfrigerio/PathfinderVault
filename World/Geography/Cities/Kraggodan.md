*This article covers the settlement. For the dwarven leader of the same name, see [[Kraggodan dwarf]].*
> The [[Dwarf|dwarf]] settlement of **Kraggodan** can be found in the southern [[Mindspin Mountains]] within the borders of the nation of [[Nirmathas]].


## History

> Kraggodan is one of the famous [[Sky Citadel|Sky Citadels]], strongholds built at the beginning of the [[Age of Darkness]] when the dwarves first emerged on [[Golarion|Golarions]] surface at the culmination of their [[Quest for Sky]]. Because of this, the city still has many entrances to the [[Darklands]].
> It takes its name from a [[Kraggodan dwarf|dwarven leader]] whose clan surfaced in [[-4944 AR]]. This ascent was accelerated by Kraggodan's discovery of the *[[Onyx Key]]*, a [[Xiomorn|xiomorn]] [[Artifact|artifact]] capable of rapid [[Extradimensional|extradimensional]] travel. Kraggodan used the artifact to lead his clan to the surface, although he died defending his people from [[Orc|orc]] hordes.
> The Sky Citadel named in his honor was completed in [[-4901 AR]]. Before its founding, its people allied with [[Kellid]] clans against the surfacing [[Orc|orcs]].
> The citadel's dwarves began to experiment with the *Onyx Key* in hopes of understanding its powerful magic, but instead opened a path to the [[Vault of the Onyx Citadel]], allowing all manner of [[Outsider|outsiders]] to flood through and devastate their population. Wary of a similar tragic mistake, they sealed the artifact in a sacred vault dedicated to their people's history, safely locked away from curious hands.
> History records few of the settlement's other achievements until the [[3801 AR|38th century AR]], when its stout warriors took part in the [[Shining Crusade]] against the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]], at a toll of much of its population.
> After the [[Rending]] in [[3981 AR]], Kraggodan's dwarves formed ties to the [[Fey|fey]] court of Accressiel in the [[Fangwood]], through its [[Glaistig|glaistig]] queen [[Gendowyn]]. However, the [[4062 AR|next century]] saw the unleashing of the [[Darkblight]] in the forest, which toppled Gendowyn and threatened Kraggodan. Its dwarves formed a barrier of stone monoliths in [[4088 AR]] to stop the Darkblight's spread.


### Recent history

> Despite its location within Nirmathas, Kraggodan has remained neutral in that country's war with [[Molthune]] until [[4715 AR]] when the city uncovered evidence that Molthuni spies had entered the city's vaults.  They welcome members of the [[Pathfinder Society]] to the city as its third prince, [[Gorm Greathammer]], is also a [[Pathfinder]]. However, the [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]] warlord [[Azaersi]] recently stole the *Onyx Key*, an event that precipitated the Ironfang Invasion against Molthune.
> The settlement has been a major trading partner of the Nirmathi mining town of [[Skelt]], but it is not yet clear how the recent opening of [[Bloodsworn Vale]], which has given Skelt a new trade route into [[Varisia]], will affect Kraggodan. It also opened quiet negotiations with the Molthuni city of [[Korholm]], whose [[Korholm Academy|military academy]] hopes to secure dwarven [[Weapon|weapons]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]].
> Kraggodan is just north of the ruined village of [[Graybanks]].


> [[Paizo]] published a major article on Kraggodan in *[[Siege of Stone]]*.
