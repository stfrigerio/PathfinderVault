> **Peijia** is the largely-empty capital of the [[Tian Xia]] nation of [[Bachuan]], built on the northern shore of [[Naikang Bay]]. Established relatively recently by the country's founder, [[Grandfather Pei]], the city was designed to hold up to 200,000 inhabitants; to this day, just over 50,000 have followed Grandfater Pei's commands and relocated there, leaving much of the city uninhabited. As a result, the city's many anti-government anarchists, counter-revolutionaries, and outlaw priests have many places to hide.
