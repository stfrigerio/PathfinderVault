> The temple city of **Kirya** is located in the peaks above the [[Syrzemyan Highlands]] of [[Iobaria]], and is accessible only by flight or via the [[Cyclops|cyclopean]] [[Koloran road]] that runs across the [[Grenalthrost]] and the [[Grenalf Plateau]]. An ancient cyclops temple city surrounding a clear mountain lake called [[Orost-Kar]], the modern city of Kirya was founded by the [[Ulfen]] explorer [[Grenalf]] in [[846 AR]] who named the city after his wife. Priests of various Iobarian faiths soon reconsecrated the temples to their own gods, and the city became a centre for pilgrimages from across Iobaria.
> Kirya eventually became one of Iobaria's largest cities, with new building materials brought in from the [[Orostgard]] forest, until the logging awoke something, leading to the depopulation of Kirya by [[1574 AR]]. Since then, various powers have taken control of Kirya, including a group of cyclopes and [[Hill giant|hill giants]] who built the [[Temples of Blood and Bone]] out of human bodies. The cyclopes and giants were cleared out by one of Iobaria's many plagues, and succeeded by [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]], who ruled until the rise of [[New Iobaria]] in [[3212 AR]] when [[Human|humans]] reclaimed Kirya.
> Under the leadership of [[Rules/Classes/Druid|grand druid]] [[Fedor Vasylk]], the temple city is maintaining its independence in the conflicts between [[Orlov]], [[Kridorn]], and [[Mirnbay]]. Its inhabitants embrace 36 local nature gods who are seen as [[Erastil|Erastils]] children.
> [[Dragon|Dragons]] who were once allies of Iobaria's noble houses are known to inhabit the ruins beneath Kirya.
