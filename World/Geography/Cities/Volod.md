> **Volod** is a small [[Iobaria|Iobarian]] town in the [[Norinor]] built in [[4400 AR]] to replace the former logging town of [[Hroran]]. Located on the [[Noyrus River]], the town has been dominated by logging and woodcrafting trades for much of its history. Recently, strange events have been occurring around Volod, and the town's [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] have been speaking of new [[Deity|gods]] in the highlands and Norinor who are demanding worship.
