> **Vellumis** is the oldest and largest city in the nation of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]]. Situated on the shores of [[Lake Encarthan]], it serves as the port of embarkation and debarkation for soldiers traveling in and out of the country on their way to keep watch over the terrors of [[Ustalav]] and the [[Hold of Belkzen]].


## Description

> Vellumis is a scenic port, with many buildings marble-clad, domed, and colonnaded in the once-popular [[Cheliax|Chelish]] Old White style (characterized by whitewashed walls, ornately decorated eaves, and massive arched windows). The city is the home of all foreign embassies and diplomats in Lastwall, in an effort to keep possible spies far from the front.
