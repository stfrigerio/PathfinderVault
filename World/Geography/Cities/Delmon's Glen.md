> **Delmon's Glen** is a small [[Gnome|gnome]] town located in the far east of the [[Grungir Forest]], in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], at the point where the [[Summermelt River]] flows into the [[Thundering River]]; the town's current mayor is [[Bavakanka Winterlisp]].
> Delmon's Glen is located along the most important overland trade route that connects [[Jol]] and [[Varisia]] to the south with the northern lands. The town is unusually mundane for a gnome settlement. Most of its buildings are like [[Ulfen]] buildings except for their small size. A few larger buildings catering to visitors are located on the edge of the town, like a trading post and the popular [[Raven's Best|Ravens Best]] inn.
> The small town has had trouble in the past with monsters from the southeastern badlands, especially [[Bulette|bulettes]], and Bavakanka Winterlisp many times recruited visiting adventures to protect her town.
