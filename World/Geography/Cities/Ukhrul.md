> **Ukhrul** is one of the numerous prosperous cities of the [[Wide Water]] region of the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]]. Ukhrul sits at the eastern end of the [[Seabound Road]], which with its completion heralded a new era of prosperity for the once desolate region of the [[Western Ghats]]. Ukhrul itself, however, sits on the eastern side of the [[Johar Mountains]] in the north-west of the Wide Waters region, sited nearby the source of the [[Matra River]].
> Ukhrul has a reputation as a somewhat grim city, ruled by the militaristic [[Shavit|Rajah Shavit]], and is renowned for its production of [[Firearm|firearms]] and other [[Technology|technological]] [[Weapon|weapons]]. Rajah Shavit offers these weapons for export but only to distant [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapadas]] so that his expansionist ambitions cannot be hampered by the advanced weapons made in Ukhrul being used against him by his neighbours.
