> The [[Cheliax|Chelish]] settlement of **Taggun Hold** is located in the [[Menador Mountains]] near the [[Nidal|Nidalese]] border.



## History

> The town was founded by [[Dwarf|dwarves]] hundreds of years ago, and dwarven trappers and miners continue to dominate its population. It was named for the town's defense under former mayor Eliazar Taggun in [[4502 AR]], when its inhabitants fended off an [[Orc|orc]] assault by retreating to nearby caves and waging a guerrilla counteroffensive, then rebuilt the city with heavily defensible stone buildings.


## Government

> Mayor Indra Taggun runs the town.


## Economy

> Miningâ€”particularly of [[Silver|silver]]â€”and trapping dominate the town's legal economy, though the extensive tunnels and secret mountain trails that surround it facilitate an extensive, lucrative smuggling operation with nearby Nidal.


## Geography

> Taggun Hold is near [[Saint Ilnea's Fountain|Saint Ilneas Fountain]], a sacred site to followers of [[Iomedae]] and named for the [[God|goddess]]'s [[Ilnea|first saint]].
