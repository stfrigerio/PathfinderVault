> The [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of **Laekastel** is located on northern shores of the [[Inner Sea]], where the [[Brastle River]] flows into the [[Bay of Deng]].



## Geography

> The city is situated on Upland, a tall bluff that overlooks the river and bay, and its waterfront consists of a small strip at the bluff's base with docks for traders (particularly those who avoid [[Ostenso]]), [[Chelish Navy]] [[Ship|ships]], and pearl divers. Winding paths trod by rented mules connect this waterfront to the city.
> A stone and [[Iron|iron]] gate on the city's north side regulates (and is used by tax collectors to indiscriminately tax) traffic between the Brastle River and the Bay of Deng.


## Inhabitants

> Laekastel is home to more [[Dwarf|dwarves]] than any other city in [[Cheliax]].


## Economy

> Laekastel is an industrial city known for its highly esteemed [[Dwarf|dwarven]] crafts, something visibly evident by the sooty clouds and soot-stained roofs. These goods, along with tools and [[Slavery|slaves]], are traded to [[Sirmium Plains]] farmers for their agricultural products.
> The Sirmium Throughway connects Laekastel to the [[Whisperwood]] via Perdition Reach.


## Martial law

> Laekastel was one of several cities in which Cheliax declared martial law due to the looming threat of the [[Glorious Reclamation]], which was active in the Sirmium Plains.
