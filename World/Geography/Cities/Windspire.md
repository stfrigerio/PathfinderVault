> **Windspire** is an independent roost of the [[Windspire tribe]] of [[Strix|strix]] in [[Devil's Perch|Devils Perch]], within the borders of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] [[Archduchy of Hellcoast]].



## Geography

> Made of stone and bone, Windspire's carefully crafted, elevated nests serve as a permanent roost and base of operations for the avian strix. It lies north of [[Crackspike]] and is inaccessible from the ground; visitors can only reach Windspire via flight or [[Magic|magical]] [[Teleportation|teleportation]].


## History

> The Windspire strix faced potential annihilation at the hands of Cheliax after conflicts over a [[Sorvus's Strike|silver lode]] discovery near Crackspike led to Chelish military escalation. The strix defeated the Chelish twice between [[4710 AR]] and [[4712 AR]], but with heavy losses on both sides; nonetheless, Cheliax struck a 100-year truce that limited [[Human|human]] presence in strix lands, including prohibitions against encroachment into [[Tokarai Springs]] and strix hunting grounds.


## Government

> As do most strix, elders of two Windspire's ruling classesâ€”the warrior *itaraak* and sage *rokoa*â€”decide the tribe's course.
> After losses from battles with Cheliax over [[Sorvus's Strike|Sorvuss Strike]] and [[Tokarai Springs]], the Windspire tribe's new *rokoa* [[Kirii]] inherited leadership over Windspire's remaining strix from her mother. Her controversial truce with Cheliax put the Windspire tribe at odds with the larger strix settlement of [[Ciricskree]], which views humans as relatively insignificant creatures who are morally safe to kill and eat.
