> **Ghrinitshahara** is the capital of the [[Rampore Isles]] in the [[Shackles]]. The busy town is located on the central island of the archipelago and is famous for its large harbor and shipyards where captured [[Ship|ships]] are repaired and refitted for sale to buyers across the Shackles, [[Sargava]], and the [[Inner Sea region]]. 
> The cruel [[Rakshasa|rakshasa]] [[Bedu Hanji]] rules the Rampore Isles from his sprawling palace in Ghrinitshahara. The town once resembled the hamlets of the distant Kingdom of [[Vudra]], home to the [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]] mariners who established the settlement. When Bedu Hanji infiltrated Rampore's loose organization and became the master of the isles in [[4662 AR]], Ghrinitshahara became the center of a thriving business around the trade of [[Humanoid|humanoid]] [[Slave|slaves]].
