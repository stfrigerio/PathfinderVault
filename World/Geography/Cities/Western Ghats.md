> The **Western Ghats** is a region of the [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]] characterised by the towering peaks of the [[Johar Mountains|Johar]] and [[Pardaparbat Mountains]]. Most of the Western Ghats biggest cities and [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapadas]] lie in the shadow of Johar Mountains. This region was original settled by the [[Ysoki|ratfolk]] who tunnelled beneath the mountains and for the most part were left alone, but this all changed with the creation of the [[Seabound Road]] between the cities of [[Golquila]] and [[Ukhrul]]. This new route, along with the growing trade between Vudra, [[Garund]], and the rest of the [[Inner Sea region]], has lead to the Western Ghats becoming enormously wealthy. Now countless [[Ship|ships]] ply the [[Betul Sea]] between a dozen or so popular ports.
> The coastal ports are as diverse as they are beautiful, to the north the city of [[Azad]] boasts enough beautiful domes and minarets that it almost seems like it belongs within [[Kelesh]] rather than Vudra. While the city of [[Sihadrimon]] is more influenced by the [[Magic|magical]] and mechanical goods that it trades in. Golquila is defined by its two surrounding walls, while [[Chennipon]] is dominated by its master shipbuilders. Away from the rich coastal trading cities, the [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapadas]] take on a different character. The island kingdom of [[Saman]] boasts the largest military force in the entire region, under the command of its rajah, [[Rani Srivati]]. Meanwhile, in the mountains, the kingdoms there often take on a more spiritual air, the most prominent of these enlightened mahajanapadas is [[Dharget]]. Within Dharget lies the [[Cave of a Thousand Stars]], a holy site with a powerful connection to the [[Plane|plane]] of [[Nirvana]].
