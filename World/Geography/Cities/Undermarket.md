> **Undermarket** is a name given to the various underground layers that stretch beneath the entirety of the city of [[Goka]] as well as much of [[Xu Hong Bay]]. The Undermarket consists of many different layers from various eras and only one rule holds true for all of them: the deeper you go, the more dangerous it gets. The uppermost layers are populated by ne'er-do-wells, thieves, and thugs; while below those layers, lies a warren of catacombs, dangerous vaults, and forgotten temples dedicated to dark [[Deities|deities]]. At its lowest point, the Undermarket connects with the [[Darklands]] in what becomes known as the [[Deepmarket]].
