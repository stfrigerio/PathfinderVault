> **Sosulka** is a small town on the [[Marbleflow River]] in [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of [[Wintercrux]]. It is located between the towns of [[Veshtak]] in the south and [[Iarna]] in the north.
> Its ruler, [[Vilhema|Baroness Vilhema]] has become paranoid, convinced that the peasants upriver in Veshtak are cheating the throne. She repeatedly reports her concerns to Duchess Svetochka in [[Morozny]] and to the [[Cold Sisters]]. Lady Vilhema believes there is a serious peasant conspiracy in Irrisen, centered in Wintercrux.
> What Lady Vilhema does not know is that her fixed attention to Veshtak, blinds her to the fact that her own steward [[Maxum Geranazov]], is secretly a member of the [[Heralds of Summer's Return|Heralds of Summers Return]]; he regularly arranges the theft of shipments to help the resistance.
