> The underground city of **Yin-Sichasi** beneath the [[Gossamer Mountains]] is home to the [[Witch|witch]]-queen [[Lang Loi|Lady Lang Loi]], who rules over the monster-dominated brigand nation of [[Shenmen]] in [[Tian Xia]]. Most people who live in Yin-Sichasi are the witch-queen's [[Slave|slaves]].
> Many of the inhabitants are [[Bestiary/Jorogumo|jorogumo]], like the ruler herself, and on rare occasions will turn into undead known colloquially as “bone-fang jorogumo”. These creatures occupy a half-ostracized, half-exalted position as occult advisors and spiritual intermediaries within the city.
