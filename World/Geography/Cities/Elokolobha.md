> The city of **Elokolobha** is carved out of a massive limestone formation on the eastern edge of the [[Screaming Jungle]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. Its inhabitants are the [[Eloko]], a foul race more widely known as [[Spriggan|spriggans]]. Eloko leaders carve their deeds into the walls of the city, only for later leaders to replace them with their own works. The city itself is filthy, and its buildings are poorly made and often perch in precarious positions. However, the grand chambers within the limestone crags do not appear to have been made by spriggans. The numerous tribes of Eloko survive by raiding each other as well as outsiders. At present, the four strongest tribesâ€”the [[Carrionwalkers]], the [[Fleshstalkers]], the [[Ironbell tribe|Ironbell]], and the [[Graveborn tribe|Graveborn]]â€”maintain an uneasy balance of power. Due to the spriggans' inherently chaotic nature, however, the political balance can shift very quickly.
> Currently, Elokolobha's two most powerful tribes, the Graveborn and the Fleshstalkers, maintain an uneasy truce. 
following violent riots and an assassination attempt on chieftain [[Ukabalimeli]]. The riots were erupted after the tragic end of Ukabalimeli's wife who was the [[Guumkhonto]]'s sister. The marriage was arranged in order to unify the Graveborn tribe and the Carrionwalkers tribe but Ukabalimeli slew and ate his wife when she failed to conceive children. During the riots the lesser tribes collaborated to snatch the opportunity to gain power resulting to an agreement between the two most powerful chieftains Ukabalimeli and [[Inamakosi]] to set aside their grudges in order to maintain their status and their wealth.
> Parts of the spriggan town are held in common by unspoken agreement between the tribes but each individual tribe rules exclusively its own territory within Elokolobha.
