> **Sihadrimon** is one of the numerous prosperous coastal cities that dot the shores of the [[Betul Sea]] in the [[Western Ghats]] region of [[Vudra]]. Each of these cities has their own unique culture and Sihadrimon is no exception. Sihadrimon is the main trade centre for Vudran [[Magic|magical]] and mechanical goods and they have influenced the city immensely. Sihadrimon also serves as a home for numerous [[Rakshasa|rakshasas]] whose schemes are more focused towards the west (rather than the heartlands of Vudra).
> Sihadrimon is the port city in Vudra where Lord [[Garath Arkona]] arrived on the [[Caravel|caravel]] *[[Reprieve]]* from [[Korvosa]] in [[4460 AR]].
