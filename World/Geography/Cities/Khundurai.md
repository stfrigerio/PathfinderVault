> **Khundurai** is a city in the [[Ketz Desert]] of [[Qadira]] that is renowned for its luxurious and exquisite carpets that are exported all across the whole of [[Golarion]]. While most of these carpets only serve as gorgeous floor coverings, if one knows the right merchant it is possible to purchase one of the fabled flying carpets so well known outside of Qadira.
