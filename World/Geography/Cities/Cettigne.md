> Formerly an independent city-state, **Cettigne** was annexed in [[4708 AR]] by [[Molthune]] when the city was beset by [[Plague|plague]] and famine. Molthune's youngest [[General Lords|General Lord]], [[Irina Klim]], was set up as Cettigne's new ruler, but the locals continue to chafe at their new-found servitude. The traditional [[Free City Citizen Militia]] continues to protect the city independently of the General Lords. Friction between the locals and the national forces may soon lead to violence.
> Cettigne is built around four castles representing the various periods of its history; they are reflected on the city's flag, four white castles on a green field. A fifth castle is under construction, representing Molthuni rule.
> Cettigne has a small temple of Abadar.
