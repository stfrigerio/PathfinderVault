> The **Icegraves** is the traditional burial site for the leaders of the [[Varki]] people in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Icemark]]. After having their brains and entrails removed (which are offered to the sky on a platform), the Varki bury the bodies in a grave melted out of the ice. Anyone who visits the burial site can see countless bodies amidst their burial goods perfectly preserved in the ice.
