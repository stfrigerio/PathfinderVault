> **Mzali** is the largest city south of [[Katapesh city|Katapesh]] in [[Garund]], and is ruled by a strange being named [[Walkena]].



## Geography

> The massive temple-city of Mzali stands on the fertile flood plain of the [[Pasuango River]], one of the tributaries of the [[Korir River]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. It is south of the [[Screaming Jungle]], and east of the [[Sargava|Sargavan]] city of [[Kalabuto]]. It is also the southernmost city in what is considered the [[Inner Sea region]].
> Mzali has been built upon the wetlands between the Pasuango River and the encroaching desert. It stands on soft, rich earth and during the rainy seasons, the river rises and the roads flood. The large stone structures like the [[Temple of the Deathless Child]], the [[High Temple Mzali|High Temple]], the [[Mwanyisa Hall]], the [[Sun Man]] statue, and others rest on deep foundations, surrounded by slabs of flagstone that poke above the soil. Knotted trees clasp the stonework like monstrous, withered tentacles.
> In addition to the Temple of the Deathless Child, which dominates the city skyline, Mzali is filled with ancient shrines dedicated to all kinds of entities, some still actively used and others turned into markets or residences. Mzali also holds dozens of underground tombs with only the capstones visible, which attracts many opportunistic grave robbers who seek to plunder valuable treasures, despite the danger.


## History

> Mzali was founded in [[-308 AR]] by warrior-monarchs who claimed descent from [[Chohar]], similar to the [[Pharaoh|pharaohs]] of [[Osirion|Ancient Osirion]]. Dead royals and retainers were [[Mummy|mummified]] so they could continue protecting Mzali after death. The city quickly conquered the surrounding areas. As expansion became more and more difficult, Mzali's royal family became obsessed with blood sports, turning their soldiers into gladiators, demanding children from nearby areas, lavish prizes for victors, and food and fabric as incentives to attract an audience. In [[3967 AR]], a group of governors and priests calling themselves the [[Council of Mwanyisa]] overthrew the royal family and destroyed their mummies, but missed that of the young prince [[Walkena]]. Under their rule, the empire was lost and the city was greatly reduced in size and importance.
> A hundred years ago, the Council prophesied the rise of a new Mzali empire. Later, they uncovered the mummified remains of Walkena. Legend has it that in life, Walkena was a mighty magician, able to call down fire from the heavens. This discovery was viewed as an omen, and thousands of [[Mwangi]] flocked to the city to view the [[Mummy|mummy]]. This influx of visitors brought much needed wealth to the crumbling city.
> The new-found prosperity of Mzali attracted the attention of the [[Chelaxian human ethnicity|Chelaxian]] overlords of [[Sargava]] in nearby [[Kalabuto]]. They raised an army and attacked the city, but were miraculously defeated when the mummified remains of Walkena sprang to life and defended the city, raining fiery death upon the invading army. Walkena then claimed Mzali as his own and became its absolute ruler. Although the Mwangi forces then pushed the invading Sargavan force westward toward Kalabuto, they were eventually rebuffed and thrown back to the eastern banks of the [[River of Lost Tears]] in [[4675 AR]] under the command of General Taurinus.
> Walkena's dreams of military conquest continued after the botched invasion, and his forces conducted guerilla strikes against the defenders of Kalabuto between [[4678 AR]] and [[4684 AR]]. These attacks culminated in the first sacking of Kalabuto in 4684 AR.


## Government

> Walkena rules the city with an iron hand. He handsomely rewards his supporters, but those who offend him suffer the [[Punishment of Seven Angry Suns]].


### War with Kalabuto

> Forces from Mzali have sacked Kalabuto three times in recent years. Because of this, [[Alban person|General Alban]], the commander of Kalabuto's military, now sends regular spying missions to Mzali to keep track of military preparations. So far, except for his initial defence of the city, Walkena has not taken to the field personally.


## Society

> Today, Mzali is the centre of Mwangi nationalism. Walkena seeks to unite the entire Mwangi Expanse under his rule, and aims to drive out all non-Mwangi from the region. Those who trade with outsiders are considered to be traitors, who plunder the Expanse's precious and irreplaceable resources for personal gain. Despite Walkena's authoritarian government, Mwangi pilgrims still flock to the city. Non-Mwangi wisely avoid Mzali, or generally suffer horribly for their temerity.
> Since the colonial government of Sargava was overthrown by its native people without Walkena's aid, many citizens of Mzali have left, enraging Walkena and stirring rumours that he might be planning an invasion of [[Vidrian]]. The tension has also been intensified by the [[Bright Lions]], who seek to overthrow Walkena and return the city to the people.
