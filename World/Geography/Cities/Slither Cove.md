> Once a reasonably prosperous village, **Slither Cove** is now nothing but a sinking ruin being rapidly consumed by the surrounding swamp. Slither Cove's current name comes from the wide variety of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Lizard|lizards]], and other reptiles that now inhabit it.


## History

> Slither Cove became the ruin it is today in [[4697 AR]], when the waters of the surrounding [[Vargas Swamp]] flooded the village. The flooding was permanent, and the villagers abandoned it to the encroaching swamp. Four years later in [[4701 AR]], rumours began to spread across [[Katapesh]] that the flood was no act of nature, but in fact a dark [[Ritual|ritual]] to some foul [[Deity|deity]] that summoned the flood. This rituals were supposedly somehow linked to the statue known as the [[Creeping Watcher]]. The rumours stated that the village was flooded so that the villagers would abandon it, leaving the person who summoned the flood free to search for a mysterious treasure hidden beneath the village. [[Adventurer|Adventurers]] still often search Slither Cove for clues about the treasure; most return empty-handed, and some don't return at all, supposedly falling victim to the village's more ferocious reptile inhabitants.
