> **Aktun** is the [[Divine realm|divine realm]] of [[Abadar]] as well as the capital and largest district of [[Plane|plane]] of [[Axis]].


## Geography

> The streets of Aktun are laid out in concentric circles crossed by avenues radiating from the [[First Vault]] at the centre. Due to the influence of Abadar, Aktun is the friendliest district of Axis to [[Mortal|mortal]] visitors, who are allowed to come to gain inspiration for building cities without worrying about the dangers of [[Plane|planar]] travel.
> Aktun is connected to several other districts of Axis. A set of [[Clockwork|clockwork]] [[Portal|portals]] links it to the [[Citadel of Resplendent Clockwork]], the realm of the [[Deity|goddess]] [[Brigh]]. The underground labyrinth of [[Duskfathom]], the realm of the thief [[Deity|god]] [[Norgorber]], lies beneath Aktun proper, acting like an undercity would to a metropolis on the [[Material Plane]].


### Notable locations

> Although it is located just outside the main gates of Aktun, the Guesthouse of the Cage is tied closely to the divine realm of Abadar as well as the [[Planet|world]] of [[Golarion]], as it is the default arrival point in Axis for many [[Magic item|magic items]] tied to the Master of the First Vault that are capable of transporting individuals there. Inside the district, one of the better known locations is the [[Hearth-Grown House]], the domain of the [[Halfling|halfling]] [[God|goddess]] [[Chaldira]].
