> The ancient hold of **Darinkhuur** is a town in the [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] confederation of [[Yumyzyl]], built in the forested foothills of the [[Wall of Heaven]]. Though [[Kyzuv]] is Yumyzyl's de facto capital, Darinkhuur is its cultural center and has a higher permanent population. All members of the Yumyzyl tribe make occasional pilgrimages to Darinkhuur's spirit-lodges, where the nation's largest canoes are built and receive blessings.
