> **Kridorn** is the second-largest city in [[Iobaria]], passed only by its regional rival of [[Mirnbay]]. Located on sloping cliffs that rise above the [[Castrovin Sea]], Kridorn's towers and lighthouse make it an easily visible landmark for sailors. 
> Founded in [[905 AR]], Kridorn was originally a small fishing town, but its growth was stymied by [[Pirate|pirate]] fleets. [[Iobar I|King Iobar I]] attempted to drive off the pirates, but ended up perishing at the [[Battle of Kridorn]] in [[937 AR]]. [[Hrugil]], Iobar's son, repelled the invading corsairs, and spent the remainder of his reign improving Iobaria's fleets, resulting in Kridorn's growth into a booming port city by [[975 AR]]. Kridorn was able to survive [[New Iobaria]]'s collapse in [[4659 AR]], and became the destination of many [[Galt|Galtan]] nobles fleeing their nation's collapse into revolution.
> Kridorn is considered one of Iobaria's safest cities, despite unreliable services and rampant corruption caused by its leader's thirst for conquest.
