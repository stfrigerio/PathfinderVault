> **Aaminiut** is the largest town in the decentralized [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] land of [[Hasanaliat]]. It lies on the southeastern end of [[Whitefang Bay]] at the mouth of the great Taraska River. Built on stilts, Aaminiut covers numerous small islets in the river delta and the nearby [[Hazalin Marshes]].
> Numerous Erutaki tribes are represented in Aaminiut, each tribe claiming its own islet or (for the smaller tribes) sharing an islet with a few other tribes. The largest clan in the city are the Miusunnit, whose claims in the city include control of the rare ice peppers found in the Hazalin Marshes. Many of the Erutaki migrate away from Aaminiut during the summer months, but most of the town's populace is permanent. A small colony of [[Ulfen]] traders from [[Almhult]] also lives in Aaminiut.
