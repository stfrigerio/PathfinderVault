> The port city of **Greengold** is the second largest settlement in [[Kyonin]], and the only official entry point into the [[Elf|elvish]] kingdom for non-elves. Situated on [[Lake Encarthan]], Greengold is a popular port of call for traders and diplomats. Greengold generally appears as any other [[Human|human]] dockside settlement, except that trees grow in strange places throughout and the yellow roofs on all the buildings makes the city quite distinct.


## History

> In the two millennia since the elves returned to [[Golarion]], they have faced the daunting challenge of reoccupying the ancient territories they once held before [[Earthfall]]. Due their limited numbers and low birth rate, they have not even managed to resettle all of the major cities of Kyonin, let alone the more far-flung colonies across [[Avistan]]. With this in mind, it is unsurprising that Greengold is the second-largest city in Kyonin.
> As part of a bold experiment of controlled integration, [[Telandia Edasseril|Queen Telandia Edasseril]] authorized the establishment of Greengold in order to observe and understand the behavior of outside races. While some elves dislike the intrusion of outsiders into their homeland and the progressive nature of the venture, none can deny that the experiment has proven to be most profitable, as it is the only place in which elven [[Magic|magical]] supplies are available to the outside world. As part of the experiment, the town was given a degree of autonomy by placing [[Selwyn Vanaidorl]], a human, as mayor, although his actions are strictly monitored by elvish nobles.


## Rules and laws

> Generally, the laws of Greengold are comparable to that of most human settlements with some elvish variations. [[Slavery]] is tolerated, but the buying and selling of slaves is not. The trees inside the town are strictly protected by law, as is the forest itself. [[Warship|Warships]], most notably from [[Razmiran]], are refused entry into the town, but peaceful vessels are welcome to dock at Greengold. Most importantly, the town is the limit for outsiders into [[Kyonin]], and the elves do not take kindly to trespassers who leave the town limits. Foreign diplomats are free to plead their case for entry, however.
