> **Khari** is the southernmost settlement of [[Cheliax]], lying at the southern end of the [[Arch of Aroden]] and the [[Hespereth Strait]] that it once spanned. Since the independence of [[Sargava]], Khari is the only Chelish city left on the continent of [[Garund]]. Formerly a [[Rahadoum|Rahadoumi]] city, Khari is the largest settlement in the province of [[Kharijite]] in the [[Archduchy of Longmarch]].



## History

> Desperate to prove his sanity after a catastrophically failed siege of [[Absalom]], Chelish [[Haliad I|Prince Haliad I]] led what forces he could muster to the impoverished Rahadoumi region of Khari in [[4137 AR]]. His easy victory unintentionally granted Cheliax control over the Hespereth Strait, one of the most important sea routes in the [[Inner Sea region]], and inspired him to order an armada further south to found the colony of Sargava in [[4138 AR|the following year]].
> During the [[Glorious Reclamation]], as the Chelish Army and the [[Chelish Navy]] were moved to defend the heartland and southern coast, Khari was left with only a token force. The Rahadoumi [[Council of Elders]] quickly met and raised armies from nearby nomadic tribes and the cities of [[Azir]], [[Botosani]], and [[Manaket]]. After a week-long siege, Khari was retaken by Rahadoum. The Chelish navy stationed at [[Corentyn]] was alerted, but lacked the infantry support to take back Khari.


## Geography

> Khari's sandstone buildings and open markets retain much of its Rahadoumi character. The harbor is dominated visually by the Arch of Aroden and politically by [[House Thrune]], which tightly regulates all mercantile traffic.


## Government

> The lord-mayor of Khari is the known spy [[Marsiol Giovenci]]. He is known among the city's merchant class as a hardliner against black market trading and bribery, and takes state trips on behalf of [[Abrogail Thrune II|Her Majestrix Queen Abrogail II]].
