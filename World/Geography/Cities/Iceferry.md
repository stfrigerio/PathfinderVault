> **Iceferry** is classed as a district of [[Kalsgard]] located on the northern banks of the [[Rimeflow River]]; Kalsgard is the *de facto* capital of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] located on the opposite, namely southern, bank of the Rimeflow. Iceferry is where many of the [[Gnome|gnomes]] of Kalsgard live, who like to think of Iceferry as more of an independent township.
