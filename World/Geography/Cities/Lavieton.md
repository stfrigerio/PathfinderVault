> **Lavieton** is a small [[Andoran]] fishing village on the [[Inner Sea]] coast, approximately 250 miles southeast of the city of [[Augustana]]. The finest [[Fish|fish]] in all of the Inner Sea are said to be caught here, and the fishmonger at the [[Sign of the Blue Sail]] is known throughout the [[Inner Sea region]]. The best fishing is from [[Midsummer|midsummer]] through early autumn, after which [[Waldry Quence]] and the other workers at the Sign of the Blue Sail smoke the fish and prepare them for export. The houses of Lavieton are generally small and of [[httpenwikipediaorgwattle and daub|wattle and daub]] construction, and sit on sandy dunes on the top of a seaside bluff.
