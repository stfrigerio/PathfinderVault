> **Haigui Wan** is a small town in [[Shenchu Bay]] island in the [[Shackles]]. It is built on the northeastern peninsula of the island to serve as the base of Shenchu's defensive fleet which protects the island from [[Dahak's Fang|Dahaks Fang]]. Most of the fleet's ten [[Ship|ships]] are *kobuksons* ("turtle ships").
