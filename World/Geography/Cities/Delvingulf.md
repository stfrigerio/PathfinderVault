> The [[Drow|drow]] port city of **Delvingulf** is situated on the northern shores of the [[Dying Sea]] in the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Sekamina]]. It is one of only two drow ports on the Dying Sea, the other being [[Telderist]]. Its black docks are a well-known landmark and provide docking for vessels trading across that sunless sea with the [[Ghoul|ghoul]] settlement of [[Nemret Noktoria]], and on rare occasions the [[Skum|skum]] of [[Cold Momugado]].



## Government

> The city is publicly ruled by dozens of minor [[Drow noble houses|drow noble houses]], who all secretly answer to the [[Veiled master|veiled master]] [[Uruluura]]. This has not escaped the scrutiny of the rulers of the capital city of [[Zirnakaynin]], who noticed the increasing interactions with the skum, and sent an investigation team who failed to bring back any evidence.


## Trade and outside relations

> As a port city, Delvingulf also has an active role in the [[Slavery|slave trade]] of the Darklands, and regular trade caravans leave Delvingulf for the [[Duergar|duergar]] city of [[Hagegraf]]. The city also has a close connection to the [[Dero|dero]] city of [[Krba]], which maintains an embassy there. Slaves brought to Delvingulf are generally exchanged for [[Magic item|magic items]] and favors.
