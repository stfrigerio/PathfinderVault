> **Thanesrest Mausoleum**, on the island of [[Orthost]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Broken Bay]], is a [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] building that was turned into a mausoleum for kings of Broken Bay. This practice was halted after the body of [[Kernic Quicktongue|King Kernic Quicktongue]] rose up during his funeral, after being possessed of a [[Demon|demon]], to murder then create [[Undead|undead]] of all the mourners.
> It is the greatest mausoleum on the isle and was not originally built to inter the dead. The elaborate mausoleum may have originally served as a Thassilonian castle or prison. Its chambers below extend for many miles deep under Orthost.
