> **Icestair** is the largest settlement in the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], wedged against the wall of ice that marks the edge of the [[Crown of the World]].


## Description

> Icestair takes its name from its main feature: a vast set of [[Human|human-sized]] stairs cut into the ice and topped with carved slabs of [[Volcano|volcanic]] rock, rivalling even the [[Storval Rise]] as the most impressive staircase in the world. There is also a great winch used to haul the sledges and heavy gear of travellers up and down the great wall of ice. Most such expeditions arrive at Icestair from the distant continent of [[Tian Xia]], and Icestair is filled with guides who lead these expeditions to [[Hillcross]] or even [[Wyvernsting]]. Icestair, due to its links with the distant continent, is home to many [[Tian human ethnicity|Tian]] humans and is run by a Tian, [[Po La|Po La the Bureaucrat]].


## Government

> Po La and his assistants maintain the ice stair (which is indirectly assisted by the powerful cold [[Magic|magics]] of the Queen of [[Irrisen]] to the west), carving new steps when the old ones break or wear down, and replacing the winches whenever it is necessary. They also can arrange for well-armed guides to help merchants as they traverse the dangerous lands outside of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. Since the opening of the [[Worldwound]] to the east, there are no absolutely secure routes to the south, Po La is often in touch with the [[Orc|orcs]] of the [[Hold of Belkzen]] in order to establish safe passage through their lands. In return for their guarantees, he has allowed them to hunt megafauna in Mammoth Lords' land.
