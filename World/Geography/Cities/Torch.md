*For another meaning of "Torch", please see [[Grandmaster Torch]].*
> **Torch** is an unusual town in central [[Numeria]] that sits in a crescent around a bizarre, black hillock of shiny black stone known as Torch Hill. Atop the hill is the town's namesake, a brilliant purple bonfire that occasionally explodes into a devastating miles-high pillar of flame.



## Economy

> Torch is a center of smithing and metalworking thanks to the Torch Hill fire's unique properties. Anything that disrupts the flame also disrupts the town's economy.


## Government

> Torch pays a monthly tribute of gold to the [[Technic League]] in exchange for autonomy. The League's ever-changing demands have limited the town's growth and fomented increasing resentment, but the tribute remains low enough to avoid an uprising.
> The town's leadership includes [[Khonnir Baine]], a [[Wizard|wizard]] who owns [[The Foundry]] tavern and has explored the caves beneath Torch Hill's central hillock.


## Geography


### Torch Hill

> A massive mound of black scorched stone, Torch Hill takes up about a third of the town's area, and its edges are lined with buildings blackened by the Torch's intermittent surges.


### The Torch

> As the town's namesake, this permanent violet flame has continuously burned on top of Torch Hill since it spontaneously ignited in [[4602 AR]] and blazed as a massive column of purple fire for nearly two years, scorching the top of the hill black before subsiding. 
> While it requires no fuel to maintain, the Torchâ€”usually the size of an adult humanâ€”is hot enough to melt difficult metals like [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]] and other [[Skymetal|skymetals]]. The flame's properties are inconsistent, however, with some points hot enough to instantly incinerate what it touches and others unable to ignite a piece of paper.
> A pillar of flame reaching several miles into the sky erupts from the Torch several times a year and melts anything on the hillock into steaming glass. These explosions are always preceded by flashes in the Torch that townsfolk learned to decipher as a warning, and its smiths and metalworkers have adapted by using mobile workshops instead of permanent structures.
> In [[4714 AR]], the Torch went out, and Khonnir Baine vanished while investigating the caves beneath Torch Hill to determine what extinguished it.


> [[Paizo]] published a major article about the town of Torch, including a map and gazetteer, in *[[Fires of Creation]]*, and a poster map of the town in the *[[Iron Gods Poster Map Folio]]*.
