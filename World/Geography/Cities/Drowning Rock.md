> **Drowning Rock** is a small town on the southwestern side of the island of [[Tempest Cay]] in the [[Shackles]]. Its position largely shields it from the stormy winds of the north.
> The town is built around a towering monolith that gradually sinks into the muddy soil, and the townsfolk hold their landmark in high esteem. Every summer the town throws a two-day festival, and the main event involves the strongest men coming together and hoisting the rock from the muck via rope and pulley. The town economy is based on its farms and clam fields.
