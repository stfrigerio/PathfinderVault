> **Bronze Bridge** is a small [[Taldor|Taldan]] town southeast of [[Yanmass]]. It bears the unfortunate distinction of being the source of the first mention of the dreaded [[Mothman|mothmen]].


## Mothman

> The [[Pathfinder]] author, Reeve Vaterhal, cites the mothman of Bronze Bridge as the most notable incidence of the species in his book *In Search of Prophecy*, though he goes on to discuss many more sightings elsewhere.
