> The [[Cheliax|Chelish]] settlement of **Dekarium** rests on the northeastern bank of [[Lake Sorrow]] near the mouth of the [[Tomarsulk River]]. Across Lake Sorrow lies Cheliax's capital, [[Egorian]], while the [[Barrowood]] begins just west of the city. The city is renowned for its highly skilled fishermen and abundant [[Fey|fey-blooded]] [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]]. Local legend tells that the townsfolk of Dekarium are descended from [[Nereid|nereids]]. A [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] patrols the land between the town and the forest, mounted on a [[Griffon|griffon]] named [[Ironwing Kazi]], seeking out [[Evil|evildoers]] and those wishing to make sacrifices to their [[Infernal|infernal]] masters in the Barrowood. Much of the village secretly worships [[Gozreh]], including its mayor [[Lalita Jireen]], who manages the town's image and tithes to [[House Thrune]].
