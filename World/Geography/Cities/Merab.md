> **Merab** is the largest of [[Thuvia|Thuvias]] five allied city states, and is the closest thing the land has to a capital city. It is ruled by [[Ilepodus]], Patron of Merab and has adopted [[Sarenrae]] as its patron [[Deity|deity]]. The [[Temple of the Redeeming Sun]] is the largest temple in the city states.
> The city was the birthplace of [[Artokus Kirran]], and it is here that he discovered the *[[Sun orchid elixir|sun orchid elixir]]*, and the city is still renowned for being home to some of [[Garund|Garunds]] best [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Alchemist|alchemists]]. The discovery of the *elixir* lead to foreign powers threatening to attack Merab, forcing the city to establish an alliance with the other city states. 
> As one of Thuvia's five city states, once every five years, it is the city's turn to sell six vials of the prized *elixir* to foreign bidders. The *elixir* is normally transported by heavily armed caravans.
