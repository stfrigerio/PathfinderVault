> Not so much a true city as a stable, permanent location for a vast tent city, **Hillcross** serves as a meeting ground for the various nomadic tribes of the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]].


## Geography

> Hillcross is located in one of the largest passes through the [[Tusk Mountains]], a deep ravine that remains ice-free year round regardless of the freezing storms that ravage the surrounding mountains.


## Inhabitants

> Despite its rough and ready appearance (the tent city is very different to the cities of the south) it is still used as a place for visiting southern merchants to deal with tribes of this realm. It is also often used as a waypoint for travelers who have crossed the [[Crown of the World]] and descended via [[Icestair]] on their way to the rest of [[Avistan]], [[Garund]], and beyond.
