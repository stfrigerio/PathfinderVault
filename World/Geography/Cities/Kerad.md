> **Kerad** is a small peasant community on the [[Rimeflow River]] in [[Irrisen|Irrisens]] [[Bleakmarch]] province. It has little to recommend it, and is often referred to as "Poor Little Kerad" by locals.
> Between the sprawling [[Morozny]] to the east and the [[Zelen]] to the west, Kerad has little to offer to the merchants and travelers of the Rimeflow River. A simple inn and a small drinking house are its only attractions. No [[Jadwiga]] has been sent to govern the Poor Little Kerad and the townsfolk, mostly fur trappers and fishermen, are happy for this. 
Kerad's trappers sail down the river to sell their goods in Zelen. The town elects its mayor every ten years and the current mayor is [[Anichka Labacova]].
> Anichka and a number of the townsfolk are in fact members of the underground resistance organization called [[Heralds of Summer's Return|Heralds of Summers Return]] and meetings of the Heralds are not uncommon in Kerad. A carefully hidden shrine of [[Desna]] is tended by the priest [[Dusana Rivanov]]. Fugitives from the [[White Witches]] or other arms of Irrisen's law often find shelter in Kerad.
