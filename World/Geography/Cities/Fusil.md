> **Fusil** is a town in far-eastern [[Andoran]] surrounded on all sides by the [[Verduran Forest]]. Ages ago, the inhabitants of the hamlet made a pact with the local [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] and [[Fey|fey]]-folk. In exchange for the location of a rich gem mine, the citizens of Fusil pledged that no one would chop down a single tree of the forest. The terms of the agreement have not been breached, and the inhabitants make a decent living from the mine, use only stone in the construction of their homes, and rely on peat fires for warmth.
