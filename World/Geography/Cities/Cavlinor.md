> **Cavlinor** is an [[Elf|elven]] outpost in [[Nirmathas]], lying on the southern bank of the [[Deepcut River]] where it joins the [[Marideth River]]. A few dozen, mostly transient, elves live in this settlement which resembles more a hunting lodge than actual town. The elves are mostly concerned with exploring elven ruins in the area along with diplomatic contact with the [[Fey|fey]] of the [[Fangwood]]. Sivron Nal, the manager of the settlement, was outspoken advocate for [[Half-elves|half-elves]] in [[Kyonin]]. Their appointment here, far from the other elves, might be construed as exile.
