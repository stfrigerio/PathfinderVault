> The small trade city of **Hajoth Hakados** can be found on the [[Seven Tears River]] and is often the first settlement [[Mendevian Crusaders]] visit in [[Numeria]] on their way north to the [[Worldwound]]. Because of this, it seems more like a city in the nearby [[River Kingdoms]] than a true Numerian settlement.



## History

> During the [[Mendevian Crusades|First and Second Mendevian Crusades]], most crusaders made the journey up the [[West Sellen River]], past the nation of [[Ustalav]] and the [[Sarkoris|Sarkorian]] city of [[Storasta]]. When that city fell during the Second Crusade, most travellers decided to take the safer route through the River Kingdoms, past Hajoth Hakados, and from there to the city of [[Chesed]] on the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]].


## Geography

> The city is comprised of three districts: the expansive Palace District at the center, the Homeshore District on the northern bank of the Seven Tears River, and the Fortress District to the east.


## Inhabitants

> Hajoth Hakados is one of a few communities in southern Numeria that openly welcomes [[Android|androids]]. In addition, the city is also home to a small number of aliens living there in secret, kept carefully hidden by their neighbors from groups such as the Technic League who would seek to turn them into subjects of study or slaves.
> An unusual inhabitant of Hajoth Hakados is the [[Witchwyrd|witchwyrd]] trader [[Cythrul]], who operates a shop where [[Skymetal|skymetals]] are bought and sold. Cythrul does an especially brisk trade with [[Mendevian Crusaders]] on their way north to fight the [[Demon|demons]] of the Worldwound, and also has close ties to the [[Technic League]].


## Places of interest

> After the [[Pathfinder Society]] was kicked out of the capital of [[Starfall]] by the [[Black Sovereign]] [[Kevoth-Kul]] in [[4699 AR]] and their [[Pathfinder lodge|lodge]] burnt to the ground, they set up two new lodges in Numeria, one in [[Castle Urion]] and one in [[Hajoth Hakados Lodge|Hajoth Hakados]].

> Hajoth Hakados is one of the few places in the [[Inner Sea region]] for outsiders to purchase black market Numerian [[Technology|technology]]. They do so at the [[Tarnished Halls]].
