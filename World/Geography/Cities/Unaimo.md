> **Unaimo** is a trade town on the [[Crown of the World]], in the eastern Hoarwell March. It is constructed from mounds built into the bluffs on the shore of Lake Yamunaq near the Alasek Ridge, and serves the [[Path of Aganhei]] as the trade route climbs the nearby [[Koumssa Gap]] onto the [[High Ice]].
