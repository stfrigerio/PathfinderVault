> **Green Ridge** is a [[City districts of Absalom|city district]] on the eastern side of [[Absalom]], to the south of the [[Petal District]]. It is one of smallest and least populated parts of the city. It contains a number of extensive gardens and parks, as well as several copses of trees scattered throughout it, that inspire the district's name. Green Ridge also contains many small farms a result of past sieges. In contrast to much of Absalom, the district tends to be peaceful and quiet.


## Geography

> The largest park in Absalom, Evergreen Park, is located here, as is the [[Grand Holt]], a massive fig tree that is said to predate the existence of Absalom.
> The Watchtower, the tallest tower of the city's defenses, is garrisoned here by the [[Eagle Garrison]], the smallest force of the paid guards of the city.
