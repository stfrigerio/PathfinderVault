> The town of **Novoboro**, hidden behind a large fortified stone wall, is a trading post originally built by the [[Elf|elves]] in what is now [[Cordelon]]. It boasts a dozen timber buildings and a two-story stone tower, with archer lookouts on top watching the river on which the town is situated. The path to the town is marked by painted trees and tattered banners bearing the image of a crow. Crows are an important omen to the locals, and killing one is punishable by death.
