> **Larrad** is a large [[Dwarf|dwarven]] city in the region of [[Five Kings Mountains]]. The city is built up around a cluster of temple-caverns carved out by the dwarves in ancient times during the first period after the completion of their [[Quest for Sky]]. The temple-caverns served as a place of worship their gods and as a necropolis for their honored dead. Over the centuries, the temples grew into great complexes hosting many dwarven [[Cleric|clerics]] and acolytes. At the same time the support settlements around the temples expanded and overlapped.
> Larrad's necropolis is used by only the renowned members of dwarven aristocracy. The [[Cathedral of Magrim]] still maintains the tombs of the Five Kings' oldest residents, and employs [[Necromancy|necromantic magic]] to commune with the spirits of the ancestors. The Cathedral also support expeditions into the ruins of [[Saggorak]] which is under threat from [[Undead|undead]] and creatures from the [[Darklands]].
