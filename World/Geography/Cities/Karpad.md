## Tallowthroat

> The virulent [[Disease|disease]] known as [[Tallowthroat|tallowthroat]] originated in Karpad. It spreads by physical contact or by consuming tainted water, and symptoms include waxy skin, a swollen throat, and increased irritability. It is apparently connected to the [[Plane of Shadow]]; [[Fetchling|fetchlings]] are immune to the disease, though they might act as carriers. If untreated, within a few days a fatal, gruesome explosion of the swollen neck goiter releases [[Shadow|shadow]] creatures in the disease's final stage.
