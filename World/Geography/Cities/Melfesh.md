> The [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of **Melfesh** straddles both the northern and southern shores of the [[Yondabakari River]] as it flows into [[Lake Syrantula]]. Built on long piers that stick out into the river, it is was founded by Jorsh Melfesh in [[4569 AR]].



## History

> The town was invaded by a band of [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]] in [[4574 AR]], who attacked Melfesh after being driven from the tunnels beneath the nearby settlement of Biston. They were eventually eradicated by a group of adventurers.


## Politics

> This holding of [[Korvosa]] is the largest and most heavily fortified of the city-state's inland settlements.  As a result, the village is the primary military support for other outlying settlements such as Biston and [[Baslwief]].  Melfesh serves another, more lucrative, purpose, however, in that its massive drawbridge across the Yondabakari grants the village control over trade to and from [[Janderhoff]] via the [[Runtash River]]. The tolls collected are generally shared with the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] city, but have also led to a number of disputes, especially when [[Magnimar|Magnimarian]] vessels find that they are being charged almost double what ships from Korvosa pay.  This is a major reason why there is such a major military presence in Melfesh, despite its relatively small size.


## Economy

> The power of the Yondabakari River's current is captured by a multitude of waterwheels and used by Melfesh's lumber and grain mills.


## Melfesh Monster

> The small town of Melfesh has recently become disturbed by rumours of a strange, deadly creature known as the [[Melfesh Monster]].
