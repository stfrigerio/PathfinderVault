> The small port of **Colvaas Gibbet** is situated in the [[Shackles Mainland|Mainland]] area of the [[Shackles]], approximately 25 miles northeast of [[Port Peril]].



## History

> The settlement was founded in [[4674 AR]] by the notorious [[Pirate|pirate captain]] [[Colvaas]]. Colvaas himself came to a bad end, and his remains still hang from a gibbet situated in the town's harbour, which is where Colvaas Gibbet gets its name.


## Government

> The town's current ruler is the pirate captain [[Hemdak Wavebaiter]], who is actually descended from Colvaas's first mate.


## Inhabitants

> Colvaas Gibbet is not actually on the coast. It is situated a short distance up a wide river. Its inhabitants tend to be taciturn and do not ask questions. As a result, the town is sometimes popular with those who want to keep a low profile for a while.
