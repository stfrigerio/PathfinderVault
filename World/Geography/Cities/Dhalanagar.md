> **Dhalanagar** serves as the *de facto* capital of the relatively young [[Mahajanapada|mahajanapada]] of [[Nayapul]] in [[Vudra]]. Before [[4606 AR]], Dhalanagar was a small port town. When the [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]] died, the [[Obari Ocean]] retreated exposing the land bridge for which the new region of [[Open Bridge]] was named but also leaving Dhalanagar landlocked. When hordes of [[Sorted Traits/creature/aberration|aberrations]] were discovered swarming out of rifts across Open Bridge, Dhalanagar was rapidly fortified by [[Chakradev|General Chakradev]]. Since then, Dhalanagar has grown from a former port town into a full-blown fortress city.
