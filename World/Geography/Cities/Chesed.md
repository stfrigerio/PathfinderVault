> The huge city of **Chesed** (pronounced CHES-ed) is the last port of call on the [[River Road]] for most pilgrims heading to the [[Mendevian Crusades]] before they reach their final destination of [[Mendev]]. It is the final port (or first depending on the direction of travel) along the length of the [[Sellen River]], sitting where the river meets the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]]. Because it is so near the lake, the city is often shrouded by the fog.


## Government

> Chesed is under much tighter control by the rulers of [[Numeria]] than some of the other cities like [[Castle Urion]] and [[Hajoth Hakados]], which belong to Numeria in name only. As the last city that pilgrims visit in Numeria, the [[Kevoth-Kul|Black Sovereign]], ruler of Numeria, sees this as the last chance to squeeze every drop of money from the visitors. The [[Technic League]] who support the Black Sovereign employ a variety of methods to separate the pilgrims from their money including gambling houses, crooked merchants, and river bandits. It is not uncommon for a pilgrim who has visited Chesed to arrive in Mendev with nothing but his weapon and his faith, and even that is often shaken by his experiences along the Sellen.


## Sable Barrow

***Main article: [[Sable Barrow]]***
> Sable Barrow is a hill located outside of Chesed that was the site of a miraculous appearance of the [[Lawgiver]], the [[Herald|herald]] of [[Abadar]] in [[4309 AR]]. It appeared the night before a [[Slavery|slave]] revolt was about to happen, and seemed to indicate that the god would smite the city if its citizens did not reform. After the slave revolt did not occur, the golden herald disappeared.
