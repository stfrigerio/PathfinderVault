>  **Kintargo**, also known as the **Silver City**, is the capital of [[Ravounel]] and is situated on [[Nisroch Bay]] at the mouth of the [[Yolubilis River]]. It is the main harbor for [[ships]] heading north to [[Varisia]] and west to [[Anchor's End]]. 



## Geography

![[Kintargo_skyline.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 The skyline of Kintargo, showing [[Castle Kintargo]] in the left foreground on [[Argo Isle]], and the spires of [[Alabaster Academy]] in the distance across the mouth of the [[Yolubilis River]]. The domed [[Temple of Asmodeus]] may be seen in the right foreground.
>  Kintargo sprawls from the [[Yolubilis River's]] northeastern shore onto part of [[Argo Isle]] in the river's mouth. Its summers are warm and humid, followed by long, cold, and rainy winters.


### Districts

>  The city is divided into north and south ends by the Yolubilis River, with the two halves connected by [[Bleakbridge]]. It is further divided into eight districts:


#### North Kintargo

>  - [[The Greens]], its noble district at the city's northeast border. The [[Silver Road]] leads out of this district's eastern gates.
>  - Schools make up much of the [[Villegre District]] in northwestern Kintargo, including the famed [[Alabaster Academy]].
>  - [[Yolubilis Harbor]] lines the southern shore of northern Kintargo with merchants, with Bleakbridge itself doubling as the city's main marketplace. The northern [[Nightways Gate]] is rarely used except to welcome visitors from [[Nidal]] on the [[Night Road]].

#### South Kintargo

>  - The [[Castle District]] fills the northwestern point of southern Kintargo and hosts the city's seat of government in [[Castle Kintargo]].
>  - [[Jarvis End]], just west of the city's southern center, hosts its vibrant nightlife, and the [[Kintargo Opera House]] is its centerpiece. Barzillai Thrune has taken over the opera house as his residence. [[Aria Park]], immediately south of the opera house, is the city's largest public meeting space.
>  - [[Old Kintargo]], on the west end of south side, borders the river's western fork. Much of the city's salt trade and shipping operates from this district, including the [[Sallix Salt Works]]. [[Ravounel Road]] leads out of this district's broken southern gate, also known as the [[Salt Gate]].
>  - The southeastern [[Redroof]] district features residential and commercial buildings, including Kintargo's [[Tiefling]] slums.
>  - [[Temple Hill]], east of the southern city center, is anchored by the [[Temple of Asmodeus]].

## Culture

>  Kintargo is a cultural capital famed for its [[Art]] and entertainment, particularly the Kintargo Opera House.


### Religion

>  While the official Church of Asmodeus is Kintargo's most prominent, Temple Hill also hosts temples for a few other state-approved faiths, including [[Zon-Kuthon]], [[Abadar]], and [[Shelyn]]. Until the seditious acts of the Glorious Reclamation, even worship of [[Iomedae]] remained legal, if rare.
>  Since enacting martial law, however, Lord-Mayor Thrune mandated the registration of all worshipers of Shelyn and monitoring of all Shelynite religious services. Worship of deities aligned with freedom or rebellionâ€”including [[Calistria]], [[Cayden Cailean]], [[Desna]], [[Milani]], and [[Sarenrae]]â€”are strictly outlawed. The [[Silver Star]] shop and popular Sarenite shrine, owned by local [[opera]] star [[Shensen]], was burned to the ground during the Night of Ashes, when agents of Barzillai Thrune also attacked local cults devoted to Milani and [[Irori]].


## History

>  Much of Kintargo's past is unknown, in part due to suspected tampering with historical documents and records by agents of House Thrune. Scraps of information remain, such as the city's unknown connection to the local [[dragons]] Adrakash, [[Ithanothaur]], and [[Rivozair]]; stories of the [[Temple Hill Slasher]]; and the strange patterns of the Church of Asmodeus's Devil's Bells.


### Chelish Era (â€“4717 AR)

>  Under Cheliax, Kintargo was part of the [[Archduchy of Ravounel]]. Unprotected by any natural barriers, the city and its citizens were among the most cosmopolitan in Cheliax, and the infernal influence so prominent in other Chelish cities was not nearly as noticeable in Kintargo. This also made the city a convenient home for those looking to overthrow the Chelish government, and after instigators of the [[Glorious Reclamation]] fostered open rebellion in southeast Cheliax in [[4715 AR]], [[House Thrune]] installed [[inquisitor]] [[Paracount Barzillai Thrune]] as the city's new lord-mayor and established martial law.


#### Presence of the Chelish Navy

>  As a major port, the city was frequently visited by ships of the [[Chelish Navy]], which tend to exert a pall over life in the city. Seeking to give the naval commanders and crew a good show, former Lord-Mayor [[Jilia Bainilus]] tended to enforce the dictates of church and state before relaxing all that nonsense again after they departed.


#### Martial law

>  House Thrune placed Kintargo under a state of martial law, forcing former Lord-Mayor Bainilus out of power around the beginning of [[Arodus]] in 4715 AR. Bainilus has since gone missing.


#### Night of Ashes

>  In late [[Arodus]], [[4715 AR]], Barzillai Thrune's agents attacked dissident groups and members of [[Sarenrae's]] and [[Milani's]] faiths, killing several leaders and burning buildings. The sudden attack is locally known as the **Night of Ashes**.


#### Barzillai Thrune's proclamations

>  Lord-Mayor Thrune quickly started issuing binding proclamations to Kintargans, enacting seven in his first two weeks alone. This includes a daily curfew from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.

The dottari rewards those who kill [[doves]], mice, and [[ravens]] with one [[copper piece]].
Businesses must display a portrait of Queen Abrogail II, at least 11 inches by 17 inches in size, prominently in the building's entrance.
The dottari rewards those who deliver unharmed feral [[dogs]] of 50 pounds or more with one silver piece.
Wearing fine embroidered clothing without the city's permission is banned, except for agents of House Thrune or the church of Asmodeus.
Spilled grain must be cleaned and repackaged within an hour or face a fine of one copper piece per grain.
Drinking [[Tea]] after curfew results in a fine of 10 gold pieces or incarceration.
Owning or consuming confections or beverages containing mint results in a fine of 20 gold pieces or incarceration.

## Economy

>  Kintargo's bustling riverside docks export salt, seafood, and [[silver]].


## Organizations


### Church of Asmodeus

>  Under Cheliax, the state church of Kintargo was led by the unpopular [[Corinstian Grivenner]].


### Court of Coin

>  Under Cheliax, the eight noble families of the [[Court of Coin]], once treated as trusted advisers, were largely ignored by Lord-Mayor Thrune.

>  - [[House Aulamaxa]]
>  - [[House Aulorian]]
>  - [[House Delronge]]
>  - [[House Jarvis]]
>  - [[House Jhaltero]]
>  - [[House Sarini]]
>  - [[House Tanessen]]

>  Under Cheliax, the [[Hellknights]] were once prominent within the city.


#### Order of the Rack

>  With the installation of martial law, the city hired a group of [[Hellknights]] from the insurrection-quashing [[Order of the Rack]] led by [[Paralictor Kyrre Ekodyre]].


#### Order of the Torrent

>  The city was also the only home of the otherwise nomadic manhunters of the Hellknight [[Order of the Torrent]]. Its leader, [[Lictor Octavio Sabinus]], reportedly went missing.


### Silver Ravens

***Main article: [[Silver Ravens]]***
>  With the Rose of Kintargo and [[Sacred Order of Archivists]], the [[Silver Ravens]] were among the city's organized dissidents destroyed by House Thrune after the installation of martial law. Some of its ranking members were publicly executed after the declaration of martial law.
