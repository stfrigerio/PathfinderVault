> **Corvischior**, sometimes spelt **Corvischoir**, is located in the south of the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Varno]]. The town is now a shadow of its former self, the derelict county capital, and sits across the water from the equally forlorn [[Castle Corvischior]], once the residence of the noble Tiriac family. Though still technically subject to the absentee [[Ristomaur Tiriac|Lord Ristomaur Tiriac]], it has sat fallow for decades, though rumours speak of strange lights and unnerving shadows up at the castle. The most pessimistic residents whisper that Castle Corvischior, once known as Korsinoria Palace, is [[Curse|cursed]], and whatever fell hex hangs over the castle has now settled over Corvischior as well.
