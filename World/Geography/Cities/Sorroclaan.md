> **Sorroclaan** is a [[Catfolk|catfolk]] settlement located around an [[Iobaria|Iobarian]] ruin in the [[Fangard]] forest.


## History

> Many centuries ago, Eye Thief and Morukel led their followers out of [[Murraseth]] to protest the ban on exploring dangerous [[Mwangi]] ruins enacted by the [[Council of Elders]]. After leaving Murraseth, they discovered countless nameless ruins in the Fangard which they could freely explore, and built Sorroclaan in and around them.


## People

> Sorroclaan's catfolk tend to be tall and broad, and possess pale or striped fur and skin. They have a virtual monopoly on exploring the ruins in the Fangard, where [[Human|humans]] fear to tread. Many hold superstitions about 'half-catfolk', due to the relative frequency of [[Werecreature|lycanthropy]] in the Fangard: some view werecreatures and [[Skinwalker|skinwalkers]] as [[Evil|evil]] creatures that test their resolve, others revere and fear them as emissaries of nature.
