> The city of **Armun Kelisk** is the political and religious capital of the [[Djinni Empire]] and of [[Djinni|djinni]] society in the [[Plane of Air]].



## Districts & Geography

> Armun Kelisk sprawls across seven stone, ice, and silver platforms, each miles across. Each platform is curved or cast to resemble the terrain of a terrestrial city of the [[Material Plane]]. The city configuration is a mutable thing, having occupied dozens of forms since its construction thousands of years ago. The current seven island districts are:

> - [[Cirussean Ward]]
> - [[Cyan Keep]]
> - [[Godsward]]
> - [[High Palaces]]
> - [[Lower City Armun Kelisk|Lower City]]
> - [[Luminous Court]]
> - [[Silversky Markets]]

## Economy

> Trade and commerce take place along the city fringes, with platforms for docking flying vessels and perches for flying mounts. The districts of Lower City and Silversky Markets are the two most trade-focused districts within the city. The Silversky Markets district, in particular, is home to incredibly unique items that cannot be found anywhere else in the [[Great Beyond]].


## Government

> Armun Kelisk serves as the capital of the entire Djinni Empire and the heart of this is the [[High Palaces]] district. The most prominent structure in the High Palaces, and all of Armun Kelisk, is the [[Sussurran Palace]] of [[Zafer XXXVIII|Sultan Zafer XXXVIII]], "Lord of the Heavens and All the Stars of the Mortal Void" and the direct ruler of the entire empire.


## Religion

> Armun Kelisk boasts an entire district devoted to the [[Deity|gods]] and ancestors of its djinni inhabitants, the Godsward. The great temple of [[Gozreh]], the [[House of the Infinite Strata]], sits at the heart of the district and is made from [[Magic|magically]] frozen and shaped storm clouds.
