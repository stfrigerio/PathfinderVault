> What is now known as the **Puddles** district of [[Absalom]] was greatly affected, like much of the city, by a massive earthquake in [[4698 AR]]. It caused this district to drop below sea level at high tide, causing flooding and erosion. The center of the district is now a festering lake, known as the Little Inner Sea, and most businesses are calf-deep in water even at low tide.



## Inhabitants

> Unsurprisingly, most of the district's inhabitants who could leave the area have done so, leaving behind addicts, criminals, and the poor to fend for themselves in an environment as derelict as their squalid lives. Misfortune and destitution are not the only reasons someone might live in the Puddles. The inhospitable environment and lack of public funds means less attention from the city watch, making the district the perfect hunting ground for those wishing to prey on the weak and an ideal breeding ground for thieves' guilds, more than a handful of which operate out of the waterlogged quarter.
> The Puddles is home to a small [[Tiefling|tiefling]] ghetto; despite ending up in the worst part of Absalom, tieflings still find more acceptance here than in most parts of [[Avistan]]. Very recently, [[Goblin|goblins]] of the [[Crookedtoes|Crookedtoe tribe]] arrived in the Puddles to find a new home for themselves. They have since settled in an abandoned playhouse on the western edge of the district.


## Skyways

> The few hardy folk who remain in the Puddles have transformed the district by building countless small bridges and ramps between its closely-packed buildings to avoid the flooded roads below. These platforms form a network of rickety skyways that allow the traveler to crisscross the district without ever touching the ground, providing they have a good sense of balance.
