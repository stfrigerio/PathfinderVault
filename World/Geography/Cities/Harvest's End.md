> **Harvest's End** is a small village located near where the [[Rimeflow River]] and the [[Iceflow|Iceflow River]] meet in the [[Bleakmarch]] region of [[Irrisen]]. The village mainly sustains itself from fishing and trade, with the traveling merchants standing out sharply with their colorful clothes next to to drab woolen clothes of the villagers. The town also has a ferry for merchants and lumberers to cross the Rimeflow River operated by an [[Ice troll|ice troll]] named Rimetusk.
> Rimetusk serves as the *de facto* leader of the town after allowing his ego to grow too large, since the town's isolation from [[Whitethrone]] means that Rimetusk communicates infrequently with the [[Jadwiga]] to whom he is supposed to report.
