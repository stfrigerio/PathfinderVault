> **Outsea** is a town in the [[River Kingdoms]] containing farmland, swampland, rivers, and canals. Its citizens include both aquatic species as well as air-breathers. Military service is mandated for all water-breathers and a few landlubbers serve in respected voluntary battalions. Locks and gates separate freshwater and salt water, preventing the districts from flowing into each other. Beneath the waterline, coral reefs and seaweed form underwater structures. [[Fish]], [[Octopus|octopuses]], and other aquatic [[Animal|animals]] are prevalent. Mages of Outsea are known for their strong tradition of practicing water [[Magic|magic]]. Unique [[Spell|spells]] of [[Merfolk|merfolk]] and [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] origins can be found only in this kingdom.



## Government

> The city of Outsea, as well as its holdings on land and at sea, are ruled by the Council of Generals. The council represents each of the sentient aquatic races of Outsea and all members are generals in the military. Landlubbers are represented by an advisory circle, which makes requests to the Council of Generals regarding their interests.


## History

> Outsea was created when a force of [[Ceratioidi|ceratioidi]] mercenaries traveled through the [[Sellen River]] to make war on enemy merfolk. However, their magic failed and they and other saltwater races were trapped in an area of magical brine, deep in the center of the River Kingdoms.


## Inhabitants and society

> Outsea is rather unique among settlements of water-breathing races due to the large number of separate species that coexist peacefully within it. Although many are descended from races that are traditionally inimical to each other, or openly hostile to most other species, the centuries of forced cooperation required to maintain their small pocket of sea among the freshwaters of the Sellen watershed has resulted in most of Outsea's residents being willing to live peacefully with each other and work alongside both air-breathers and former enemies. The resulting peaceful and mixed society can be very strange to those used to the more typical behaviors and hostilities among sea-dwelling races.
> Besides the merfolk and sahuagin majorities, Outsea is also home to marine [[Naga|nagas]], [[Triton|tritons]], [[Sea hag|sea hags]], [[Ceratioidi|ceratioidi]], and small populations of [[Chuul|chuul]], [[Gillmen|gillmen]], and [[Skum|skum]].
> Ceratioidi are in the minority of Outsea's population, but they resemble Danglosa, the rarely seen angler fish [[Deity|god]]-ruler of Outsea. As a result, the ceratioidi are held in high respect by other residents of Outsea.
