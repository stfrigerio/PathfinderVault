> **Mount Na-Ken** is a peak in the [[Shining Mountains]] of [[Osirion]]. An isolated and sparse temple, no more than a few slabs of granite perched on a thin ledge, is located on the mountain. It is the home of a clan of ascetic worshipers of [[Irori]] who believe the [[Ethereal Plane]] and its manifestations of dreams and nightmares offer the answers they seek. The [[Monk|monks]]' leader is [[Sethir Lannoth]], who has perfected a [[Fighting style|technique of hand-to-hand combat]] that initiates brief entry to Ethereal Plane.
