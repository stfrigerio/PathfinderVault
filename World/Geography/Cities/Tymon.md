> The city-state of **Tymon** lies southwest of [[Daggermark]] on the very western borders of the [[River Kingdoms]], next to the kingdom of [[Razmiran]]. It is renowned for its gladiators, as Tymon boasts both a huge arena and many prestigious gladiator colleges.



## History

> Tymon's history of gladiatorial excellence goes back to its founder, [[Maldar Tymon]], who was a renowned [[Taldan human ethnicity|Taldan]] gladiator and hero of one of [[Taldor|Taldors]] [[Army of Exploration|Fifth Army of Exploration]].


## Local conflicts

> Tymon's most famous gladiators inspire such passion amongst the citizens of the River Kingdom, that political feuds, murders, and even small wars have broken out between rival groups of fans.


## Relations with Razmiran

> The proud gladitorial heritage has made Tymon a visible target, and the living god [[Razmir]] greedily eyes the city with conquest on his mind. Ullorth Ungin has to contemplate turning his valuable gladiators lose on the field of battle, supported by the bloodthirsty priests of [[Gorum]]. Each year Ullorth asks that any on the [[Outlaw Council]] who value freedom step forth to help him, and each year one or two petty lordlings offer their help, postponing Razmir's invasion for another year.
