> **Raketooth** is the second largest port on [[Shark Island]] in the [[Shackles]]. It is a dreary settlement specializing in pilfered luxury wares that usually are sold in [[Motaku Isle]] or to the few non-[[Slavery|slaver]] merchants who come to Shark Island. Raketooth doesn't often have difficulties with the [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] that plague the island. The [[Pirate lord|pirate lords]] of Raketooth, [[Mauril Breakwater]] and "Baron" [[Venigo Palpathe]], maintain the relative peace of the town by providing tribute to the nearby sahuagin tribes.
