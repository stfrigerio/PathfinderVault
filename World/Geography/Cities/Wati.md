> **Wati, the Half-City** was the largest of the trio of cities in southern [[Osirion]] until its population was ravaged by the Plague of Madness in [[2499 AR]]. The contagion was conjured and spread by the cult of [[Lamashtu]], taking advantage of the religious conflict raging across [[Garund]] during this period. Wati was slowly abandoned by the surviving population. In [[2953 AR]], the priesthood of [[Pharasma]] established a major temple and consecrated the city in the memory of the murdered dead, setting aside the abandoned sections of Wati in their honor. In the past thousand years, the living section of the city has expanded and the abandoned part is now less than a fourth of its overall area. The abandoned sections of the town are largely inaccessible due to local stigma, and adventurers with the blessing of Pharasma's clergy sometimes target the area. The city of Wati was originally founded in [[-1608 AR]] by [[Djederet II]] during the [[First Age of Osirion]].
