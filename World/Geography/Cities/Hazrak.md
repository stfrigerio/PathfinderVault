> **Hazrak** is a [[Minotaur|minotaur]] settlement located in the Riven Hills of the [[Isle of Kortos]] in [[Absalom]]. Its inhabitants can trace their town's origins all the way back to the [[First Siege of Absalom]] in [[23 AR]]. During this war, the minotaur warlord [[Voradni Voon]] brought thousands of his kind through the [[Brazen Arch]] to lay siege to Absalom. After their defeat by the [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]] himself, the surviving minotaurs fled to the central highlands of the island, where they (or their descendants) founded Hazrak, and continue to harass the other races of the island to this day.
