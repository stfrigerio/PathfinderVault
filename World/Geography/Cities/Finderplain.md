> Near the center of [[Katapesh]], the small [[Gnome|gnome]] city of **Finderplain** provides temporary home for travelers exploring the area.
> Finderplain has stood 300 years as a way-point for gnomes traveling south of the [[Inner Sea]]. It holds almost 2,000 residents, but the constant influx and departure means that the number could change completely every few years. Families rarely establish permanent homes in Finderplain; the lure of adventure and desert beckons, and the gnomes move on, leaving their houses empty for the next travelers. The transitory nature of the gnomes means that no individual consistently rules over Finderplain. The current ruler is a gnome [[Bard's End|bard]] named Wexlis Bean.
