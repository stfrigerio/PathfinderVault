> **Darkmoon Vale** is a frontier region in northwestern [[Andoran]] stretching from the [[Arthfell Forest]] on its southern border to [[Darkmoon Wood]] and [[Droskar's Crag|Droskars Crag]] in the north.



## Geography

> The [[Foam River|River Foam]] is the primary waterway in the region and cuts a line through the center of the Vale. While Darkmoon Vale consists mostly of frontier lands it nevertheless hosts several mentionable settlements. These include [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]], [[Olfden]], [[Oregent]], and [[Piren's Bluff|Pirens Bluff]]. Despite the region's many dangers, Andoran remains interested in the Vale's natural resources, from [[Darkwood|darkwood]] to [[Silver|silver]], and its access to the [[Isger|Isgeri]] border.


### Woodlands

> The two main woodlands in the Darkmoon Vale are the Darkmoon Wood, located between the [[River Foam]] and the [[Five Kings Range]], and the northern reaches of the Arthfell Forest. At one point in time they were one continuous forest, but the lands between them have been clear cut over the preceding centuries. This logging continues to create great tensions between the [[Human|human]] Andorans and the native [[Fey|fey]] protectors of the forest.


## History

> The history of the region goes back before [[Taldan]] and [[Chelaxian]] humans first settled in the region in the mid-42nd century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]]. In [[3980 AR]], it was rocked by the eruption of Droskar's Crag, a [[Volcano|volcano]] just north of the Vale. The event, known as the [[Rending]], destroyed the nearby [[Dwarf|dwarven]] settlement of [[Jernashall]] and flooded the Foam and [[Andoshen River|Andoshen Rivers]] with millions of gallons of snowmelt. The resulting flooding caused widespread destruction along the banks of the rivers, particularly in the capital of [[Almas]] hundreds of miles away.
> The indigenous [[Kellid]] inhabitants of Darkmoon Vale were first conquered in [[4113 AR]] by [[Karas Novotnian|Karas the Falcon Novotnian]].


## Government

> Due to its geographical isolation from the capital [[Almas]] and the rest of heartland Andoran, Darkmoon Vale is given quite a bit of political autonomy, a situation that substantially benefits the [[Lumber Consortium]]. This militaristic and tyrannical organization covets the region's large stands of [[Darkwood|darkwood trees]].


## Inhabitants

> The wild reaches of the Darkmoon Vale are rife with [[Kobold|kobolds]], [[Fey|fey]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[Hag|hags]] and [[Worg|worgs]]. The Vale is also home to [[Flame drake|flame drakes]] which have recently begun raiding across the border into neighbouring [[Isger]].
> The [[Novotnian family]] of Darkmoon Vale is known throughout Andoran and beyond for developing advanced [[Falcon|falconry]] techniques.
