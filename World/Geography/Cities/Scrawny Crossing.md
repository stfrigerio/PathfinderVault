> The abandoned hamlet of **Scrawny Crossing** is in the western [[River Kingdoms]]. It served as a ferry crossing and caravan stop until [[4706 AR]], when its inhabitants disappeared in mysterious circumstances.
> Unbeknownst to the folk of the region, Scrawny Crossing now serves as a base for a band of aquatic [[Slavery|slavers]]â€”[[Scrag|scrag]]/[[Skum|skum]] cross-breeds. These monsters capture [[Humanoid|humanoids]] for use in strange experiments.
> Their leaders are a [[Naga|naga]] ("[[Slissk|Lord Slissk]]"), a scrag sorcerer ("Thult-Lorth") and a [[Sea hag|sea hag]] ("Mother Slug"), although they in turn take their orders from a telepathic creature that might be an [[Alghollthu master|alghollthu master]].
