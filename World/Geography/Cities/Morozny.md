## History

> In the [[Winter War]] of [[3313 AR]], the city of Morozny decided to surrender to the armies of [[Baba Yaga]] without a single fight. The people of Morozny were always practical men and they said they surrendered because it was obvious that Baba Yaga would prevail. The thanes of [[Djurstor Confederacy]] labeled Morozny with the coarse epithet "the Whore Who'll Spread for Anyone" which is still in use by a number of knowledgeable [[Ulfen]].
> [[Urvalane|Queen Urvalane]] named Morozny capital of Wintercrux when she established the new province of the [[Verge]], splitting the old region of Wintercrux in two. Morozny was already a large city and it has been proved obedient to [[Jadwiga]] rule. The capital of the original province of Wintercrux, [[Redtooth]], became the capital of the newly formed province.


## Description

> Morozny is built on the south bank of the [[Rimeflow River]] and on two islands in the middle of the river (the Grand Isle and the Castle Isle). It is home to a flourishing metalworking industry which produces armor and weapons for all of Irrisen, and even exports some abroad.
