> **Ysborg** is located just below the snowline on the northern slopes of [[Mount Gnarlfang]], in the western [[Kodar Mountains]] at the far south-eastern corner of the Linnorm Kingdom of [[Southmoor]], where borders provide no real barrier to the eternal winter of neighboring [[Irrisen]].
> Ysborg, the 'Steading of the Ice Trolls', is something between a town and a fortress, consisting of crude wooden buildings and hide tents, all sized for [[Giant|giant]] occupants, surrounded by a stout wooden palisade. The entire fortress is surrounded by a moat of nearly freezing water inhabited by numerous [[River drake|river drakes]].
> [[Frost troll|Ice trolls]], [[Ettin|ettins]], [[Ogre|ogres]], and other giants come from all across the Linnorm Kingdoms to join the army of the [[Blue Jarl]], a huge powerfully muscled ice troll with a giant battleaxe curved from magical ice.
> The streets of Ysborg are dangerous, with brutal fights and fresh blood on the snow to be a common sight. The Blue Jarl's "[[Winter Palace]]" is one of of Ysborg's few stone buildings. It is nothing more than a blocky pile of icy rocks but it is well-fortified. The throne of the Blue Jarl is made from carved [[Mammoth|mammoth]] tusks and is decorated with [[Human|human]] skulls. The Blue Jarl's kennels, just outside the palace are filled with [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]] who have sworn allegiance to the jarl and the Bear Pits host ferocious [[Polar bear|polar]] and [[Grizzly bear|grizzly bears]] armored and trained to fight.
> The Blue Jarl is always accompanied by his loyal [[Frost giant|frost giant]] shield maidens, as well as by the huge, white-furred [[Dire bear|dire bear]] that serves as his mount.
> Ice troll marauders from Ysborg frequently raid neighboring human settlements for slaves, or more often, fresh food, for ice trolls relish the taste of human flesh. The villages have appealed to [[Trollheim]] for aid but for now usually defend themselves or abandon their villages. Rumors hold that Irrisen has been courting Ysborg as an ally, but so far, the trolls remain independent.
