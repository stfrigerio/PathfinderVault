> The **Conservatory** is a secret, [[Jalmeray|Jalmeri]] training school for spies located on the inaccessible island of [[Grand Sarret]] in the [[Obari Ocean]]. Housed in a collection of buildings that once served to house the harem of the legendary [[Khiben-Sald|Maharajah Khiben-Sald]], the Conservatory now trains students in the arts of seduction, cooking, [[Music|music]], and the careful manipulation and influence of governments around the world. Once they complete their training, the graduates are sent to courts, noble houses, and seats of power throughout the [[Inner Sea region]] in order to further the ambitions and interests of the government of Jalmeray. They report back to the Conservatory on a regular basis, where their information is catalogued in an extensive, ever-growing library on the island, one of the greatest repositories of secret knowledge throughout the Inner Sea region.
