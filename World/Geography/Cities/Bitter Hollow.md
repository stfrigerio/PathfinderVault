> **Bitter Hollow** is a tiny thorp on the banks of [[Lake Coal]] in central [[Varisia]].  It is home to only a small number of hunters and trappers, as Lake Coal has very poor fishing.  The Gator's Nest, Bitter Hollow's only trading post, is located in the center of town.  The founders of Bitter Hollow must have had some foresight, as they built the wood and reed walkway known as the Wicker Walk to encourage trade with [[Gnome|gnomes]] of the nearby [[Sanos Forest]].  Although trade with the gnomes is not regular, one can find interesting and unusual items for sale at the Gator's Nest from time to time.
