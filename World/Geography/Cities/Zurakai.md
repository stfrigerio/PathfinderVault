> There are several contradictory legends about the apparently lost city of **Zurakai** in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. A fallen statue at the source of the [[Ocota River]] apparently once pointed the way to the city's location.
> The most widely accepted theories are that the city is either a pre-[[Earthfall]] colony of ancient [[Azlant]], which might have survived the destruction of its parent empire; or a city established by followers of the ancient Azlanti queen and future [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Zura]] in the depths of the jungle.
> If the statue fell in a straightforward fashion, then it pointed into the heart of the [[Mwangi Jungle]], into a region in which no relics of Azlant have ever been found. If it twisted when it fell, it could have been pointing anywhere, including towards the [[Arcadian Ocean]], in which case Zurakai lies somewhere beneath the waves, along with the rest of the Azlanti Empire.
> The most outlandish theory is that the statue did not fall; it was intended to be in its current position, pointing into the earth. If so, Zurakai is somewhere in the [[Darklands]].
