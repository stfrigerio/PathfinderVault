> The monastic settlement of **Tar Kuata** is dedicated to the god [[Irori]], and can be found among the peaks of the [[Barrier Wall]] in southwestern [[Osirion]], near the [[Footprints of Rovagug]] and the borders of [[Thuvia]] and the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. The [[Monastery of Tar Kuata]] was founded by [[Narmek Tar Kuata]], a [[Sothis|Sothan]] priest of Irori now venerated as a saint.
> Many among the [[Pahmet]], the sand dwarves, claim that Tar Kuata is home to some of their contemplative brethren, the [[Ouat]], who are scholars of the martial arts taught in the monastery. The Ouat are in fact an isolated caste of [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[Monk|monks]] based in the mountain valley near Tar Kuata. They are led by [[Menkha Helg]].
