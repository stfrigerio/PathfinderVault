> The mining village of **Baslwief** is located in the foothills of the eastern [[Fenwall Mountains]] in [[Varisia]], on the banks of the [[Sarwin River]].



## History

> Built beneath a fortress, Baslwief was chartered in [[4563 AR]] by Jayden Baslwief, a cartographer and surveyor from [[Harse]] who thought the open, flat riverbank would in the foothills of the Fenwall would make an excellent spot for a settlement. After receiving the charter from the [[Korvosa|Korvosan]] government, Jayden Baslwief brought out his friends and family to form the nucleus of the town's population.
> Baslwief was the first town to suffer the rage of the [[Red dragon|red dragon]] [[Glarataxus]] in [[4569 AR]] as well as several later rampages, though they were spared from his most recent attacks in [[4674 AR|4674]].


## Economy and defense

> Mining copper, [[Iron|iron]], and rarer [[Metal|metals]] from the foothills of the [[Fenwall Mountains]], Baslwief provides enough competition with [[Janderhoff]] to keep prices of raw materials in [[Korvosa]] fair. Baslwief has a relatively small militia to defend it, and depends on the much more militaristic town of [[Melfesh]] for protection.


## Inhabitants

> Compared to most other settlements in Varisia, the village sports a relatively large population of [[Halfling|halflings]] who find its frontier atmosphere appealing.
> Although not a true inhabitant of the town, the [[Cloud giant|cloud giant]] [[Seferin]] visits Baslwief every three years and challenges anyone to cook him the finest dish possible. The winning meal earns its chef a [[Jewel|jewel]] the size of a chicken egg; runners' up receive [[Platinum piece|platinum coins]].
