> **Elidir** (pronounced EL-eh-deer) is both the capital of [[Isger]] and the nation's largest city. Far from the [[Chitterwood]], Elidir escaped the worst of the [[Goblinblood Wars]], a fact that still engenders bitterness from those whose homes were overrun. It is a commonly held belief throughout the rest of the country that if the capital had been in greater danger during the war, the fighting would have been over much faster.



## Trade

> Elidir stands at the center of the important [[Conerica Straits]] trade route and is a popular stopping point for caravans. However, those traders who are not seeking to stop can easily bypass the city using its famous Rampways.

## Pathfinder Society

> Members of the [[Pathfinder Society]] meet secretly once a month at a temple of [[Erastil]] outside of town to discuss the Society's activities in Isger. They are particularly interested in the ancient sites of the extinct [[Isgeri]] tribes who were defeated by [[Taldor|Taldors]] [[Seventh Army of Exploration]] in [[2133 AR]]. Since such activity is against the wishes of Isger's [[Cheliax|Chelish]] masters, the Pathfinders must conduct all of their activities in secret.
