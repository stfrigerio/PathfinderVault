> **Avendale** is the capital city of [[Touvette]]. [[Cabol Voran|General Cabol Voran]] took over after the death of the king, removing all temples from the city after driving out all the priests. The city was once dominated by a variety of faiths who filled the power vacuum left by a weak and incompetent king. These new faiths engaged in holy wars that further weakened the kingdom. With the coming of Cabol Voran this ended, he banished the priests from his capital and the entire nation. Now all of Avendale's temples have been converted in to "charities" equal parts orphanages, schools, hospitals and government work centres that serve the city's people.
