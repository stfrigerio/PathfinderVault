> **Zradnirras** is a ruined city along the [[Myrfrus River]] in eastern [[Iobaria]]. Once a powerful city for both the [[Cyclops|cyclopes]] of [[Koloran]] and the [[Humans|humans]] of Iobaria, housing the legendary [[Zradnirri Arcolleges]], the city is now now a [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Goblin|goblin]]- and [[Kobold|kobold]]-plagued ruin. These savage [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Humanoid|humanoids]] worship a family clutch of [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dragon|dragons]] who hunt both the city, and the nearby [[Deeprun Crevasse]] for prey.
