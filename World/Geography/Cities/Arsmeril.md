> The cliff-side [[Elf|elven]] village of **Arsmeril** can be found where the northwestern [[Mierani Forest]] meets the [[Steaming Sea]]. Along with the settlement of [[Crying Leaf]], it is the only elven settlement in [[Varisia]], and like its companion on the far side of the Mierani, it is an outpost of the elven nation of [[Kyonin]] who wish to keep a closer eye on the ruins of [[Celwynvian]].
