> The [[Cheliax|Chelish]] town of **Kantaria** stands just west of the [[Sedna River]], between the [[Barrowood]] and the [[Menador Mountains]] to the north. It is the capital of the [[Archduchy of Menador]].



## Economy

> Kantaria is the only settlement of note in the region. It relies upon trade of minerals and [[Slavery|slaves]] from the mountains, merchant caravans, and shadow-masters from [[Nidal]] traveling to [[Egorian]].
> Rumours speak of a nomadic group of escaped slaves being led along the [[Jeni River]] by a woman known only as Alessa, who might be the last scion of an almost-forgotten noble family that once ruled Kantaria. Although [[House Napaciza]] has sent its best trackers and House Narikopolus its renowned archers to locate this woman, she has thus far eluded capture, and House Narikopolus will not confirm her potentially noble birth.


## Government

> The town and archduchy is ruled by [[House Narikopolus]], which was loyal to [[House Thrune]] during the [[Chelish Civil War]]. The House has maintained its rule over Menador since the 3800s [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]].


## History

> The [[Mortal|mortal]] [[Iomedae]] ruled the city of Kantaria for a year and a day while it was under siege, successfully defending it. This event was so important that it is recorded in Iomedae's canon as the Tenth Act of the eleven *[[Acts of Iomedae]]*.


> [[Paizo]] published a major article about Kantaria in *[[Wrath of Thrune]]*, and the town is the adventure's setting.
