> The **Monolith Glacier** lies at the very north-western corner of the [[Thanelands]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]; it is formed in the western reaches of the high [[Stormspear Mountains]] range and is slowly moving southwards. The Monolith Glacier has a distinct, very symmetrical oblong shape and those few brave explorers who have ventured up onto the glacier report seeing a large fortress entombed within the very heart of the glacier. Monolith Glacier is a very dangerous place to explore: blizzards often engulf it; its surface is riddled with crevasses and ice tunnels created by the numerous deadly [[Remorhaz|remorhazes]] that make their home in the depths of the glacier. Unbeknownst to everyone, the glacier is actually alive, a sentient [[Elemental|elemental]] that speaks with a voice of grinding ice and might be willing to allow access to the strange structure at its heart to anyone who can rid it of the pesky remorhazes infesting it.
