*For another meaning of "Skywatch", please see Skywatch (Starfall).*
> The city of **Skywatch** grew up around a massive [[Observatory|observatory]] high in the [[Icerime Peaks]] on [[Brevoy|Brevoys]] eastern border.



## The observatory

> The observatory is older than any known settlement in the region, and its origins and purpose remain a mystery. The ancient structure was obviously built to accommodate beings much larger than [[Human|humans]], and it has been preserved through the ages by powerful [[Magic|magic]]. Who built the ancient structure and why is as yet unknown.


## History


### Early history

> The city of Skywatch began as a simple outpost, built by [[House Surtova]], around the observatory during the early years of [[Issia|Issias]] history. This fortification was overtaken by the [[Aldori swordlords|Aldori]] during Issia's constant war with neighboring [[Rostland]], and it served as an Aldori stronghold even after [[Choral the Conqueror]] brought both nations to their knees and united them under his rule.
> A few years later, however, Choral and his [[Red dragon|red dragon]] allies put an end to the Aldori separatists at Skywatch, burning the fortress to the ground. Choral then showed a great deal of interest in the observatory and began excavating and researching the mysterious observatory after the Aldori defeat and built the modern city of Skywatch atop the original settlement's burnt ruins. After his departure, [[House Rogarvia]] took over the endeavour on Choral's behalf. The goals and any results from this examination of the observatory are unknown.


### Recent history

> Strangely, on the same day in [[4699 AR]] that every member of House Rogarvia disappeared, Skywatch sealed itself off from all outsiders, including supply caravans. Since that day, no message sent to Skywatch has received a response and even powerful [[Magic/Divination|divination]] magic fails to penetrate the city's ancient walls.
> For years, mages and scholars have attempted to bypass the seal but were wholly unsuccessful. Very recently, however, the wards mysteriously disappeared and the city gates opened. The first outsiders who explored the city found its homes and streets well-kept and recently cared for, yet no living person remained within its walls. The only clue were footprints that led out of Skywatch, but who left them and where they went, remain unknown.
