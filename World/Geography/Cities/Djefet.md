> **Djefet** is a small town on the [[River Sphinx]] of [[Osirion]] that bears a terrible [[Curse|curse]]. At first glance, it looks like many other Osirian towns with reed-and-wood homes built on stone foundations, but this is where the similarities end. All of Djefet's residents bear a curse that causes their skin to turn ash-colored as they enter adulthood and then wrinkle and wither away. Residents who try to escape Djefet find that their paths inevitably always turn back to the town and are never able to escape. Legend tells of an [[Artifact|artifact]] in the [[Pillars of the Sun]] that could put an end to the curse, but none of the residents have ever been able to leave to verify the validity of this claim.


## Trade

> Outsiders still trade with the residents on the wharfs of Djefet, but refuse to enter the town because of the curse.
