> **Kmlin-Bru** is the second-largest [[Dero|dero]] town in [[Nar-Voth]] after [[Corgunbier]]. Here they inhabit the dungeons and tunnels of a complex that predates even [[Earthfall]]. The inhabitants are unusually organised and militaristic, especially for the chaotic dero.


## Geography

> The corridors connect directly to the notorious [[Dread Dungeons]] of Galtcreed above, and many of the inhabitants of Kmlin-Bru serve [[Bremovir|Primarch Bremovier]] of [[Galt]] as jailers and torturers. It is said that some of the cells are infested with the hazardous fungus [[Cytillesh|cytillesh]], also known as brain mould.


## Government

> The dero are ruled by a female savant named [[Mirgik]] who maintains good relations with the Galtese above to secure a steady supply of victims for her insane experiments, and for other reasons which have yet to be revealed.
