> **Eastgate**, a [[City districts of Absalom|city district]] of [[Absalom]], lies in the far eastern border of the walled city, surrounded by the [[Petal District]] to the north, [[The Coins]] to the west, and the [[Precipice Quarter]] to the south. Eastgate is an almost entirely residential district, and many of its largely working class inhabitants commute to other parts of the city for their employment, even though the travel time to the most distant parts of the city can take up to two hours. The district as a whole is quiet and orderly, in some part due to its [[Nomarch|nomarch]]â€”[[Ayunga|Lord Ayunga]] of House Akkeshâ€”also being the captain of the local guard.
