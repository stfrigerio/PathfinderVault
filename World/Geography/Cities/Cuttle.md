> **Cuttle** is a small settlement on the west coast of [[Mediogalti Island]]. It is much smaller and much less known than the island's main settlement of [[Ilizmagorti]].
> It consists of a collection of huts on the edge of the beach and serves as a way station for the whalers of the [[Arcadian Ocean]]. The whalers pay the [[Red Mantis]] for the use of the site, normally in the form of whale oil, and it is believed that some of the villagers are probably Red Mantis members. The whalers resupply here and also render the catches.
