> **Crowstump** is a port town at the mouth of the [[Tourondel River]] where it enters [[Lake Encarthan]]. It serves as a waypoint for [[Mendevian Crusades|Mendevian Crusaders]] due to its proximity to southern [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] and lively selection of taverns, but is also known as a regional center of academia, trade market, and relatively peaceful settlement in a chaotic region.



## Geography

> Crowstump rings a small but deep harbor of western Lake Encarthan and extends about half a mile inland. Groves of the [[Fangwood]] are north and south of the town, with roads leading into the woods as well as a road off to the west.
> The town includes many taverns, the walled Willow Keep, the Wood Lodge near the center of town, and a small academy of [[Magic|magic]] near the town's edge.


## Government

> [[Samar Tyn|Mayor Samar Tyn]] was elected by town elders representing craft and trade guilds. In his campaign, Tyn promised to improve trade with Lastwall and ports on Lake Encarthan. [[Tamin Westiron|Captain Tamin Westiron]] represents Lastwall as a peacekeeper for Mendevian Crusaders visiting the town's taverns on their way to [[Mendev]], particularly the [[Gilded Orc]] and [[Thirsty Owlbear]].


## History

> Crowstump was founded as a supply stockade for the Shining Crusade during their battle against the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]]. Its name is inspired by the crows who cawed at the first settlers to chop down trees for the stockade, a behavior the birds still exhibit.


## People

> Renowned scholar [[Nathar Arod]], who specializes in the history of Lake Encarthan and its surrounding region, calls Crowstump his home.


> [[Paizo]] published a map of Crowstump on page 22 of *[[Lands of Conflict]]*.
