> **Rolgrimmdur** is built among the ruins of [[Grakodan]] by [[Khadon|Khadons]] [[Engineer|engineers]], and is now one of the most fortified [[Dwarf|dwarven]] cities in [[Five Kings Mountains]]. It is located about 50 miles southwest of the capital city of [[Highhelm Militia]].


## Defenses

> Most of the city's defenses are located underground, protecting it from any intrusions from the [[Darklands]] below. Above ground, a tall gatehouse overlooks the eastern part of the city as well as the pass between Rolgrimmdur and the neighboring city of Highhelm.


## Warrior philosophy

> The city has a warrior-based [[Philosophy|philosophy]] because it was re-founded by soldiers. Dwarven children here study combat before they can read. Many [[Human|human]] military officers come to the city to study warfare. Despite this military focus, Rolgrimmdur is not overly aggressive, preferring to supply trained troops both domestically and abroad. Mercenaries and siege weapons from Rolgrimmdur are exported to the fortresses of the Five Kings Mountains but also to the nations of [[Druma]] and [[Andoran]].
