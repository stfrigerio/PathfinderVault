> The small, coastal fishing town of **Albatross** perches precariously on a cliffside off the coast of [[Nidal]] on [[Conqueror's Bay|Conquerors Bay]]. Although it is a settlement of less than 400 souls, it is home to many times that number of its namesake avians. Residents of Albatross claim to be able to predict the weather, foretell ill omens, and see the approach of death simply by observing and interpreting the flights of these [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|birds]].
