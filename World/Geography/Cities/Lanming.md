> **Lanming** is the rowdy capital of [[Quain]], in southern [[Tian Xia]], and home to the nation's temples and government. Its heroes often demolish property while testing themselves and each other in its bustling streets, to such a point that tradesfolk have a well-known saying about the city: "To grow rich, move to Lanming."
