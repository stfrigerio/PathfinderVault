> **Orjotoro** is a city located in eastern [[Xopatl]], where the Limardero River flows into the [[Follower's River|Followers River]]. It is home to the merchant's guild that monitors imports and exports between Xopatl, [[Razatlan]], and [[Innazpa]] via Follower's River, and sees constant traffic from [[Boat|boats]] picking up and delivering goods. It is the central city of the three Follower's Rests on the river that serve as trade checkpoints along its length.
