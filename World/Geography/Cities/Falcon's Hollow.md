>  **Falcon's Hollow** is a town in [[Darkmoon Vale]], in the nation of [[Andoran]]. The settlement sits only a short distance from [[Darkmoon Wood]] and is little more than a logging village, comprised almost exclusively of lumbermen in the employ of the [[Lumber Consortium]] and their families. With few exceptions, the buildings and their inhabitants belong to the Consortium and totally depend on the overpriced goods delivered by the organization.
>  It is said that in times long past [[dwarves]] settled in the surroundings of Falcon's Hollow; rumors persist that forgotten treasures of their fallen civilization yet remain to be found. Yet today it is a place for the desperate with no other place to go, for outcasts and religious zealots seeking to avoid hindrances brought on by their surroundings.



## History

>  Falcon's Hollow is the third in a line of logging towns to exist in Darkmoon Vale, each built to harvest the region's rich supplies of [[darkwood]] and other lumbers until the forests had depleted beyond a reasonable distance from the towns' relative safety. The town was founded during the tenureship of [[General Khastalus]] during the early 18th century [[AR]].
>  Falcon's Hollow was founded by three families: the stern and silent [[Larkos]], the brave [[Samkils]], and the brutal [[Kreeds]]. These bone-hard folk weathered the Harpy-Hag Massacre of [[4603 AR]], finally ending the war by marrying a Larko son off to one of the [[Hag]] [[Ulizmila's]] many daughters.
>  The period from [[4631 AR]] to [[4641 AR]] is known as the Misery in Falcon's Hollow's history. A entire generation of the three founding families was murdered by an [[Attic whisperer]]. [[Balkri Kreed]] promptly dismembered the attic whisperer responsible but not before she lost her son [[Talin]].
>  The last descendant of the Samkils, the young [[Jebrika]], was killed during the Hobgoblin Strife of [[4679 AR]]. Some people say that he was actually killed by [[Thalsin Kreed]]. In [[4701 AR]], the Falcon's Feud was ended with the mass burning of the [[Larko clan]], most of whom had become "unnatural folk", [[changelings]] or worse, due to their ties to the hags of the Vale's deepest wilds. The eradication of the Larkos left [[Thuldrin Kreed]] and his son [[Jurin]] the only surviving descendants of the three founding families, and the only owners of the region's Lumber Consortium chopping rights.


## Geography

 
 Falcon's Hollow Map
>  Falcon's Hollow is located a short distance south of Darkmoon Wood, and many of the inhabitants of the community work as loggers within the forest's confines in the employ of the Lumber Consortium; roads radiating from the town often lead to lumber camps operating on the edge of the treeline. The volcano [[Droskar's Crag]] dominates the skyline to the northwest, and its presence is felt throughout the region in the form of mudpots, geysers, and areas of past lava flow.
>  The [[River Foam]] acts as the southern boundary of Falcon's Hollow, as it passes southeast through the [[Darkmoon Plain]]. The settlement boasts the flow's only ferry, a fact that helps secure the Consortium's hold on the region as currently no bridges span the river to provide other means of easy passage.


## Government

>  Life in Falcon's Hollow revolves around the harvesting of darkwood, and as such the Lumber Consortium holds sway over the community; the Consortium's primary representative in the area, Thuldrin Kreed, maintains control of the region by denying goods and services through means other than those he allows. Firmly believing his hold on the town to be complete, Kreed has no qualms against exploiting his power and position for personal gain, often at the expense of the citizenry. However, dissent does exist. Both Magistrate [[Vamros Harg]] and Sheriff [[Deldrin Baleson]] would like to see Kreed removed from his position of authority.
>  Harg conducts official business from the Hollow Tribunal, an ironic name given the corrupt nature of the town's "justice". The magistrate issues merchant licenses, stamps mining and lumber claims, and rules on both criminal and civil cases.


## Economy

>  Falcon's Hollow is one of the oldest logging communities in Andoran; the town is run by the Lumber Consortium, and lumberjacks from the community always make an appearance at the annual [[Great Andoran Fair]], in the capital city of [[Almas]]. Falcon's Hollow is also a popular location amongst [[adventurers]], who set out in search of riches rumored to remain hidden in the region's many dwarven ruins.


## Inhabitants

>  Most inhabitants of Falcon's Hollow are [[Human]], with the most notable exception being [[Halfling]] Magistrate Vamros Harg. Other notable personages of the town include Thuldrin Kreed, his right hand [[Payden "Pay Day" Teedum]], and Sheriff Deldrin Baleson.


## Locations

>  In a town like Falcon's Hollow there are few places of interest. Despite this, notable locations include the [[Hollow Tribunal]], the [[Lumber Consortium Headquarters]], and a small [[Temple of Iomedae]].
>  The majority of the locations in Falcon's Hollow play some role in the operations of the Lumber Consortium, or at the very least are owned by the Consortium and its personnel. However, several of these sites hold particular historical significance to the area or are of importance to several members of the town's citizenry.


### Hollow Tribunal

***Main article: [[Hollow Tribunal]]***
>  The Hollow Tribunal is the primary government building in the area, run by the halfling [[Vamros Harg]], Magistrate of Falcon's Hollow. Providing the community with general public services, as well as presiding over disputes and prosecutions, Harg is known to be controlled by agents of the Lumber Consortium; his decisions are often made in support of the Consortium's men and operations.


### Lumber Consortium Headquarters

***Main article: [[Lumber Consortium Headquarters]]***
>  This run-down building opens onto the [[High Market]], and has seen better days; once one of the town's more impressive structures, [[Thuldrin Kreed]] has been diverting funds to better his personal home and the Headquarters has suffered as a result. It usually remains vacant unless Kreed decides an official setting is warranted.


### Temple of Iomedae

***Main article: [[Temple of Iomedae (Falcon's Hollow)]]***
>  [[Lady Cirthana]] sees little support from the inhabitants of Falcon's Hollow, and her Temple and actions have been openly denounced by the Lumber Consortium. Despite this, she does what she can to serve those few who turn to [[Iomedae]] for guidance in life.


### The Cutyard

***Main article: [[Cutyard]]***
>  The Cutyard is the heart of Falcon's Hollow, where lumber crews work day and night under terrible conditions.


### Brookman's Well

***Main article: [[Brookman's Well]]***
>  A spring just north of the town that supplies most of the necessary fresh water.


### Abandoned Cutyard

***Main article: [[Abandoned Cutyard]]***
>  Falcon's Hollow's first lumber mill and surrounding log cabins which lie abandoned half a mile west of the town.


>  [[Paizo]] published a major article about Falcon's Hollow, including a map and gazetteer, in *[[Towns of the Inner Sea]]* Chapter 2.
