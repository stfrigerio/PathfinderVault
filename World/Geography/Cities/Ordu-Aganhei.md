> **Ordu-Aganhei**, the City at the Edge of the World, is the capital city of the nation of [[Hongal]] in northern [[Tian Xia]]. It is also only one of two major settlementsâ€”the other being [[Muliwan]]â€”in the whole country.
> While Ordu-Aganhei is technically the capital of Hongal, the ruler of Hongal spends little time there. Instead, the nation's khan also rules the nation's most powerful nomadic tribe, and wanders with them as the greatest [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horseback]] riding tribe. Traditionally, the ruler of Ordu-Aganhei is one of the khan of Hongal's brothers.
