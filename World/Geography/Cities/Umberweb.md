> **Umberweb** is a [[Drow|drow]] city of [[Sekamina]] far beneath the surface nation of [[Varisia]]. It is considered an outlying settlement, with native drow displaying slight differences in dress, accent, or mannerism compared to the inhabitants of the capital of [[Zirnakaynin]]. Of all the dark elven cities, Umberweb has the largest population of [[Drider|driders]]. Only here does one find sizeable populations of the much rarer female driders living in close proximity to full-blooded drow.


## History

> Ages ago, the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Yamasoth]] kidnapped drow from Umberweb and took them back to his lair in the cavern of [[Gongorina]] beneath [[Hollow Mountain]]. There he used them in his [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]] experiments, and although the [[Demon|demon]] returned to the [[Abyss]] long ago, his creations still live on.


## Outpost of High Ilvarandin

> The [[Intellect devourer|intellect devourers]] of [[High Ilvarandin]] are said to maintain a secret outpost in Umberweb. It serves as a base for local operations in that part of Sekamina, and as a waypoint as they travel between [[Orv]] and the surface.
