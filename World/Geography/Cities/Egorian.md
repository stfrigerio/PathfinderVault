> **Egorian** (pronounced eh-GOR-ee-an) became the capital of [[Cheliax]] upon the [[Thrune Ascendancy]] in [[4640 AR]], replacing the city of [[Westcrown]]. [[House Thrune]] wished to create a new imperial capital to honor its new allegiances far from the nobles and history of Westcrown. It is also known as the City of Thorns.



## History

> Throughout most of Egorian's early history, it was little more than a sleepy fishing village on the shores of [[Lake Sorrow]]. Only when first [[Taldor]] and later independent Cheliax rose to be the dominant power in the region did its fortunes rise, becoming the second most-important city after Westcrown. After the end of the [[Chelish Civil War]], [[Abrogail I|Queen Abrogail I]] moved the nation's capital from Westcrown to Egorian and instituted a major urban renewal program in order to re-imagine the city in a more orderly image.


## Geography

> The imperial capital sits on the southern banks of Lake Sorrow, where the [[Adivian River]] continues its meandering course to the south. Egorian's position on the lake grants it access to the connecting inland waterways of the [[Sedna River|Sedna]], [[Tomarsulk River|Tomarsulk]], and [[Jeni River|Jeni Rivers]], and the cities of [[Kantaria]], and [[Dekarium]].
> The city itself is a mismatched combination of two distinct architectural and design styles: the older, organic of Imperial Cheliax, and the newer, inflexible and autocratic [[Philosophy|philosophy]] of the [[Infernal|infernal]] House of Thrune.
> The newer sections are built in the gothic architectural style, with towers and minarets that are barbed or capped with sharply pointed conical roofs. The favoured construction material is a red-veined black marble imported from [[Arcadia]]. The expense of importing such material has been one of factors inhibiting further city development.
> Old Egorian appears far more welcoming to foreign traders and visitors. Temples not dedicated to [[Asmodeus]] are usually found in these districts.


## Districts

*For a complete list, see [[CategoryEgorianDistricts]].*
> Egorian is divided up to 23 official and unofficial districts. [[Cheapside]] is a catch-all term used by the upper classes of Egorian to describe any of the city's low-rent districts. These are the Riverside, the [[Devil's Dance|Devils Dance]], the [[Dice End]], the Bilgetown, the [[Trick Alley]], the [[Whipcrack]] and other districts. The upper-middle-class neighborhoods of the city are the Briarpatch, the [[Triumph]], the Parley Circle and other districts. The wealthiest districts of the city are the [[Hell Hound Hill]], the [[Long Market]], the Mireside, the Thorntown and others.


## Inhabitants

*See also: [[CategoryEgorianInhabitants]]*
> Egorian is one of the largest [[Halfling|halfling]] settlements in the [[Inner Sea region]], with most of the population held in [[Slavery|slavery]]. Halfling slaves are especially popular among Egorian nobles, and are derisively called *[[Slip|slips]]* by their owners. Egorian halflings are naturally much tougher, less happy, and less warm than halflings elsewhere, but are not afraid to take advantage of their masters where they can.


## Religion

> As the capital of Cheliax, Egorian is the heart of the faith of Asmodeus, and the largest concentration of his worshipers can be found there. They are led by [[Aspexia Rugatonn]], Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus. The [[Midnight Temple]] in Egorian is dedicated to Asmodeus, and [[Human|human]] sacrifices are made there upon the [[Black Altar]].
