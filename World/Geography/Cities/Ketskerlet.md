> **Ketskerlet** is the chief township of the [[Khorkii Clans]], built into the [[Wall of Heaven]] where the mountains meet the [[Gulf of Khorkii]]. The stone halls of Ketskerlet provide shelter for the [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] sailors during the cold winter months. Fully a third of its population is made up of [[Dwarf|dwarves]], who maintain the shelters during the summer.
