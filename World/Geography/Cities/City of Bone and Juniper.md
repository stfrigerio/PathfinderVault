> The **City of Bone and Juniper** is a [[Taiga giant|taiga giant]] settlement in the mountains of [[Zi Ha]] in [[Tian Xia]].
> The [[Giant|giants]] believe they are descendants of an [[Underworld dragon|underworld dragon]] and an ancient [[Samsaran|samsaran]] noble who sought to escape the cycle of rebirth to remain with her beloved. They keep the remains of their samsaran progenitor in a [[Gold|golden]] mausoleum on a hidden plateau marked by three towers made of wood and bone high in the mountains that happens to be located at the intersection of two ley lines, which provide the plateau special [[Magic|magical]] properties. Anyone who dares approach the mausoleum will be slain. The taiga giants spend most of the time dressed in red and black, but occasionally honor the samsaran noble by dressing in mottled blue and white. During the latter times they travel peacefully to the lowlands to trade with the [[Human|human]] and samsaran villagers, all the while maintaining a strict code of silence.
