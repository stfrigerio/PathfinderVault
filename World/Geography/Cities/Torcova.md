> **Torcova** is a small town in northwestern [[Taldor]] in the southwestern foothills of the [[Fog Peaks]] in [[Northern Tandak Prefecture]]. Outside of the town, lies the manor home of a local noble, Lord Sauton Beane, who hides a terrible secret. He is secretly an [[Ogrekin|ogrekin]], albeit a handsome one, who has gone through seven wives in the hopes of begetting a [[Human|human]] offspring. He has not succeeded so far, and has locked his monstrous progeny in a cave beneath his home after murdering their mothers. He only releases his ogrekin children to punish his enemies or kidnap his next wife.
