> A place that is nigh impregnable to its enemies, the city of **Skelt** is of strategic importance to the whole of [[Nirmathas]], being situated along the [[Shining River]], which flows into the [[Tourondel River]] in northern Nirmathas. The city is located atop a large bluff and is only accessible one of two ways: either by water-powered lifts, or by several ramps, each of which has multiple drawbridges that can be raised at a moment's notice. The main forms of industry in Skelt are mining and lumber. The ore mined from the depth of the earth is brought up by huge lifts powered by [[Dwarf|dwarf-crafted]] waterworks. These same waterworks also power the ore grinders that help refine the ore into usable metals. Lumber is also a big industry in Skelt, with sawmills dotting the Tourondel River for miles down-river.
> Skelt is heavily reliant on trade; for a long time it only traded with the nearby dwarf hold of [[Kraggodan]], but with the re-opening of the [[Bloodsworn Vale]] as a viable trade route, Skelt now has access to all [[Varisia]], particularly the large cities of [[Korvosa]] and [[Magnimar]].
