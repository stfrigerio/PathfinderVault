> The port city of **Egede** (pronounced eh-GEHD-eh) is located on the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]]. It is the second-largest city in the [[Mendev]], and as the end of the [[River Road]], is the first Mendevian city that most crusaders entered during the period of the [[Mendevian Crusades]].
> From Egede, trade from neighbouring nations (in particular [[Brevoy]], since the recent fall of [[House Rogarvia]]) usually flows into Mendev, as did crusaders traveling from the south through the [[River Kingdoms]] and [[Numeria]]. During the Mendevian Crusades, exhausted soldiers were often sent to Egede for much needed rest and relaxation, whether that was for prayer at the temples or a trip to the covert brothels and bawdy houses that thrived there. A great deal of work was also done here in support of the war effort, often by travelers thoroughly bankrupted by unscrupulous merchants on their way to the crusades.
> The growth of industry, trade, and business proved helpful to the crusaders' cause, but some have begun to worry that the city is becoming a den of sin and debauchery.
