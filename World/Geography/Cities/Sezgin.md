## History

> Sezgin was founded as a chÃ¢teau and hunting lodge. In [[4424 AR]], the merchant [[Marstead Vizcarra]] overthrew the local lord, Igan Varklein, who was discovered to hunt [[Humanoid|humanoid]] [[Slavery|slaves]] for his and his patrons' amusement. 
> Vizcarra built and improved the roads, linking the villages of the area to the rest of the realm. In [[4449 AR]], he also built the [[Raven Bridge]] across the Tolemaida River to link Sezgin to [[Daggermark]]. Over the years, the [[Vizcarra family]] set up tanneries outside the town, and built Sezgin's reputation for fine leatherworking and as a center for the fur trade in river marten, otter, and beaver.
> [[Sanger Vizcarra]] is the elected mayor of Sezgin, travelling to [[Maashinelle]] only upon matters of importance.
