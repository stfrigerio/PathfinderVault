> **Rapier Bay** is a rowdy small town on [[Motaku Isle]] in the [[Shackles]]. It is led by the [[Pirate lord|pirate lord]] [[Maxevale Janis]], captain of the [[Ship|galleon]] *[[Motaku Maiden]]*. Maxevale always supports [[Tessa Fairwind|Lady Tessa]] in the [[Pirate Council]], earning the nickname "the Puppy", though no man dares to say it to his face. 
> Rapier Bay is not a busy harbor like [[Quent]], but is used by [[Pirate|pirates]] who do not want to draw much attention to themselves while sailing near the island. Rapier Bay is famous for one of its smithies, the [[Steel-Clad Giant]], that makes some of the finest [[Weapon|blades]] west of the [[Arch of Aroden]].
