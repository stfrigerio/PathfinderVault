> **Nivakta's Crossing** is a village at the very southern edge of [[Rostland]] situated on the northern bank of the [[Shrike River]] and overlooking the [[Stolen Lands]] of the [[River Kingdoms]] to its south.


## Description

> The village is protected by a wooden palisade wall surrounding it. The South Rostland Road runs through the village, as does the road leading to the newly established settlement at [[Varnhold]]. This latter road crosses a low, fortified bridge across the Shrike.


## Inhabitants

> The town is home to trappers, anglers, hunters and tradesmen. The locals are a serious bunch and very suspicious of strangers especially those from the south, *i.e.*, the Stolen Lands.
> Senior inhabitants include:

> - Lord Mayor Irven Revanisu
> - Sheriff Lorin Kaven
> - Abbot Kara Ilarenika, [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Pharasma]]
