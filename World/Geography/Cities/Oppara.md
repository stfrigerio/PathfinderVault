> **Oppara**, **the City of Empire**, (pronounced oh-PAH-rah) is the capital of [[Taldor]], and by far the largest city in the realm. It is an ancient and thriving city which earned the title **the Gilded City** because of the many roofs, spires, and domes that once glittered with [[Gold|gold]] plating in the high afternoon [[Sun|sun]]. Even though the metal was long ago stripped away, Oppara remains the example of what the empire once was and what it could be again, though, today, it is plagued with mismanagement, selfish [[Aristocrat|aristocrats]], poverty, and crime.



## History

> Oppara was founded before [[Aroden|Arodens]] [[Ascension|ascension]] as a [[God|god]] and considers itself the source of civilization for all of [[Avistan]]. It was already in existence when [[Taldaris]], a native of Oppara and the first [[Grand Prince]] of Taldor, conquered the local city-states along the eastern shores of the [[Inner Sea]] to found that nation.
> The Gilded City, with its tremendously long history, is no stranger to tragedy. One of the earliest came in [[-632 AR]], when the infamous [[Tarrasque]] broke through the [[World's Edge Mountains|Worlds Edge Mountains]] and destroyed the city.
> Following the ascension of the [[Deity|deity]] Aroden in [[1 AR]], and the creation of the city of [[Absalom]], the new god of [[Human|humanitys]] faith quickly spread in Taldor, and Oppara quickly became the center of his worship.


## Construction

> The dominant building materials of Oppara are stone, marble, granite, and bricks. Six thousand years of history and the extravagance of the empire's capital are obvious in the city's design. The streets are paved in grandiose mosaic tiles or well-laid cobblestones. Stone gutters quickly siphon off the frequent summer rains into the city's expansive sewer system. Public fountains dot many of the larger crossroads and squares. The city is lit by tens of thousands of lanterns at night.


## Geography

> Oppara is located atop the Black Cliffs of the [[River Porthmos|Mighty Porthmos]], thirty miles upriver from the enormous mouth of the river that flows into the [[Inner Sea]]. The massive [[Grand Bridge of the Empire]] connects Oppara with the river's distant southern shore. The deep Porthmos is full of [[Ship|shipping]] traffic.


### City districts

***Main article: [[City districts of Oppara]]***
> Oppara is divided into fifteen distinct districts, each with its own flavor and characteristics. A sixteenth district, called [[Grandbridge Vagabond Camp]], is located on the south shore of Porthmos River, and not usually considered part of Oppara. The dominant characteristic of Oppara's city plan is the [[Central Canal]] that forms a fork with its center in the middle of the city and its three branches extending from there towards the edges of the city. The northeastern and northwestern branches go through its walls and beyond. The southern branch ends in the Porthmos River. The Central Canal divides Oppara into three areas.
> The [[Lionsgate district|Lionsgate]] district is hedged in by the two northern branches of Central Canal and it is mainly a market district. 
> The western part of the city is divided into the [[Imperial Square]] district, where the [[Imperial Palace]] is located; the [[Memorial Park]] district; the [[Seven Towers]] district, where the ancient [[Azlant|Azlanti]] settlement of Oppara was founded; the [[Aroden's View|Arodens View]], [[Senate's Hill|Senates Hill]], and [[Worldbreaker Hill]] districts, which are located on the western hills of the city, on top of the Black Cliffs; the wealthy district of [[Westpark]]; a part of the large mercantile [[Grandbridge]] district, from which the Grand Bridge of the Empire emerges to connect Oppara with the river's distant southern shore; and the large [[Westport]] dock district. 
> The eastern part of the city is divided into the [[Crownsgate district|Crownsgate]] district; the residential [[Canal Row]] district; the poor and dangerous [[Narrows]] district; the eastern part of the Grandbridge district; and the [[Eastport]] dock district. 
> The fortified [[Jadrishar Island]] just off the western coast of Oppara, forms one more district which is occupied by the [[Taldan Imperial Navy|Imperial Navy]].


## Organizations

> A number of local guilds and organizations have been established in the city. These include the [[Lighters' Guild|Lighters Guild]], which lights the tens of thousands of lanterns at night; the [[Oppara's Constabulary|Opparas Constabulary]], that keeps the city safe; and the [[Porthmos Militia]], which keeps watch on [[Westport]] at night. The city is also home to the [[Brotherhood of Silence]], the biggest and most important thieves' guild in the [[Inner Sea region]] and the Platinum Band, a tight-knit group who revere the god [[Apsu]].
> Oppara is home to two renowned [[Bard|bardic]] schools, the [[Kitharodian Academy]] and the [[Rhapsodic College]], as well as the oldest known temple of [[Aroden]], the [[Basilica of the Last Man]].
> Oppara's premier association of [[Abjurer|abjurers]] and [[Diviner|diviners]] is known as the First Imperial Arcanists' Guild and is led by Guildmaster Adula Stetsico.


### Military

> The headquarters of Taldor's military organizations—the [[Taldan Phalanx]], [[Taldan Horse]], Taldan Imperial Navy, [[River Guard]], [[Ulfen Guard]], and the mysterious [[Lion Blades]]—are also located in Oppara.


### International organizations

> The [[Pathfinder Society]] is interested in ancient Taldor's treasures, and the Society has established a [[Oppara Lodge|Pathfinder lodge]] in Oppara, as have their main rivals in the Inner Sea region, the [[Aspis Consortium]].


## Recent controversy

> Thieves in Oppara have begun using [[Aklys|aklyses]] to hobble fleeing victims, a [[Weapon|weapon]] that had previously been only used by the [[Darklands|Darklands-dwelling]] [[Dero|dero]].
