> Founded in [[4536 AR]] by Sarwin Harse, the town of **Harse** is an important gateway between [[Korvosa|Korvosas]] inland holdings and its seaward settlements. Positioned at the junction of the [[Sarwin River|Sarwin]] and [[Falcon River|Falcon Rivers]], the town's twin ferries provide the easiest means of crossing both rivers for travelers in the area.
> The town is built on a narrow strip of land between the Sarwin and Falcon rivers, and has been a river crossing since the time before the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] arrived. It contains only a few dozen buildings, including a church of [[Erastil]], two grocers, and two taverns (the Spotted Pony, and the Nag Bag). Most of the inhabitants do not live in the village proper, but on isolated farms and ranches spread about the local countryside. The town is known for its [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]] and livestock breeding, and holds a large rodeo at the Harse Market each year to determine [[Varisia|Varisias]] top riders and animals.
