> The town of **Sturnidae** is found in the south of the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Barstoi]], very close to the blasted wasteland known as [[The Furrows|theÂ Furrows]]. Its proximity to the Furrows is never forgotten as, when the wind blows aright, a pall of grey ash from the wasteland is blown over the town; it lands on the fields tainting the crops and the food with decay. Furthermore, locals report seeing visions of the war in the clouds of dust, such as marching peasant soldiers and charging [[Knight|knights]].


## History

> The infamous serial murderer, [[Dr D]], visited Sturnidae and killed a local butcher on 17 [[Pharast]] [[4594 AR]].


## The Margrave of Sturnidae

> The town is traditionally ruled by the Margrave of Sturnidae, a title held by the [[Knight|knightly]] [[House Graydon]]; however, the present Margrave, [[Cilas Graydon]], is currently in exile in [[Lozeri]]. Graydon was convicted of treason by [[Aericnein Neska|Count Neska of Barstoi]] in the latter stages of the [[War Without Rivals]] for denouncing Neska as a tyrant.
