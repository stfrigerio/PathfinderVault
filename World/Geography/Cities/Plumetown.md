> **Plumetown** is the only major settlement on the [[Smoker|island of the Smoker]] in the [[Shackles]]. [[Willa Cloudbuster]] is the *de facto* mayor of the town, and oversees Plumetown's sometimes impatient and disruptive visitors with a small army of constables: former [[Pirate|pirates]] who carry massive [[Club|clubs]]. The entire town seems designed solely to house, feed and entertain its visitors who seek the wisdom of the mysterious soothsayers, [[Keeba's Eyes|Keebas Eyes]], living in the caverns of [[Mount Keeba]]. It boasts a large number of taverns, hostels, gaming houses, and brothels.
