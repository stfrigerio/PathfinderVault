> The small town of **Bosorka** lies on the [[Frozen Road River]], in the southeast corner of [[Irrisen|Irrisens]] [[Feyfrost]] province. As with many towns along the Frozen Road River its main purpose is to assist those conveying goods and traveling down the river. It is located within sight of the border with the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], and therefore of a land not eternally dominated by the ravages of winter. No non-[[Jadwiga]] are allowed to cross the border out of Irrisen and the Jadwiga guards of Bosorka have to be ever vigilant with the border so plainly visible and enticing.
