> **Prada Hanam** is a small port city on the eastern coast of the nation of [[Jalmeray]]. The settlement's defining feature is the [[Murmur Dome of Prada Hanam]], an enormous, multi-building structure that suddenly appeared in the town centuries ago.


## History

> In [[2821 AR]], Prada Hanam was an ordinary Jalmeri fishing village on the edge of the [[Obari Ocean]]. One morning the villagers awoke to find that a huge building had appeared overnight. It contained a central, large dome structure with four octagonal towers twice the size of the dome surrounding it. Inside they found little to explain the building's mysterious nature. The central dome's interior was a single chamber with tiled floors, while the towers contained staircases that led to a single room at the top in which a solitary window faced east. In the countless centuries that followed the presence of the strange structure caused the village to expand to a small city, even though no one could fully explain the mystery of the Murmur Dome. Some [[Adventurer|adventurers]] claim to have explored a spiraling maze beneath the Dome, but all who have done so have died from a strange [[Diseases of Golarion|disease]] or [[Curse|curse]] that turned their flesh to stone and their bones to [[Iron|iron]].
