> **Anactoria** is a settlement in the rural inland of the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Caliphas]] on the banks of the [[Droa River]] and south of the [[Albria Woods]].
> The village is famous across Ustalav for the [[Maid of Anactoria]]: a corpse that was found in the local bogs in an incredibly well-preserved state despite its great age, which is now displayed in one of the village's cottages. The locals make their living cutting peat which is sent all around Ustalav as a cheap fuel.
