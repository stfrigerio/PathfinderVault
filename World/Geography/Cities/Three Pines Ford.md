> **Three Pines Ford** is a sizable town nestled on the [[Tourondel River]] of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], east of the forest of [[Fangwood]], and directly on its border with [[Nirmathas]]. It serves as a meeting-place for Lastwall officials and fresh recruits from Nirmathas. Heroes of Nirmathas use Three Pines Ford as a hiding place from agents of [[Molthune]], due to the town's close proximity to the Nirmathi border.


## Name

> The name of the town is said to derive from three [[Dryad|dryads]] trees. Although the [[Fey|fey]] sisters have remained unseen for a century, the townsfolk believe the legend is true and forbid anyone from harming those trees in any way.
