> **Crystalhurst** is a secretive town in the [[Southern Fangwood]] ruled by a circle of [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] who make sure the homes and other structures of the town blend in with the natural landscape. The druids willingly help the [[Nirmathas|Nirmathi]] repel Molthuni invaders, now that their previous central concern, the fight against the [[Darkblight]], was ended with the fall of the debased [[Fey|fey]] ruler [[Arlantia]] in [[4717 AR]].



## Geography

> The town is hidden inside the [[PathfinderWiki/Fangwood|Southern Fangwood]], about 15 miles north of the [[Marideth River]]. The small lake in the center of town has two small islands, one of which hosts the Gathering Hall. A stone-ringed clearing in the center of town is called The Unbroken, and curving roads spiral in and out of the town from the surrounding forest.


## Government

> Crystalhurst is governed by a council of druids who guard the town from outside knowledge, deter visitors they deem unworthy, and aid Nirmathas in its war against [[Molthune]] mostly because they believe Molthune will harvest the forest. They have recently allied themselves with the [[Fey|fey queen]] [[Gendowyn]] and her [[Accressiel Court]], as the two share the desire to remove leftover pockets of the Darkblight from the Fangwood.


## People

> The town's druids, including council [[Aspen Zora|Archdruid Aspen Zora]], are researching a cure to the [[Darkblight]] that still affects pockets of the [[Fangwood]]. Hallkeeper Ceroneth keeps the town's records and the Gathering Hall. Druids are welcome regardless of their race or ethnicity, making Crystalhurst one of Nirmathas's most diverse towns..
