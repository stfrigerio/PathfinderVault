> The [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of **Remesiana** stands at the mouth of the [[Iseld River]], where it flows out of the [[Whisperwood]] into the [[Bay of Solva]] and the [[Inner Sea]]. The [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]] of the [[Order of the Nail]] were based at nearby Citadel Draythe, before moving to [[Varisia]] at the urging of [[Domina Arabasti|Queen Domina]] of [[Korvosa]] in [[4682 AR]]. Like much of the southern coast of Cheliax, Remesiana is considered a stronghold of the old noble families who survived the [[Chelish Civil War]]. They now fight desperately to remain in the crown's good graces as they see their hereditary powers ebbing away.


## History

> Remesianan rebels fighting the oppression of [[House Thrune]] once plotted to assassinate [[Abrogail Thrune II|Queen Abrogail]], but were stopped in their attempt when the [[Angel|angel]] they believed was guiding them turned out to be an [[Erinys|erinys]] in disguise.
