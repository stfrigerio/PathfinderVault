> **Raliscrad** was a city located at the confluence of the [[Sarkora River|Sarkora]] and Isk Rivers in the region of the [[Sarkoris Scar]] (formerly the [[Worldwound]]) known as the [[Riftshadow]].


## History

> In the days of [[Old Sarkoris]], Raliscrad was a prosperous settlement on one of the most heavily trafficked waterways in the region whose [[Kellid]] inhabitants worshiped both the [[Green Faith]] and [[Pharasma]]. Soon after the opening of the Worldwound in [[4606 AR]], it was abandoned in a hurry, so much so that its citizens left much of their accumulated wealth behind.
> It remained a thriving city under [[Demon|demonic]] control, achieving a population of over 5,000 inhabitants. Unlike most of the other cities of the Worldwound, Raliscrad had a significant [[Human|human]] population who were willing to work under their demonic overlord, the [[Lilitu|lilitu]] Minagho.
