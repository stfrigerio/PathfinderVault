> **Rozenport** is a bustling town located in the south-west of the county of [[Versex]] in [[Ustalav]] perched high on the steep cliffs above the [[Danver River]]. The town is most famous as the seat of the [[Sincomakti School of Sciences]] founded in [[4570 AR]]. Many of the buildings of the town mirror the archaic architectural style of the world-renowned school, for instance, pointed steeples and manor houses topped with flat roofs. The town hall boasts a dome shaped like a bubble. All this is set within a veritable maze of roads and thoroughfares.
