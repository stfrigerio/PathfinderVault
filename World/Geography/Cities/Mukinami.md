> **Mukinami** was once a free city where people from the four provinces that make up modern [[Shokuro]] could meet and trade freely. Now, it serves as the capital of the recently formed nation. The nation's ruler, the [[Shokuro Toriaka|Sun Shogun]], governs from the city but in order to try and assuage the former nobility of the realm, he takes advice from a quarrelsome group called the [[Four Pillars]]â€”a quartet of aristocratic families that previously ruled Shokuro's four provinces.
