> **Wait's Span** is the name of a tiny hamlet next to a wooden bridge of the same name that sits near the southeastern shore of [[Lake Kavapesta]] in the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] province of [[Ulcazar]]. It is located only six miles east of the [[Monastery of the Veil]], and was the site of a massive fire that destroyed most of the village. Although Bishop Senir of the Monastery claims this was a natural event, most locals believe otherwise.
