> **Hallein Town** is a small [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] settlement located on the [[Path River]] downstream of [[Vigil]]. Situated at the foot of a high tarn rising from the shores of Lake Hallensee, access to it by land is almost impossible. Hallein Town is the home of the workers for the [[Salt|salt]] mines in the [[Virlych]] hills of nearby [[Ustalav]], and provides vital trade goods for the rest of the nation.


## History

> In previous generations, salt was transported by mule along the river. This route was eventually abandoned because of [[Kaltia]], a vile [[Undead|undead]] [[Dwarf|dwarf]] who returns to the nearby hills during the winter months to menace the salt-bearers. Despite being slain several times, Kaltia continues her haunts unabated.
