> **Fort Holiday** is a refuge built by the marooned survivors of [[Raptor Island]] in the [[Shackles]]. It is located atop a rocky hill of the island, at the fork of the [[Broken Hope River]] and its main tributary. It consists of a number of huts surrounded by a wooden palisade.
> The castaways continue to strengthen the palisade of their small refuge with stones and welcome any new survivors who can make it to the gates of Fort Holiday.
