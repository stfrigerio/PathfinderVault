**Avennara** is an [[Elf|elf]] village, located near the western edge of the [[Fierani Forest]] halfway between the settlements of [[Riverspire]] and [[Erages]]. An [[Elf gate|elf gate]] can be found within the village which opens to a large number of other gates around the world. The [[Lantern Bearers]], an elven secret society that hunts down the evil [[Drow|drow]], use a site close to the gate as their main meeting place.
