> **Sardis Township** is a large town on the upper reaches of the [[River Porthmos]] in eastern [[Taldor]]'s [[Porthmos Gap]].
> The prefectural capital of the [[Porthmos Prefecture]], Sardis extends for well over a mile in every direction as it was formed as a dozen small mining communities that grew together around rich veins of [[Lead|lead]] and other minerals. The settlement sits on the chaotic, polluted landscape that stretches just a few miles inland from the South River. Technically, the piers, refineries, and warehouses are also part of the township's domain. Despite being depressing and miserable, Sardis generates a great deal of wealth, trading high-quality [[Metal|metals]] for foodstuffs to supplement their own meagre crops.
> Although not known as a trade hub, Sardis does profit from trade caravans and travelling merchants. [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur]] tribes from the [[Whistling Plains]] sometimes make the trek this far into Taldor for trade and some even choose to remain. Many are enlisted as enforcers by the local Grand Duke.
> Sardis Township is home to both the infamous [[Porthmos Prison]] and the governor of the Porthmos Prefecture, Grand Duke Thestro Briarsmith. The former is populated with the enemies of the latter.
