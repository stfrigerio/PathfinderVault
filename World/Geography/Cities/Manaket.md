> The port city of **Manaket** on [[Rahadoum|Rahadoums]] northern coast was once famous for its lush gardens, but these all dried up a hundred years ago as the desert encroached ever further into the settlement. To combat this ongoing ecological disaster, [[Wizard|wizards]] from the city's [[Arcane|arcane]] academy, the [[Occularium]], have begun planning an intricate series of shifting trenches and barrier walls to drive the sands back, even hiring [[Engineering|mechanical engineers]] from the [[Technological|technologically]] advanced [[Alkenstar|Grand Duchy of Alkenstar]], and calling on the advice of local [[Brass dragon|brass dragons]]. Significant resources have been spent to studying the feasibility of this and other projects and, today, the city is considered the focus of learning in Rahadoum.
> Some fear that the encroaching desert is a punishment by the [[Deity|gods]] for the [[Laws of Mortality|heresy of Rahadoum]], though few have the temerity to say such a thing publicly.
> The [[Pathfinder Society]] has a foothold in the city, and [[Venture-Captain]] [[Obo]] dispatches field agents from the [[Swordmeet Lodge]]. One of its more recent missions was a covert action to combat an outbreak of the [[Night Plague]] around the city in [[4710 AR]].
> Manaket is also home to a large and influential thieves' guild.
