> **Orolo's Quay** is a nearly forgotten seaside town on [[Nidal|Nidals]] [[Conqueror's Bay|Conquerors Bay]]. Before the founding of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city-states of [[Korvosa]] and [[Magnimar]], it was the last port before the long voyage through the wilderness to the cities of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. These days, the town and its [[Cheliax|Chelish]] fortress dating back to the [[Everwar]] have fallen into stark neglect, as very few [[Ship|ships]] dock here anymore. The only ships who make anchor at the crumbling wharf are those either desperate for supplies, or are smugglers bringing goods into Nidal who wish to avoid the harsh authorities in [[Nisroch]] farther south. The first floor of the fortress has been converted into a shabby inn and trading post, with an attached stable of little note. Recently, rumors have begun to circulate that smugglers pay handsomely to store contraband in the fortress' old dungeons.
