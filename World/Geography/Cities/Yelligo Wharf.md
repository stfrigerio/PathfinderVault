> **Yelligo Wharf** is a small [[Pirate|pirate]] settlement on the island of [[Dahak's Tooth|Dahaks Tooth]] in the [[Shackles]].
> The settlement was established in [[4709 AR]] and hides itself in [[Leatherwing Bay]]. The ramshackle settlement consists of a few squat buildings made of driftwood and dirt clinging to the shore. It is home to four pirate crews that prey on the merchant [[Ship|ships]] travelling close to the mainland, east of [[Shenchu Bay]]. [[Kamshika Heavyhand]] captains the armored [[Sloop|sloop]] *[[Baleful Glare]]*, [[Mean Steebyn]] captains the [[Barkentine|barkentine]] *[[Rough Customer]]*, [[Noila the Knife]] captains the [[Brig|brig]] *[[Harm's Way|Harms Way]]*, and Pendahl of Rahadoum captains the [[Sloop-of-war|sloop-of-war]] *[[Baalzebul ship|Baalzebul]]*.
> These four captains capture [[Inner Sea]] merchant vessels on their way home from [[Port Peril]], stealing their cargoes and selling their crews to the cultists of [[Dahak]] for sacrifice. [[Chadric of Laekastel]], who lives in the only stone building of the town, is the apparent head of the business.
