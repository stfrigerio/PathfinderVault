> **Talasantri** is an underwater city 250 feet below the surface of the [[Arcadian Ocean]]. Though populated by many aquatic races, it is dominated by [[Merfolk|merfolk]] and [[Aquatic elf|aquatic elves]]. The city is a sanctuary for many in a dangerous ocean, however, the residents are incredibly prejudiced against any surface-dwellers that visit who are sure to draw much attention.
