## History


### As a Chelish territory

> [[Cheliax|Chelish]] troops founded the port under the imperialistic expansion efforts of mad [[Haliad I|Prince Haliad I]] at the place of their first landing in [[Desperation Bay]]. By [[4138 AR]], Eleder was granted official status as a Chelish colony.
> The colonists named the city "Eleder" after Eleder, a young daughter of one of the first colonists, whose diplomacy and efforts to learn [[Polyglot]] enabled the colonists to live in peace with the locals.
> The site of the settlement was selected by the original founders of the city because it was a natural harbor and in addition to the shelter of the cove, a series of cascading freshwater springs welling up from rocks near the shore, provided the fresh water the settlers needed. The initial stockaded encampment gradually expanded to the walled city of Eleder.
> The upgrade of Eleder's harbor into a fully equipped shipyard was one of the initial developments. The first several decades there saw many violent misunderstandings between [[Chelaxian|Chelaxians]] and natives. Large numbers of Chelish troops were brought in to bring the natives under control and convince them to assist the colonists in bringing "order" and industry to their "savage" land.


### As Sargava's capital

> Its government remained stable, and Eleder's military was capable of policing the city. Its incredibly wealthy trading companies contributed to Eleder's political value by protecting their own investments. The [[Aspis Consortium]] held little power in Eleder due to the power of Eleder's trading companies.
> Eleder had only three-fourths as many inhabitants as [[Kalabuto]]. The overland route between the two cities broke down completely when Kalabuto's trading companies began shipping goods down the [[Korir River]]. Despite Kalabuto's growing exports trade, Eleder remained a stronghold for Sargava's political structure.
> Eleder's economy was divided between its [[Ship|shipping]] industry, and the trafficking and processing of [[Gem|gemstones]], [[Gold|gold]], [[Silver|silver]], and [[Salt|salt]] brought in from miners in the [[Bandu Hills]].
> The city showed signs of decay caused by the country's perilous financial position. This decay did not extend to the docks, however, which claimed to employ some of [[Garund|Garunds]] best shipwrights. Merchants and [[Free Captains]] alike used the facilities, and their maintenance was given top priority.
> At one time, the city boasted the [[Grallus Ball]], but all such celebrations had been canceled due to lack of funds.


### Vidric revolution

> Since the beginning of the [[Age of Lost Omens]], Sargava has faced many hardships, from isolation from Cheliax to racketeering by the [[Free Captains]] of the [[Shackles]]. In [[4715 AR]], the native [[Mwangi]] natives decided that change was needed and enacted a revolt against their colonial overlords. They were joined by some colonists who no longer felt any loyalty to Cheliax and disdained how their fellow colonists were running Sargava to the ground. The rebels soon took over the capital of Eleder (now renamed Anthusis) and overthrew Baron [[Utilinus]], named their new country Vidrian and returned it to local rule.
> One of the first acts of the new Vidric government was to stop paying protection money to the Free Captains. Unwilling to lose an easy source of income, the Free Captains invaded Vidrian. After signing a quick alliance with [[Senghor]], Vidrian managed to drive away the Free Captains and established itself as a new nation in 4717 AR.


## City geography

> The city is located between the [[Laughing Jungle]] and the Bandu Hills. It is comprised of five districts: [[Northcoast]], [[Portside Anthusis district|Portside]], [[New Haliad]], [[Lower Harbor]], and [[Outerwall]], also known as the [[Zenj]] Slums. Northcoast, Portside, and New Haliad surround [[Anthusis Harbor]] and were settled by colonials. The [[Diomar Wall]] divides these wards from the other two. Lower Harbor is located along the coast just south of the main harbor, naturally separated by the cliff face; it is populated by working-class fishermen, both colonials and [[Mwangi]]. Two-thirds of Anthusis's population live in Outerwall.
> The city has an unusual blend of architecture. The Chelish, stoic gothic stonework has adapted to Sargava's far warmer climate. The buildings are wide and low, and usually include a spacious inner courtyard.


## Society


### As Sargava's capital

> Eleder suffered from extreme racial and class division, with the colonists dominating the far larger Zenj population. Colonial law provided very few rights to the Zenj, and colonials lived in relative luxury while the native workers dwelled in poverty outside the city walls. Though born in Sargava, and despite the colony's 500 years of existence, most colonials at heart considered themselves Chelaxians and adopted [[AsmodeusChurch of Asmodeus|Chelish religion]], culture, and fashions.


## Government and politics


### As Sargava's capital

> The Grand Custodian [[Utilinus|Baron Utilinus]] maintained a personal court of eight barristers as a legal counsel. A large number of clerks handled the mundane responsibilities. The Grand Custodian held little political power in Eleder, and the responsibility of city politics fell to the upper classes.
> The aristocracy operated under a parliamentary high council, whose final decisions were determined by the most influential and powerful families of Eleder. They claimed no official titles but held most of the city's wealth. Council seats were allotted by heredity. The matriarch of the Daugustana family, [[Madrona Daugustana|Lady Madrona Daugustana]], was the city's unofficial leader. She was the oldest living colonial and upheld the ideals and customs of her ancestors.

### Trading companies

> Over the centuries, trading companies have had a profound influence upon the Anthusis's development. Among the first settlers there were many who worked for trading companies that came to the new colony to expand their business. In the southern continent, trading companies discovered vast, untapped sources of valuable goods, mainly salt, gold, lumber and [[Slaves|slaves]]. Moreover, the climate provided the ability to grow valuable crops such as sugar cane, hemp, and a variety of fruits. Also, the ample plains were good for raising [[Cattle|cattle]] and the waters of the [[Desperation Bay]] provided [[Fish|fish]] and molluscs.
> The Chelish government drafted the [[South Arcadian Charter]] to encourage expansion. Operating under the South Arcadian Charter, trading companies soon formed the backbone of a new economy. They provided Cheliax with new resources and in parallel became importers of northern goods such as steel, [[Weapon|weapons]], tools, [[Book|books]], [[World/Culture/Foods/Wheat|wheat]], and cotton. Their political influence grew as their wealth grew.
> In the wake of [[House Davian|House Davians]] fall, Baron Grallus asked trading companies for aid. He offered to protect their interests, provided that the companies joined Sargava in its secession from Chelish rule.
