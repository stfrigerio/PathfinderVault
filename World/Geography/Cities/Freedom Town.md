## History

> Freedom Town was founded by criminal organization known as the [[Sharpes Gang]] in [[4692 AR]], as they fled north to escape justice in Lastwall.  They found rich, tillable land which had been abandoned long ago to the [[Orc|orcs]] of Belkzen, and decided to set up a base there.  Over the past two decades, Freedom Town has grown into a small community of all those needing to evade the law and willing to make a hard life among the dangers of the region.  Tribute is regularly paid in food, gold, and persons to the local orc tribes and the government in [[Vigil]] has so far turned a blind eye to the problem, figuring that the hordes of Belkzen will surely alleviate them of this problem soon.
