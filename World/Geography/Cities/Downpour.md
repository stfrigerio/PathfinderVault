> **Downpour** is a small fishing town on [[Tempest Cay]] island in the [[Shackles]]. It was founded to take advantage of the plentiful [[Fish|fish]] that once made their way up and down the [[Bluehook River]] during spawning season. Since the cruel [[Catoblepas|catoblepas]] [[Gruzugr]] made its home in the river, the waters have been [[Poison|poisoned]] and the fish are gone. The residents survive by harvesting the numerous nearby clam colonies.
