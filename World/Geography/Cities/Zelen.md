> **Zelen** is a peasant settlement on the [[Rimeflow River]] in the westernmost [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province known as the [[Verge]]. It handles merchant barges heading eastward to [[Algidheart]] or [[Whitethrone]], or westward to [[Iceflow]]. Most river captains choose Zelen to sleep in a warm bed for at least one night. [[Pribuska|Baroness Pribuska]] is the ruler of Zelen. She was a paramour of [[Arvanoff Elvanna|Duke Arvanoff]], and nourishes great hatred for [[Slavena|Baroness Slavena]] of [[Skrata]] who has replaced her in the duke's affections in [[4710 AR]]. The waters of the Rimeflow near Zelen are rich with fish and the town sends a large portion of its catch as far as south as [[Redtooth]]. The [[Vasterborg Run]] is a caravan of dogsleds led by [[Raisa Gevenovna]] and [[Zavid Menavich]] that makes the challenging monthly trip to Redtooth.
