> **Morcei** was a quiet hamlet in the east of the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Lozeri]], situated under the south-eastern branches of the vast [[Shudderwood]]; the [[Mothburn]] has its source nearby. Recently the peacefulness of the hamlet was shattered when local lumberjacks felled a tree near to the settlement known as the 'Daemon Hand'. From inside the Daemon Hand flew swarms of [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bats]], or 'flying wolves' as the locals now call them. The bats made their home in the belfry of the local [[Pharasma|Pharasmin]] church house from where they terrorize the locals. The church bell tolls inexplicably each morning, summoning the bats home, and the locals fear some mighty winged lord is controlling them.
