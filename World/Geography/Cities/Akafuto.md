> **Akafuto** is [[Minkai|Minkais]] second largest port, sat at the mouth of the [[Tagiryu River]], that serves as a major part of the [[Tian Xia]] lumber trade. Akafuto exports a wide variety of raw and finished goods and the city's [[Junk|junks]] are probably the most commonly seen Minkai ship in foreign ports, particularly in [[Tianjing]]. Akafuto's most famous temple is the [[Ukuashi-Ji]], dedicated to the [[Deity|god]] of prosperity [[Kofusachi]] who is said to bless the harvested goods and crafts that flow through Akafuto's markets. Akafuto is also home to the [[Juhimeiyo School]], a monastic institution attended primarily by young nobles looking to work within the imperial court. Akafuto has maintained a remarkable political stability over the centuries, it has been ruled by a member of the [[Moniwa family]] for over a millennia.
