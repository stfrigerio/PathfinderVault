> **Jyito** is the largely ruined capital of the [[Oni|oni]] nation of [[Chu Ye]]. Located in northeastern [[Tian Xia]] on [[Sapphire Sound]], Jyito was a bustling city of almost 30,000 people before the fall of [[Lung Wa]]. Now oni, [[Giant|giants]], and [[Ogre|ogres]] roam the streets, frequently bringing in fresh [[Slave|slaves]] to replace those killed or eaten.
