> **Xin-Edasseril** was the capital of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] realm of envy, [[Edasseril]]. It is now the capital of the kingdom of Edasseril within the nation of [[New Thassilon]].



## History

> Initially located on modern-day [[Chakikoth Isle]] in the [[Ironbound Archipelago]] of northwestern [[Avistan]], Xin-Edasseril was later moved eastwards, to the site of modern [[Peridot Isle]], in [[-5402 AR]]. Few clues to Xin-Edasseril's exact location had survived to the present day; in modern times, stones from the ruins of Xin-Edasseril were used to create the town of Melesa.
> Although it shared the monumental architecture of the other Thassilonian cities, it was a low-lying city built on a [[Disease|disease]]-spawning marsh, with devastating plagues that the ancient priests of [[Desna]] could not prevent even with their [[Healing|healing]] magic. It was constantly plagued by attacks from [[Ettercap|ettercaps]], [[Ettin|ettins]], and [[Elf|elven raiders]]. Its byzantine bureaucracy was filled with ambitious and ruthless administrators who cared more about their personal advancement than managing the realm effectively.


### Runelord Belimarius

> Xin-Edasseril's final ruler, the [[Belimarius|Runelord Belimarius]], oversaw the city and the nation from Palace Miasmora, where she kept her predecessor, [[Phirandi]], entombed in a transparent coffin of force. Xin-Edasseril's other famous attraction was the [[Temple of Desna's First Dream|Temple of Desnas First Dream]], a shining edifice of glass, [[Diamond|diamond]], and [[Magic|magical]] force that seems to have disappeared or been destroyed, although some maintain that it can still be accessed through the [[Dimension of Dreams]].
> During [[Earthfall]], Runelord Belimarius' attempt to create a *[[Runewell|runewell]]* failed, trapping Xin-Edasseril in a crystal sphere, called [[Crystilan]] by the local [[Varisian|Varisians]], and suspending it outside of [[Time|time]].


## Modern Xin-Edasseril

> Heroes shattered the dome of [[Crystilan]] in [[4718 AR]], freeing the city of Xin-Edasseril and its inhabitants from their prison in time.
