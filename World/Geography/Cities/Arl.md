> **Arl** is the capital of the High Plateau Thurokdom on the [[Planet|planet]] [[Akiton]].



## Geography

> Arl is located on a rocky plateau above an ancient sea bed. At the centre of the city is a 500-foot-tall red pyramid, topped by a [[Portal|portal]].


## Government

> Arl is ruled by a princelike leader bearing the title *thurok*.


## History

> During the [[Age of Legend]], powerful [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] came to Arl from [[Golarion]] and subjugated the locals, who believed them to be [[Deity|gods]]. While few newcomers have arrived since then, the people of Arl continue to speak a descendant of the [[Languages of Golarion|Azlanti language]] and officially consider their city to be an outpost of [[Azlant]].


## People

> Arl's primarily [[Humanoid|humanoid]] population live a hard life, farming and defending themselves as necessary and watching gladiator games in the Crimson Forum. Those who arrive in Arl via the portal on top of the pyramid (such as via the [[Maze of the Open Road]] in [[Galt]]) are considered to be new incarnation of ancient gods and named thuroks, but must tread carefully lest they get torn apart by their faithful, who still remember how their ancestors were subjugated.
