> **Ganagsau** is the largest set of [[Ghol-Gan]] ruins in the [[Cannibal Isles]] of the [[Shackles]]. It is also the location of their so-called [[Deity|deity]], the [[Blood Queen]]. The Blood Queen is actually a powerful [[Outsider|outsider]] of astounding power and [[Evil|evil]] who has transformed the [[Kuru|kuru]]â€”people who were forced onto the islandsâ€”into primitive monsters. 
> The Blood Queen's current high priest is [[Bukrugsor]]. He serves in the [[Sanguine Cathedral]] as the intermediate between the kuru and their "goddess", making demands that include [[Human|human]] sacrifices and other acts of repugnant devotion.
