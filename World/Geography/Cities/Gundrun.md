> **Gundrun** is a recently reoccupied town in the area previously referred to as the [[Worldwound]], but now known as the [[Sarkoris Scar]]. The people of Gundrun are descendants of the original inhabitants of the area, back when it was known as [[Sarkoris]].



## History

> During the period of [[Demon|demonic]] occupation, Gundrun was the only settlement in the Worldwound where a semblance of normal life was found. Due to its distance from the heart of the demonic incursion, settlers and refugees returned to the city in order to eke out an existence and, some dream, perhaps retake their homeland.
> The town itself was sacked decades ago by the demonic forces, and many of the buildings are little more than crumbling ruins. The settlement served as a hub of trade (usually through barter) with local villages scattered throughout the region. The area was also home to the demonic swarm creatures known as [[Kakuen-taka]], the Hunger That Moves".


## Gundrun today

> Since the closing of the Worldwound in [[4718 AR]], Gundrun has become a rallying and staging point for those attempting to reclaim the lands of [[Old Sarkoris]] and free it from its remaining demonic inhabitants. Followers of the [[Green Faith]] have combined with the descendants of the land's original [[Human|human]] denizens to refortify the fort and stockpile it with supplies. Known as [[Reclaimers]], they focus on restoring wild lands and reclaiming the sites sacred to the Green Faith, such as the mystical city of [[Dyinglight]] and a repository of ancient [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druidic]] traditions deep in the [[Shudderwood]].


## Places of interest

> A curious monument stands in Gundrun, said to be a memorial to the [[Aasimar's Mercy|aasimar]] warriors who fell in battle with the fiends of the Worldwound. Curiously, no one can say when the monumentâ€”a stack of white marble blocksâ€”was erected, or by whom.
