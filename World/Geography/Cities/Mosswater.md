> The [[River Kingdoms]] settlement of **Mosswater** was established as a quiet fishing retreat by an exiled [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] merchant named Artoor Geera. Geera's apothecary discovered a valuable process for making luminous dyes from the unusual glowing plant life of the nearby Glow Water Lake.
> In [[4664 AR]] a tribe of [[Merrow|merrow]] moved into the area and slaughtered the inhabitants of the village. The aquatic [[Ogre|ogres]] have driven off all subsequent attempts to re-occupy the site and take advantage of the lucrative dye-making process.
