> The [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of **Corentyn** (pronounced KOHR-ehn-tin) is located on the far southwestern tip of the country, as the capital of the [[Archduchy of Longmarch]]. Founded as a military outpost, the [[Arch of Aroden]] forms the western border of the city, and a 50-foot-high limestone wall continues on around the northern and eastern landward sides. Also known as **Port Indomitable** and the **City of Nine Forts**, Corentyn has survived dozens of wars, and remains a major trade center and military outpost in the new, infernal Cheliax of [[House Thrune]].



## History

 
 The [[Arch of Aroden]].
> Established in [[1520 AR]] by the [[Army of Exploration|Taldors Third Army of Exploration]] commanded by [[Coren|General Coren]], the city of Corentyn began as a secure army fortification, and although it gradually took on other aspects, it has never lost this feel of a fortified outpost.
> Major changes came in [[2555 AR]], when the [[Oath Wars]] in the neighboring nation of [[Rahadoum]] caused thousands of religious exiles to flee their homeland. Many of these refugees fled across the straits and settled in Corentyn, creating growing spiritual unrest and a desire to strike back against the unbelievers they had left behind. Seeing a need to distract his restless citizens, Lord Kevid Chemoch initiated a large construction project, dedicating it to the [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]]. He commissioned that a cyclopean bridge be constructed to connect the city to the southern continent of [[Garund]] across the [[Hespereth Strait]], and by [[2606 AR]] the Arch of Aroden was completed. Now with an easy trade route to the south, Corentyn became a major player in the [[Slave|slave]] trade.
> Since the construction of the Arch of Aroden, the city has been Cheliax's first defense against numerous invasion attempts by Garundi nations.


### Chelish Civil War

> Corentyn was the site of the [[Battle of a Hundred Kings]], a pivotal defense by [[House Thrune]] against [[House Davian]] in [[4639 AR]] that severely weakened House Thrune's remaining military forces. [[Abrogail Thrune I|Queen Abrogail Is]] ascension occurred a year after the victory.
> [[House Charthagnion]], which ruled the Archduchy of Longmarch before the war, maintained its control under House Thrune.


## Economy

> Because of its position astride both the [[North Tack]] and the [[South Tack]] trade routes, Corentyn has become the trading partner of nearly all the nations and cities of both of [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]]. Control of the Arch of Aroden and the presence of the strong [[Chelish Navy]] allows the city to control movement through the [[Hespereth Strait]], and a heavy "Inner Sea Access Tariff" is charged to all ships moving between the [[Inner Sea]] and the [[Arcadian Ocean]]. It remains a major international hub for the slave trade, because of the security that the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Chain]] provides for transactions. A Corentyn company has even recently secured a contract to import valuable trade goods from the [[Anchor's End|Anchors End]] colony in distant [[Arcadia]].
> Much of the money which flows into Corentyn flows back out just as quickly. The nobles of the Chelish capital, [[Egorian]], control the trade in Corentyn through proxies and servants and rarely visit the city. Heavily damaged during the [[Battle of a Hundred Kings]] in [[4639 AR]], the walls still remain pocked and pitted. Since the [[Chelish Civil War|Thrune Ascendancy]] the only public work efforts have been concentrated in the naval yard.


## Government

> Toward the end of the [[Chelish Civil War]], the lord-mayor of Corentyn capitulated to House Thrune and embraced [[Diabolism|diabolism]]. The city's remaining priests of Aroden promptly cursed him as an "arch-heathen, sworn to destroy the city from within". Subsequent lord-mayors have adopted the name as a badge of honor, and made it the official title of their office.
> The current lord-mayor, [[Kettermaul Charthagnion|Archheathen Kettermaul Charthagnion]], is a former captain in the Chelish navy and a fair administrator. A traditionalist in the new infernal Cheliax, he maintains power through pacts with various devils and a close personal friendship with Lictor Uzo Adom of the [[Order of the Chain]]. He has, however, fallen out of favor with his family, as he no longer treats his dealings with [[Asmodeus]] and [[Hell]] as a religion, but instead considers it a matter of business and necessity.


## Geography

> Though widely known as the "City of [[Nine Forts]]", more than a dozen fortified areas and buildings are scattered across Corentyn. From land, view of the seaport is totally obstructed by the fifty-foot-tall outer walls made of limestone. Only from the sea can the flow and outline of the city be determined. Buildings stand close together for support and fortification. Other than the steep paved streets moving up the hillside from the port, few passageways or alleys exist.Cite error: Invalid <ref> tag; invalid names, e.g. too many

## Inhabitants

*See also: [[CategoryCorentynInhabitants]]*
> Corentyn is one of the main [[Halfling|halfling]] settlements in the [[Inner Sea region]], where they dominate the city's crime (see *[[Crime]]*) and are known for their hard work in the city's docks and shipyards. These elements have gained the race more respect in Corentyn than halflings get in other parts of Cheliax.


## Crime

> The local thieves' guild is called the [[Thin Wisps]], and are led by the halfling [[Kantha Elvignon]]. The guild pays taxes and percentages to the city just like any other trade organization, and receives only cursory punishments in return. Wisps use a chalk drawing of a ghost to identify themselves and their crimes.


## Religion

> The only large temple in Corentyn is naturally dedicated to Asmodeus, and is located in the High Quarter. Most gods, however, have at least a pocket of believers in Corentyn. Several including [[Erastil]], [[Abadar]], [[Iomedae]], [[Torag]], [[Milani]], and Aroden still have organized groups of worshippers. As Corentyn was a pilgrimage site for Arodenites over thousands of years, even his death has not changed the popular culture that grew up around his worship in Corentyn. Many of the local superstitions and sayings can be traced back to Aroden.


> [[Paizo]] published a chapter on Corentyn in *[[Cities of Golarion]]*, including a map of the city on p. 16.
