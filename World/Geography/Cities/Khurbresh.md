> **Khurbresh** is a small [[Ratfolk|ratfolk]] village in eastern [[Qadira]], located in the foothills of the [[Zho Mountains]] approximately a day's travel from the town of [[Khoka]].



## History

> The current settlement is the second to bear the name: the ratfolk formerly made their home higher in the mountains, but were forced to move when an earthquake shifted the course of the nearby river. Before new warrens could be dug, many lives were lost in a [[Chupacabra|chupacabra]] attack that came to be known locally as "the Longest Night". Vint Hasir traveled to a nearby human town for help, and brought back adventurers [[Seelah]] and [[Kyra]], who, with Hasir and two convicts released by Seelah, cleared out the monsters.
> The community now thrives under the leadership of Hasir and Adiba Shenen.


## Geography

> The Khurbreshi ratfolk began excavating the Cavernfast into a canyon wall following the Longest Night. An artificial cavern reachable through a dozen different tunnels, the Cavernfast serves as both the town treasury and a refuge in the event of attack.
> The Tall House, one of the few buildings constructed fully above ground, serves as guest accommodations for visiting humanoids. Vint Hasir's mate Saidah decorated the dining room with two murals of the human adventurers who helped save the town during the Longest Night.
> Further down the canyon, another cave called the Dirtnest serves as a stable for the ratfolks' [[Dire rat|dire rat]] steeds.
> At each end of the canyon lies two ledges dug out of the cliffside called the Watchrocks, which serve as sentry posts. A shift on the Watchrocks is anticipated by Khurbreshi children as a stepping stone to adulthood.


## Government

> Khurbresh has no formal local government, though the words of Hasir and Shenen do carry great weight. As long as they're willing to work to work for the good of the village, every person is entitled to their say.
