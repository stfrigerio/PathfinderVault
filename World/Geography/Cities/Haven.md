> **Haven** is a clouded island in the middle of [[Lake Ocota]] that contains the largest settlement of [[Kallijae]] [[Elves|elves]]. The fog that surrounds the island serves the Kallijae well, as they prefer highly defensible and hard-to-find areas to settle. Because of how hard it is for others to find, Haven serves as a place to retreat to and recuperate. The Kallijae sometimes call it Last Stand to reflect this.
