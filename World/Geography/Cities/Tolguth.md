> Like the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] largest settlement, [[Icestair]], **Tolguth** is nestled against the icy walls of the [[Crown of the World]]. Unlike Icestair it is a warm, almost tropical town, surrounded by great ferns, rhododendrons, and green [[httpenwikipediaorgcycad|cycads]]. The reason for this vast difference in temperature is the volcanic vents and thermal springs that dot the area. Within this valley roam fantastic creatures that are not found anywhere else in [[Avistan]]. These include duck-billed [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaurs]], swift raptors, mighty [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|tyrannosaurs]] and predatory terror birds like the [[Axe beak|axe beak]]. Unsurprisingly, the city is walled for the protection of its inhabitants, but these walls provide only a slight hindrance to the largest of the valley's creatures. Despite being surrounded by a dinosaur-infested wilderness, the biggest danger to the people of Tolguth comes from the [[Worldwound]] and its fell [[Demon|demonic]] influence.
