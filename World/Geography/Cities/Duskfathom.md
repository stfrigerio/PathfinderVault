> **Duskfathom** is the undercity of [[Axis]], located beneath [[Aktun]], and the divine realm of [[Norgorber]]. It consists of buildings that hang like stalactites from the ceilings of dark caverns, isolated dungeons rising from the depths, and pools of factory residue that give birth to obscene monstrosities. [[Magic/Divination]] into Duskfathom from outside is impossible, as is [[Teleportation|teleportation]] into or out of Duskfathom. [[Portal|Portals]] from Duskfathom lead to the upper layers of [[Hell]], [[Abaddon]], and the [[Abyss]], and provide a way for their denizens to raid Axis.
