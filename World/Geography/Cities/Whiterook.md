> **Whiterook**, sometimes denoted **White Rook**, is located in the east of [[Southmoor]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] hard against the border with [[Irrisen]], from which nation the people of Whiterook are defended by their own fierce fighters and a magically-enhanced vine and birch wall. The settlement lies on the banks of the [[Thundering River]].


## Trade

> Recently, [[Nadya|Baroness Nadya]] of the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] town of [[Dalun]] has attempted to start peaceful trade with Whiterook, even sending trade delegations to discuss terms. However, on numerous occasions an Irriseni warlord has raided into Southmoor across the [[Thundering River]], destroying any chance of successful negotiations.
