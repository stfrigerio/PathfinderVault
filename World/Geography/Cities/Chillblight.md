> **Chillblight** is the regional capital of [[Feyfrost]], the [[Irrisen]] province ruled by the cold fey. The city is located in northeastern Irrisen on the [[Frozen Road River|Frozen Road]], and was built by the cold fey themselves. Being creatures of the [[First World]], they eschewed traditional building materials, and carved the whole city out of ice that shimmers in the cold, northern sun.


## Connection to the First World

> The borders between [[Golarion]] and the First World are thin within the city, giving its [[Fey|fey]] inhabitants the ability to pass back and forth between the dimensions with ease. Visitors to Chillblight can witness the fey fading in and out as they walk down the street.


## Inhabitants

> The majority of Chllblight's population is fey, with most [[Human|humans]] kept as slaves. The exception to this is the small population of human merchants who operate with special licenses within the city issued by the national government in [[Whitethrone]].
