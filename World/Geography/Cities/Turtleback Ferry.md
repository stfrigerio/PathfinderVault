> The town of **Turtleback Ferry** was until recently a relatively quiet frontier hamlet located on the banks of the [[Skull River]] in central [[Varisia]]. Events related to the failed [[Giant|giant]] invasion of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] lowlands in [[4707 AR]] caused quite a bit of disturbance, but the town has since regained much of its former innocuousness.



## History

> Turtleback Ferry came under the nominal control of the city of [[Magnimar]] in about [[4662 AR]], even though it is geographically closer to [[Korvosa]]. The village had already been well established by that point, but was looking for additional protection from marauding [[Ogre|ogres]] and [[Ogrekin|ogrekin]]. The lord-mayor had nearby Fort Rannick built for this purpose, bringing in the [[Order of the Black Arrows]] to man it and lead the offensive against the threats of the region. With the help of the [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]], the ogres of [[Hook Mountain]] were decisively defeated in 4662 AR in the Valley of Broken Trees, and until recently the ogres had not been able to mount a successful offensive.


### Recent history

> Under direction of the foreign [[Stone giant|stone giant]] leader Barl Breakbones and the insidious control of the nefarious [[Lamia matriarch|lamia matriarch]] Lucrecia, Turtleback Ferry and the keep of Fort Rannick came under renewed threat in 4707 AR. Seeing the rangers of the fort as a threat to the planned giant invasion's weapon and armor production on Hook Mountain, ogres and ogrekin attacked and occupied the fort, killing the members of the order to nearly the last man. With the help of a group of heroes sent by the lord-mayor of Magnimar, the fort was retaken and the threat of Hook Mountain eliminated.
> At the same time, the ogres were able to damage the dam of [[Skull's Crossing|Skulls Crossing]] enough to nearly cause a damaging flood of Turtleback Ferry, and setting the antediluvian creature known as [[Black Magga]] loose on the town. It too was defeated by the Magnimarian heroes.
