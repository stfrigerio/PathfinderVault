> The [[Drow|drow]] city of **Giratayn**, a colony of [[Zirnakaynin]], lies in the upper levels of the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Sekamina]], located far below the surface nation of [[Druma]]. The city is a strong trade hub, especially in its dealings with [[Hagegraf]].



## Relationships


### Zirnakaynin

> The city is a colony of Zirnakaynin, the largest drow settlement and the most populous city in the Darklands. The links are so strong that the leader of Giratayn is always selected from the first daughters of the great families of Zirnakaynin; and this leadership changes regularly every 50 years.


### Hagegraf

> Giratayn's most important trading partner is the nearby [[Nar-Voth]] city of the [[Duergar|duergar]], [[Hagegraf]]. In drow circles, one of the most important marks of success for the ruling leader of Giratayn is the strength of this trading bond with the firm duergar merchants.


### Druma

> The [[Jailed Emergence]], a sinkhole in Druma that plummets through Nar-Voth and into Sekamina, is the nearest exit to the surface from Giratayn. Above ground, the Jailed Emergence is ringed with stone towers oriented toward defending the surface from subterranean interlopers, and [[Prophet of Kalistrade|Prophets of Kalistrade]] fund protective walls that also mask their far quieter [[Slavery|slave trade]] with Darklands drow.
