> **Shiman-Sekh** is the northwestern-most city of [[Osirion]], located a good 100 miles inland of the [[Inner Sea]], on the western edge of the great [[Golden Oasis Osirion|Golden Oasis]]. It sits on a trade route connecting Osirion with its western neighbor, [[Thuvia]].



## Geography

> Unlike the other great cities of [[Osirion]], Shiman-Sekh owes its water supply not to one of the country's rivers, but to the Golden Oasis, the largest freshwater spring in the deserts of northern [[Garund]]. It seems that a massive underground river runs under the Golden Oasis. The city boundaries encompass a series of shallow lakes in the shape of lotus petals stretched out over several square miles. Each lake serves as home to thousands of waterfowl and a small population of [[Crocodile|hetkoshu]]. Valuable farmlands around these lakes dwarf the urban area of Shiman-Sekh itself.
> The city streets are laid out to resemble the roots of the lotus flower, and this arrangement has not changed in the over 7,000 years of the city's existence.


## History

> The precise history of the city is unclear, but legend holds that the city was constructed by the [[Song Pharaoh]] in [[-3047 AR]] after she defeated the [[Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues]], making it one of the oldest cities of Osirion. The modern city is built upon the foundations of earlier structures, and those upon even older ones. What is known is that from the time of the establishment of Shiman-Sekh, Ancient Osirion embarked upon great leaps forward in the [[Art|arts]], in [[Technology|technology]], and culturally.


## Places of interest

*See also: [[Shiman-Sekh]]*
> Due to its incredible age, the city is a true historical marvel, but there are a few places that draw particular interest. These include several obelisks in praise of the Song Pharaoh constructed after her reign; a large [[Slave|slave]] market in the south, established during the period of [[Kelesh|Keleshite]] rule, that services the city's agricultural labour requirements and the pleasures of its foreign clientele; and [[Dawnblossom]], the largest [[Osirion|Osirian]] temple to the [[Deity|goddess]] [[Sarenrae]] outside of [[Sothis]].
> The Lotus Palace, located at the center of the city, is a retreat for [[Pharaoh|pharaohs]] and it is never vacant since, by ancient tradition, its wonders should not go to waste.
> The [[Labyrinth of Shiman-Sekh]], associated with [[An-Hepsu XI]], was discovered in [[4688 AR]] beneath the topsoil of the Golden Oasis. Soon after its discovery, it was re-sealed by order of the [[Khemet III|Ruby Prince]] and it is protected by a [[Risen Guard]] contingent.
