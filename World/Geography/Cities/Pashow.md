> **Pashow** is the smallest of [[Thuvia|Thuvias]] five allied city-states. It lies in the barren south of the country, in a location conveniently close to the [[Citadel of the Alchemist]] but lacking in natural resources. It is ruled by Emir [[Guldis]], at least for the time being.
> The city's inhabitants are known for their [[Magic|magical]] talents, and revere [[Nethys]] as their patron [[Deity|deity]]. They use magic to help compensate for the harshness of the local environment.
> As one of Thuvia's five city-states, once every five years it is the city's turn to sell six vials of the prized *[[Sun orchid elixir|sun orchid elixir]]* to foreign bidders. The city has taken to using [[Teleportation|teleportation]] magic to transport the elixir.
> In the past this has been avoided because the method is not completely reliable. In fact, the last two shipments have been lost due to apparent teleportation "accidents". This has damaged the young Emir's standing, and some would like to see him replaced as rulerâ€”perhaps by [[Ziralia]], daughter of the ambitious Prince [[Zinlo 1]] of [[Aspenthar]].
