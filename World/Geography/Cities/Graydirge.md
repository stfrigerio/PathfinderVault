> **Graydirge** is a small city in the foothills of the [[Shattered Range]] in north-central [[Geb's Rest]]. The normal custom of Geb is to re-animate its citizens as [[Undead|undead]] once they die. Graydirge is literally built out of the bones of those Gebbites who were unwilling or unable to be reanimated. Its inhabitants, no doubt, have their own reasons for living in a city-sized ossuary. Its one notable feature is the [[Empty Threshold]], a temple of [[Zon-Kuthon]].


## Society

> The undead rulers often share little care for the living residents of their city, to the point where [[Mortality|mortal]] blacksmiths began to create magical [[Ring|rings]] to protect themselves and other citizens from the collateral [[Negative energy|negative energy]] effects that would often be inflicted upon them. The Blood Lords at [[Mechitar]] attempted to punish these blacksmiths after finding out, but by then the rings had been disseminated out already.
