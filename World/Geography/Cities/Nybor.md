> **Nybor**, founded in [[4641 AR]], is perhaps the most racially accepting settlement in [[Varisia]] and ranks highly among the list in all of [[Golarion]].  Located on the southern shores of [[Ember Lake]] and bordering the [[Sanos Forest]], the peaceful farming community has a more half-breeds per capita than any other Varisian city.  Interracial marriages are not only tolerated, but promoted, making it a haven for those who find themselves in precarious situations involving illicit pregnancies and other affairs which might be judged harshly in more puritanical locations. Being so close to the Sanos Forest, Nybor is also home to a sizeable [[Gnome|gnome]] population.
