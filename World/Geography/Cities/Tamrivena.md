> The county town of **Tamrivena** is located in the western [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Canterwall]], one of the [[Palatinates]], in close proximity to the unsettling [[Shudderwood]]. The *county* of Tamrivena was one of the first to declare its independence from traditional rule after nearby [[Lozeri]] did so in [[4670 AR]], replacing its hereditary ruler with a [[Palatine Council]] in a bloodless coup and changing its name to Canterwall.


## History

> In the early decades of the 41st century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]], the county of Canterwall was known as Tamrivena, and was in a precarious situation.  Ustalav had only been freed from the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]]'s control in [[3828 AR]], and Tamrivena was still in the process of recovering from over 600 years of abject enslavement.  The [[Orc|orcs]] of the nearby [[Hold of Belkzen]] sensed the county's frailty and conducted numerous cross-border raids in that time.  They were driven back by the tactical cunning of Tamrivena's rulers and the strong bows and axes of its [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]] time after time.
> This changed with the ascension of [[Andachi|Count Andachi]].  Knowing he did not have his ancestors' genius for warfare, he pleaded with the Ustalavic court for help, but his requests were mired in endless bureaucracy.  Mile by mile, the orc forces pushed further into Tamrivena, and even the Count's pleas to [[Desna]] went unanswered.  In desperation, he turned to a darker patron; he pleaded with [[Zon-Kuthon]] for aid.
> In [[4042 AR]], the Dark Prince heard his prayers, and sent the mercenary [[Kazavon]], who quickly reorganized Tamrivena's army, brutally training them to be ruthless and efficient.  Kazavon led the army across the border and massacred the disorganized orc hordes.  By [[4043 AR]], the enemy had been driven off Tamrivena's land, retreating into the foothills of the [[Kodar Mountains]].  It was then that Kazavon revealed his true intentions: instead of returning to Ustalav, he built a stronghold at [[Scarwall|Castle Scarwall]] and began to gather forces of his own.  When Count Andachi realized Kazavon's cruelty and lust for power, he turned against the general, raising an army and marching against Castle Scarwall.  The Count was easily defeated and publicly executed.  Kazavon expanded his realm and ruled with terror and war for over a decade, until he was destroyed by an army led by the [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] hero [[Mandraivus]].


### Canterwall

> The first of the Ustalavic counties to overthrow autocratic rule was Lozeri, in [[4670 AR]], in a relatively non-violent coup. The ruler of all Ustalav at that time, [[Valislav Ordranti|Prince Valislav Ordranti]], was disinterested by this political manoeuvre and quickly recognized the new arrangement in Lozeri. Shortly thereafter, the two counties of [[Vieland]] and Tamrivena followed suit, the latter county re-established itself and changed its name to Canterwall. These three counties became known as the Palatinates. In the case of Tamrivena, the reliance of the whole of Ustalav on its food production was considered a major reason for the crown not contesting its political reformation as Canterwall.
