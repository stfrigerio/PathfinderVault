*For another meaning of "Alabastrine", please see [[Alabastrine Peaks]].*
> **Alabastrine** is a city in [[Druma]] built in [[4607 AR]] to accommodate [[Aroden|Arodenite]] refugees after the [[Deity|deitys]] death; however, the migration never happened in the numbers its investors expected, and its hasty construction ceased before it was completed. [[Kelldor|High Prophet Kelldor]] purchased the partially finished city in [[4711 AR]], and since then the Druman government has auctioned control of the city in five-year spans to the highest bidder. The most recent auction occurred in [[4716 AR]].
