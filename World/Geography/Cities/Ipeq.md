> **Ipeq** (pronounced ahy-PECK) is the third-largest city in southern [[Osirion]], located along the banks of the [[Crook River]]. According to legend, Ipeq was summoned into existence in a single day by [[An-Hepsu VII|Pharaoh An-Hepsu VII]]. Ipeq stands on the southern bank of the river and completely blocks the [[Shallows of Ipeq]], one of only three ways of crossing the Crook on foot.



## History

> The pharaoh is said to have created the city from *wishes* granted by an army of bound [[Djinni|djinn]] and [[Efreeti|efreet]] in [[-2385 AR]]. Some whisper that one day the pacts which bound the [[Genie|genies]] will expire, and the city will vanish back into nothingness.
> The city's history has been linked to the nation's defense and the projection of pharaonic power and influence toward the south. The construction of Ipeq was the first stage of the Osirian invasion and subjugation of [[Katapesh]]. Even after the wane of Pharaonic influence in the south, the city served as a bastion of Osirian power. Any army seeking to invade Osirion from the south has to cross the river either at Ipeq or at the [[Khopesh Span]] built in [[-2370 AR]].
> In [[4518 AR]] the city was besieged by [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] for 17 months, before the raiders were finally repulsed.


## Military

> Today, Ipeq houses the second-largest permanent garrison of Osirian troops, surpassed only by [[Sothis]]. In modern Osirion, invasion from Katapesh is of little concern, and the garrison and its large maritime force are mainly used to protect the trade across the border, but they are ready for rapid deployment anywhere along the length of the [[Sphinx river|Sphinx]] and its tributaries.


## Government

> The [[Garundi human ethnicity|Garundi]] governor [[Hepater Rephitan]] and his appointed People's Council oversee the entire city. In times of war, command of the city reverts to its military commander and the residents are conscripted to serve until released from duty. The current military commander of Ipeq is [[Sefir Etis]]. Etis is usually occupied with the [[Risen Guard]]'s operations in the region, and is rarely interested in the politics of Ipeq. He is increasingly dissatisfied with the governor and the People's Council, who Etis feels they put the needs of civilians above the needs of the military force stationed in town. He reminds them that the city was once completely dedicated to the military needs. [[Sol Jetet|Speaker of the Council Sol Jetet]] has been making plans to drive the city off of the military subsidies and toward trade. His plans include converting more farmland to cotton production and building a series of outposts to protect the southern caravan route from the gnoll raiders.


## Description

> Ipeq is obviously not grown over the centuries by human hands. It is rather a human city grown over a militarily driven magical initial plan, a creation of the An-Hepsu VII noble [[Genie|genies]]. It is surrounded by high walls with just two heavily fortified gates, the main gate in the southeast and the opposing gate at the Shallows. Two artificially fortified hills stand on either side of the main road that goes through the city, from the first gate to the second. Their square shape and identical height reveal their magical creation. The city is divided into nine districts: [[Palace Hill]], [[Temple Hill]], [[Bladesworthy]], [[Ibis Park]], [[Crookside]], [[Shade Market]], [[Sun Market]], [[Sapphire District]], and the Stacks.
