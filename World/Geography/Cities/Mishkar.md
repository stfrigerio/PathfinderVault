> Unusually for a [[Human|human]] community in [[Iobaria]], **Mishkar** is not built from the scavenged remains of [[Cyclops|cyclopean]] ruins. Originally established in [[809 AR]] as a guard post against threats from the [[Grenalf Plateau]], it was abandoned by Iobaria around [[4607 AR]], only to be re-established by [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisian]] and [[Taldan human ethnicity|Taldan]] settlers around [[4659 AR]]. 
> The town has since become a largely self-sufficient city-state with a large agricultural and trade base. The people of Mishkar greatly value their independence and have remained unaffiliated with Iobaria's various factions, though they have forged an occasional alliance with [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaur]] tribes against [[Goblin|goblin]] hordes from the highlands.
