> The small trading town of **Hagby** is located on [[Glacier Lake]] in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] capital province of [[Thronehold]].
> Hagby is the last stop for all trade headed to [[Whitethrone]] from the west. It is ruled with paranoid scrutiny by the cruel [[Ladina|Baroness Ladina]]. The peasants do not trust anyone knowing that even a hint of the slightest misdemeanor results in harsh punishments. A lot of peasants work their daily duties with missing fingers, eye patches and worse. Yefrem Chelnitsky is the despicable agent of the baroness. He follows her everywhere, with parchment and quill in hand to record every demand and directive his mistress utters.
> Despite the overbearing atmosphere, the [[Heralds of Summer's Return|Heralds of Summers Return]] have a lot of members in Hagby including warehouse worker [[Nakia Serebrynakova]] and blacksmith [[Yuri Patasil]].
