> The town of **Averaka** is located on the south-western coast of the island of [[Flintyreach]] in the Linnorm Kingdom of the [[Ironbound Island]] and is predominantly populated by [[Half-orc|half-orcs]]. The remote island of Flintyreach was long considered too dangerous and barren to be worth settling. A small group of half-orcs decided to settle in the island and they managed to establish the now flourishing town of Averaka. They have granted the right to accept any half-orc to settle there, making the Averaka the largest half-orc settlement in the [[Inner Sea]]. The town is a haven of the half-orc culture. Most residents are occupied in fishing and railing while the others work in a supporting industry as shipwrights, or sail-makers. There are also a few small farms around the town.
> Averaka is ruled by a council of three: [[Kalla Tusk-Breaker]], [[Bravok]], and [[Suota Iron-Tongue]]. Councilor Kalla leads the town guards, the groups that patrol the island's interior, and the raiding groups that help fund the town. Councilor Bravok is a cleric of [[Desna]] and often travels to other [[Linnorm Kingdoms]], [[Varisia]] and beyond, spreading the word of Averaka among the half-orcs to recruit more settlers. Suota Iron-Tongue is the official keeper of the town's lore, mentor of the local artists, and moderator of the yearly meeting of [[Orcmoot]].
> The greatest threat to Averaka comes from the [[Hill giant|hill giants]], [[Ettin|ettins]] and [[Troll|trolls]] who live in the mountains of the island's interior. The giants are organized in independent clans or under the sway of the hill giant war chief [[Gorgnak]]. The half-orcs of Averaka fight fiercely the giants and welcome anyone who shares their hate. The Averaka giant slayers have dedicated themselves to the eradication of their monstrous neighbors.
