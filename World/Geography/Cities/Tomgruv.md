> **Tomgruv** is located to the south of the [[Grungir Forest]] and to the north-east of [[Jol]] (the capital of [[Southmoor]]) in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. Today, it is officially ruled by Southmoor's [[Linnorm King]] [[Opir Eightfingers]], but the local leaders will take control when they feel they can.
> The town is on the road between Jol and the [[Kopparberget]] mine. It is built around the entrance to an old abandoned mine. The locals who are mainly farmers and herders use the mine as a stronghold and storage facility. A few miners work on meager copper veins in the surrounding hills.
> [[Kobold|Kobolds]] and other underground enemies dwell in the lower levels of the Tomgruv's abandoned mine but so far the residents have managed to keep the upper levels safe. [[Troll]] raiders find nothing worth outside the heavily fortified mine entrance.
