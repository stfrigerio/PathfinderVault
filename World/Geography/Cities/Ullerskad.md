> **Ullerskad** is an [[Ulfen]] city situated on the northern banks of the [[Rimeflow River]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. Ullerskad is a major settlement in the region known as the [[Thanelands]] and is a hub of trade and commerce in the region. Many of the wealthiest Ulfen's live in the city, which is known for its popularity among retired Huscarls of the [[Ulfen Guard]], returned from their (well paid) services to the emperor of [[Taldor]]. 
> Numerous hunting lodges dot the surrounding region, and hunting the local wild boars (and the troublesome wolves that prey on the farmers' flocks) is a popular pastime. 
> Ullerskad is the location of a gold-adorned temple to [[Gorum]]. The nearby stream and grove of trees is the site of sacrifice, especially during the [[Spring equinox|spring equinox]].
