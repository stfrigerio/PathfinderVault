> **Kibwe** is a large, walled trading and mining town with a diverse population of [[Mwangi]] peoples and non-[[Human|humans]], situated in the eastern [[Mwangi Jungle]] west of the [[Ndele Gap]]. Among its most prominent features are the gigantic walls surrounding the city, covered in millions of mysterious runes, as well as a series of large soapstone statues with bestial faces that stand guard along the wall. These statues are also known as "[[Pillar-Watcher|Pillar-Watchers]]" by the inhabitants of Kibwe.



## Geography

> The city is home to several camps, such as the laborers of the [[Mozimba Camp]], the refugees of [[Usaro]] straining the [[Bwamandu Camp]], or the shanties of the [[Straggleblock]]. The [[Bekyar Block]] is home to many of they city's [[Bekyar]] people, and the [[Aspis Consortium]] have a [[Aspis Consortium Kibwe|significant presence]] in the city.
> Elsewhere, the [[Walk of Shrines]] is a street densely lined with many small places of worship. A [[Gold Refinery|gold refinery]] processes [[Gold|gold]] ore mined near the city. The [[Wells|wells]] dug within its walls have fortified its water supplies against sieges. The [[Adayenki Pavilion]] serves as both a civic center and hotbed for public debate.


## History

> Kibwe began as a trading post predating even [[Holy Xatramba]] many centuries ago. Within its safe walls, caravans from eastern [[Garund]] can pass through the Ndele Gap and swap cargoes with traders from the wilds of the [[Mwangi Expanse]], removing the need for either party to venture too far into what was for them dangerously unfamiliar territory.
> The subsequent discovery of natural resources (such as [[Diamond|diamonds]], gold, and [[Salt|salt]]) in the Kibwe area gave the location a significant advantage over any potential nearby competition, and rival companies fought deadly battles over trading rights. The growing local population intervened, and established free trade laws to ensure growth and prosperity was not threatened.
> Also, massive granite walls were erected â€” their builders unknown to history â€” and bolstered by countless [[Rune|runes]] to ensure the city would not be seriously threatened by the nearby jungle. The city's stout walls and deep wells have never failed.
> The walls also feature notable soapstone sculptures and [[Idol|idols]] of animalistic [[Humanoid|humanoid]] shapes known as Pillar-Watchers, which look down over the city from tall pillars. While mostly used as navigational landmarks, stories suggest they once would come to life in defense of the city should the need ever arise.
> At one time Kibwe was the eastern regional capital for the territory controlled by the lost nation of Holy Xatramba. When Xatramba fell to [[Demon|demons]] conjured by its rival [[Rastel]], the survivors fled to Kibwe.


## Society

> The city prides itself on its civic freedoms. [[Slavery|Slave-taking]] is forbidden, and those few lucky enough to escape the horrors of Usaro often congregate here. It was once perfectly legal to transport through the city any slaves taken elsewhere, or even to sell them here to foreign buyers (hence the significant [[Bekyar]] presence in town). However, the city's ruling council recently outlawed all forms of slavery within the city, which has roiled unrest in the [[Bekyar Block]] where much of that trade took place.
> Its residents are primarily of Mwangi [[Human|human]] ethnicities, but the city also is home to a vast diversity of ancestries ranging from [[Elf|elves]] and [[Gnome|gnomes]] to [[Giant|giants]], [[Kobold|kobolds]], and [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], among others. The patchwork collections of [[Languages of Golarion|languages]] and cultures makes the city an often chaotic jumble where even the street signs might change languages every few steps.
> The civic pride that encourages citizens to treat one another fairly does not prevent them from eagerly swindling foreigners whenever the opportunity presents itself, and bargaining is considered a fine art by the locals and traders who do business there. Goods traded in Kibwe include [[Darkwood|darkwood]] from the [[Screaming Jungle]], gold from [[Lake Ocota]], special glass from [[Kho]], and [[Firearm|firearms]] stolen from [[Alkenstar]].
> The civic centre is the Adayeniki Pavilion, a sacred space decorated with petals and shielded from the bustling city by hanging hides and tapestries, where courtship dances, weddings, and fertility rites are held every full [[Moon|moon]]. The pavilion is also a space for holding ongoing public debates.
> The people often offer food or kind words to the Pillar-Watchers out of general superstition, and never mock the statues, for fear of drawing their ire.


## Government

> The city is politically neutral. The governing council is appointed from the various communities based on their respective populations. All council members are expected to put the city's welfare ahead of any vested interests they might haveâ€”and failure to do so can carry the death penalty, though this draconian penalty is often not actually used. Instead the council member is simply immediately ejected from the council.
> The Aspis Consortium recognizes the city's importance as a trading centre, and is seeking to gain influence here comparable to the power it enjoys in the western trading hub of [[Bloodcove]]. It has made considerable investments in the local infrastructure, but so far its philanthropy has not been able to overcome significant local distrust. The most prominent local operation is probably that of the [[East Mwangi Mining Company]].
> Unrest in nearby Usaro has swelled the city's camps and neighborhoods, particularly the Bwamandu Camp, and the sudden growth has strained the city's resources toward what seems like an inevitable breaking point.
