> **Iarna** is a small town on the [[Marbleflow River]] in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province of [[Wintercrux]]. The town is a popular destination for [[Jadwiga]] and rich foreign merchants because of its famous hot springs. There are three resorts catering to the aristocracy as well as expensive restaurants and two grand theaters.
> The hot springs began bubbling up some 200 years ago and are thought to have [[Magic|magical]] and [[Medicine|medicinal]] powers although nothing has been proven. Hundreds of ageing or sick Jadwiga bathe in the hot springs every year. The truth is that a trapped and insane [[Magma elemental|magma elemental]] heats Iarna's springs. The elemental was summoned by [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of the [[Heralds of Summer's Return|Heralds of Summers Return]] 200 years ago but was captured and bound by Iarna's baroness at the time. The current ruler of Iarna, [[Iracetta|Baroness Iracetta]] knows the truth but prefers not to damage the town's businesses. The ageing Iracetta is a strong advertiser of the springs' therapeutic qualities.
> The captain of Iarna's town guard, [[Jazdya Vacalav]] often fights [[Fire mephit|fire]] and [[Magma mephit|magma mephits]] who are attracted by the insane elemental.
