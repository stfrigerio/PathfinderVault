> **Sekamina** (pronounced seh-kah-MY-nah) is the middle realm of the [[Darklands]], below the shallow tunnels of [[Nar-Voth]], and more well-known than deep [[Orv]]. This region consists of vast and seemingly unending underground caverns and tunnels that span continents. Found here are massive chambers, great underground rivers, and almost unfathomable lakes. Most of the entrances to Sekamina require traveling through Nar-Voth first, but there are a few deviations to this, such as [[Mobhad Leigh]]. Sekamina starts at a depth of approximately 2,000 feet and extends to about 8,000 feet.



## Geography

> Unlike the narrow tunnels of Nar-Voth above, Sekamina is served by numerous major tunnels that run underneath both the continents of [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]]. Many are patrolled by the major races of this layer, and this is the only way in which the otherwise warring species cooperate. Sekamina extends far past the [[Inner Sea region]], and its tunnels reach at least as far east as [[Tian Xia]].


## History

> While the greatest denizens of Sekamina are now the [[Drow|drow]], at one time the [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]] were the primary race that settled the region. These former servants of [[Ydersius]] had withdrawn from the surface world due to their war with [[Azlant]] and established great underground cities. Here they hibernated for several millennia, during which time other races began to inhabit Sekamina. The drow settled here prior to [[Earthfall]], choosing to remain on [[Golarion]] rather than travel to [[Sovyrian]] to avoid the coming apocalypse. Sekamina was mostly spared from the destruction wrought by the fall of the [[Starstone]], unlike the caverns of [[Nar-Voth]] above.
> Beginning in the [[Age of Darkness]], other races began inhabiting the great spaces of Sekamina. [[Ghoul|Ghouls]] from the surface established the undead civilization of [[Nemret Noktoria]] below the sands of [[Osirion]] and [[Thuvia]], settling near large deposits of a [[Necromancy|necromantic]] ore called [[Lazurite|lazurite]], while [[Gug|gugs]] were brought to Golarion by the [[Rovagug|Rough Beast]]. The aquatic race known as the [[Skum|skum]], freed from their servitude to the [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]] by the breaking of their masters' undersea civilization, migrated to the sunken cities, underground lakes, and oceans of Sekamina. The bizarre [[Seugathi|seugathi]] slowly migrated up from the deep caverns of Orv, while the [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] established themselves in small groups throughout this level of the Darklands. Fleeing the destruction of their homeland, [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] [[Human|humans]] came here and over the millennia, slowly devolved into creatures now known as [[Morlock|morlocks]].


## Inhabitants

> Of the three levels of the Darklands, Sekamina can be considered the most densely occupied or "civilized". The inhabitants of Nar-Voth congregate in a few large tunnels or caverns, separated by hundreds of miles of "wilderness" made up of small, hard-to-navigate passageways, while the larger Vaults of Orv are small, contained ecosystems that have little to do with one other. Sekamina may have its wilderness too, but the three great civilizations of this layer, the drow, the svirfneblin, and the ghouls, each hold sway over hundreds (or thousands) of inhabited chambers, connected by large, and well-patrolled tunnels.


### Drow

> The drow of Sekamina control the largest empire in the Darklands of the [[Inner Sea region]], which stretches under much of central [[Avistan]] from [[Varisia]] in the west, all the way to [[Razmiran]]  in the east, and from under the [[Worldwound]] in the north, to under [[Cheliax]] and [[Andoran]] in the south. Its cities are places of near anarchy, barely controlled by the matriarchal [[Drow noble houses|12 great noble houses]] filled with cruelty, decadence, and violence.


### Ghouls

> A civilization of intelligent and cultured ghouls dwell in and around the city of Nemret Noktoria, found beneath the [[Barrier Wall]] mountains between [[Osirion]] and [[Thuvia]]. They are ruled by the priests of their [[Demon lord|demonic patron]] [[Kabriri]] and trade in slaves with the human nations above.


### Skum

> The aquatic skum live in and around the large underground body of salt water called [[Lake Nirthran]], which is located beneath much of the [[Inner Sea]]. Their numbers have always been small, but they tenaciously survive in small tribal groups in places like [[Ulat-Kini|Temple of Ulat-Kini]] (located between the nations of Osirion and [[Qadira]]), and the caves of [[Cold Momugado]], found beneath the Inner Sea south of central [[Cheliax]].


### Svirfneblin

> The svirfneblin or [[Svirfneblin|deep gnomes]], like their [[Gnome|surface-dwelling cousins]], are exiles from the [[First World]]. They settled in Sekamina to keep a close watch on the [[Fey|fey]] of the [[Court of Ether]] in Nar-Voth above, whom they partially blamed for the gnomes exile *(see [[GnomeHistory|Gnomish History]] for more details)*. Unlike most other Darklands races, Svirfneblin are generally friendly towards outsiders, although they are extremely protective of their settlements, making them virtually unknown to the other inhabitants of Sekamina.


### Minor races

> Although the species listed above are the ones most commonly encountered while exploring Sekamina, there are many other races who call this level of the Darklands their home.

> - **Driders**: Originally the result of [[Drow|drow]] [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]], [[Drider|driders]] have the upper bodies of dark elves, and the lower abdomen of spiders. They are generally encountered in small, female-led tribes in the more "wilderness" areas of Sekmaina.
> - **Gugs**: These fur-covered giants originally came from a dream dimension, pulled into the Darklands by the will of the imprisoned god [[Rovagug]]. They can be found in the lowest caverns of Sekamina, worshiping their patron with wild, bloody devotion.
> - **Morlocks**: Debased descendants of ancient [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] [[Human|humans]], the [[Morlock|morlocks]] are little more than feral monsters who live in large tribes throughout Sekamina.
> - **Ropers**: Generally thought of as mindless monsters, [[Roper|ropers]] are actually quite intelligent and posses an advanced culture centered around the least destructive elements of the god Rovagug's beliefs: pain and cruelty.
> - **Serpentfolk**: These ophidian creatures fled to Sekamina following a devastating war with [[Azlant]] during the [[Age of Legend]]. Most [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]] still lie dormant in a magical sleep in their ancient city of [[Sverenagati]], while others who chose to remain behind, lost their skill at magic and became more feral and savage.
> - **Seugathi**: The worm-like [[Seugathi|seugathi]] are the servants of the horrifically evil [[Neothelid|neothelids]], who dwell in the deep vaults of Orv.
