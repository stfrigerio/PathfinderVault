> **Jovvox** is a largely [[Gnome|gnomish]] town east of the city of [[Mivon]]. Originally built around a remote monastery by the enterprising gnome merchant Jov, Jovvox's weaponsmiths specialize in producing large quantities of cheap [[Weapon|weapons]], fast, thereby undercutting competition. Their raw materials come from a small nearby [[Iron|iron]] mine and from [[Halfling|halfling]] and [[Human|human]] scouts who also make Jovvox home and scavenge battlefields throughout the region for cast-offs that could be recycled.  Kellywells, the current leader of the town, is known for crafting exotic, novel weapons.
