>  Among ancient cliff-side structures (rumored to have once housed a long-extinct tribe of [[harpies]]) in caves along the shore of [[Lake Syrantula]] lies the town of **Biston**.  It was founded in [[4574 AR]] by [[Jhenni Biston]], who cleared the tunnels of their [[troglodyte]] inhabitants.  The farmers and fishermen of Biston, while citizens of [[Korvosa]], have long held a strong sense of independence and in [[4658]] Jhenni's grandson, Randas Biston, led a group of separatists in a revolt to cede the town from Korvosan control.  The government responded in full force, sending half the [[Sable Company]] and an entire regiment of [[Korvosan Guards]] to maintain order.  All the rebels were executed in Korvosa, and martial law was maintained in Biston until [[4690 AR]] when it was lifted by [[King Eodred II]].
