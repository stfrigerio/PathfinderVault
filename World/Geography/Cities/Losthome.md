> **Losthome** is an [[Ulfen]] logging town in the far east of the [[Grungir Forest]] in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. Located on the banks of the [[Thundering River]], though not actually within the Linnorm Kingdom of the [[Thanelands]], Losthome is protected by [[Kalsgard]]. Its people, many of them descendants of refugees from the [[Winter War]], constantly watch the border with [[Irrisen]] for signs of incursion, and provide sanctuary to anyone fleeing the realm of the [[Elvanna|Witch Queen]].


## Economy

> Losthome is a logging town, providing an increasing amount of timber to the Linnorm Kingdoms. It also has a strong woodworking industry producing furniture that competes with the more elaborate Irriseni products. The lumber is either milled in Losthome or sent downriver via the Thundering and [[Rimeflow River]] to Kalsgard. Barges are formed from the logs and are loaded with finished goods. Using the river for fast transportation to Kalsgard gives Losthome a good advantage over towns on the western edge of the Grungir Forest. The demand of Losthome's lumber grows, but the town has managed to keep a balance between its need for lumber and the good relations with the [[Fey|fey]] of the forest.
