> **Umnyango** (population 11,340), known as **Kalabuto** during [[Sargava|colonial]] times, is the largest settlement in [[Vidrian]]. It is a crumbling city built by [[Mwangi human ethnicity|Mwangi]] tribesmen in the pre-colonial era, and the overwhelming majority of the inhabitants are Mwangi, until recently ruled over by a minority of Sargavan colonialists. It was the main target for the anti-colonial feeling of the Mwangi city of [[Mzali]] to the east, and, in time, the internal and external Mwangi united to expel the Sargavans from the city.



## History

> Kalabuto was initially inhabited only by the [[Kalabuta]] tribe, but was discovered by [[Cheliax|Chelish]] explorers in [[4140 AR]]. It was established as a permanent colonial settlement in [[4150 AR]], but attempts to forcibly convert natives to the worship of [[Aroden]], among other slights, led to native rebellions in [[4152 AR]] and [[4217 AR]]. These revolts were put down by Chelish troops, but the conversion efforts were ended. After a string of guerrilla attacks against the Sargavan border patrol from [[4678 AR]] onwards, the city was sacked by the forces of Mzali in [[4684 AR]], [[4690 AR]], and [[4702 AR]].
> After the native peoples overthrew the colonists and established the new nation of Vidrian, Kalabuto was renamed Umnyango.


## Inhabitants

> Most of Umnyango's population is native Mwangi, with Kalabuta being the dominant tribe. During colonial times, Kalabuta were integrated into the city's military all the way to the top, with Kalabuta [[Ursel|Commander Ursel]] occupying the position of Praetor within the militia. The minority of colonials that lived in Kalabuto held most of the power and had a strong sense of racial superiority; the former governor, [[Alban person|General Alban]], was openly racist.
> The numerous invasions from Mzali have led to the growth of belief in [[Walkena]], as survivors returned with tales of a [[Mummy|mummy]] rising to thwart them. Walkena's followers believe that these events in Mzali were a precursor to Vidrian's own revolution. Although Walkena's cult remains small, kept in check by Vidric freedom fighters and those who fled Mzali out of fear of his retribution, those few believers are fanatical and seek to spread their faith by any means necessary.


## Geography

> The city is surrounded by pineapple fields and date palm orchards. It is located atop a low hill overlooking the [[River of Lost Tears]]. The city appears overgrown by the jungle. A lot of shanties and warehouses are along the riverbank.


## Sites of Interest

> There was a [[Pathfinder lodge]] in the city, but it was recently closed, during the colonial period, in the face of native unrest. However, the new Vidric government is allowing the [[Pathfinder Society]] to re-establish this lodge, albeit reluctantly, since the people fear that these outsiders will try to exploit the [[Mwangi Expanse]] again; nevertheless, some see the value of foolhardy [[Adventurer|adventurers]] in combatting the dangers lurking in the jungle.

> - [[Fort Kalabuto]]: Fort Kalabuto is a military stronghold built in a ruined temple; it was General Alban's home and headquarters. It is regarded as the most defensible position in the entire city.
> - [[Ruins Kalabuto|The Ruins]]: A number of ruined buildings in Kalabuto are only the tip of much larger underground complexes, generally referred to as the Ruins. Strange creatures, such as talking [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Monkey|monkeys]] and skeletal [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], are rumored to dwell in the ruins. It is within one of the ruins of a temple that a [[Varisian]] [[Monk|monk]] named Altori teaches his discipline to a number of students.
> - The [[First Colonial Bank of Sargava]]: the bank's fate under Vidric rule is unknown.
