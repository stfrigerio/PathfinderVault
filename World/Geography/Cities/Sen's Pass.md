> **Sen's Pass** is a small village located in the [[Vale of Red Breath]] in the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Amaans]].  It was terrorized for many years by the [[Undead|undead]] ruler of Amaans, the [[Galdyce|Viscount Galdyce]], until he was killed by adventurers in [[4685 AR]].  Villagers have once again begun to worry, however, as lights have been spotted in the nearby ruins of [[Castle Galdyce]] at night.
