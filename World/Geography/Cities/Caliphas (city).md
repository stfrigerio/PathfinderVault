> A city made rich by trade from across [[Lake Encarthan]], **Caliphas** has long been described as the very soul of [[Ustalav]]. Caliphas is Ustalav's largest city and has a tremendous impact on the surrounding lands, supporting most of the wineries and perfumeries that dot the [[Caliphas|County of Caliphas]].



## Economy

> Resting on the shores of Lake Encarthan allows Caliphas to take full advantage of that massive trade route, and Caliphas is consequently a richâ€”some might even say decadentâ€”city. The city is also very cosmopolitan, a relative rarity in suspicious Ustalav; many travellers visit from foreign parts, and some never leave, their disappearance rarely noticed by the population.


## Government

> Since the relocation of Ustalav's capital from ancient [[Ardis]] to Caliphas, the city has been home to the Royal Court of [[Aduard Ordranti III|Prince Aduard Ordranti III]], a nest of power hungry merchants, treacherous nobles, and corrupt courtiers. An ancient rivalry has existed, seemingly since the earliest days of Ustalav's refounding, between the Royal House of Ordranti, and the rulers of Caliphas, [[House Caliphvaso]]. With the nation's capital moving some three decades ago, the two houses have now become close neighbours, only intensifying each side's subtle scheming to undermine and, perhaps, ultimately, destroy the other.


## Geography

> Nestled behind protective breakwaters that spare the city from the worst of Lake Encarthan's storms, the entrance to Caliphas is guarded by the [[Reaping Rock]]. Caliphas is frequently shrouded in lake mist, its fog lanterns barely cutting into the gloom that all too often engulfs the city. Caliphas is considered by many to embody the soul of Ustalav, which perhaps prompted the [[Valislav Ordranti|Eunuch Prince]] to move the nation's capital there from Ardis. To the east of the city, the [[Laurelight Hill]] (also the name of the district which sits atop it) overlooks Caliphas and serves as home to some of its wealthiest inhabitants.


## History

> Caliphas was refounded as the city it is today in the wake of the [[Shining Crusade]] (and its victory over the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]]) by [[Sesasgia Caliphvaso|Countess Sesasgia Caliphvaso]], a distant ancestor of the city's current ruler [[Carmilla Caliphvaso|Countess Carmilla Caliphvaso]].
