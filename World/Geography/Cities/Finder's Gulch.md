> **Finder's Gulch** is a ruined and abandoned village in the [[Menador Mountains]] of western [[Isger]] that is home to a powerful priestess of [[Urgathoa]] named [[Illcayna Alonnor]]. She was transformed by her [[Deity|goddess]] into a monstrosity known as a [[Daughter of Urgathoa|daughter of Urgathoa]] and raids the countryside around Finder's Gulchâ€”including neighboring [[Cheliax]] and [[Molthune]]â€”for victims to expand her growing army of [[Wight|wights]].


## History

> Over a century ago, the village of Finder's Gulch was attacked by Alonnor and her wights. She killed all of its inhabitants and transformed the settlement into a lair for herself and her minions.


## Inhabitants

> Beyond the countless wights and their mistress, the ghost town is also said to be inhabited by the bloodthirsty [[Fey|fey]] known as [[Redcap|redcaps]], although how the two populations can possibly coexist is unknown.
