> A great stone bridge spanning the [[Noyrus River]] in [[Iobaria]], **Kridorthrost** dates back to the [[Cyclops|cyclopean]] nation of [[Koloran]]. In [[1080 AR]], Iobaria's Year of Plenty, [[Human|humans]] settled in the area of the bridge, building their wooden houses upon its stone arch and on the eastern bank of the river, away from the cyclopean ruin on the western bank. Kridorthrost is controlled by the noble houses of [[Kridorn]], and while the town does not officially limit trade with Kridon's rival, [[Mirnbay]], merchants and travellers associated with the town suffer more accidents than would normally be expected.
