> **New Stetven** stands on the southern bank of [[Needle Lake|Needle LakeLake Reykal]] in central [[Brevoy]] and serves as the nation's capital. The city has been the seat of power in Brevoy since the warlord [[Choral the Conqueror]] founded it in [[4499 AR]] after uniting the separate nations of [[Issia]] and [[Rostland]] under his rule.
> Today, New Stetven is a bustling trade city, acting as a hub for exporting [[Brevoy]]'s rich supply of grain, fish, timber, and ore to the rest of the northern kingdoms such as [[Mendev]] or [[Numeria]], and down the [[East Sellen River]] to the [[River Kingdoms]]. The food from [[Rostland]] sustains many of the northern realms, where constant bandit raids or invading demonic armies make farming difficult. In exchange for these much-needed goods, imports of exotic items from all corners of [[Avistan]] (and beyond) such as rare Numerian [[Skymetal|skymetals]] and ancient [[Osiriani]] relics are common in New Stetven's rough-and-tumble marketplaces.
> New Stetven, a city that has made prodigious use of wood in constructing everything from mansions, to streets, to forts, is known as "The City of Wooden Palaces." Due to the prodigious number of wooden structures within its walls, the city boasts several volunteer fire brigades that protect its buildingsâ€”citizens mostly join these brigades out of a sense of civic pride. There are but two notable stone structures in New Stetvenâ€”the [[Ruby Fortress]], where the [[Dragonscale Throne]] sits; and the [[Bulwark of Gorum]], a temple to the [[Gorum|Lord of Iron]].
> Snow and slush cause the streets to turn to mud for most of the year.
