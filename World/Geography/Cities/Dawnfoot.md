> The small town of **Dawnfoot** lies just southeast of the city of [[Absalom]], between the city walls surrounding the [[Precipice Quarter]] and [[Starwatch Keep]]. It began as a camp for members of the [[Starwatch]] (who must live outside the city walls due to an ancient agreement with the [[First Guard]]), but has since grown into a somewhat insular community of military families, many of whom can look back on ten generations who have served in the Starwatch. Those families who do not have members in the Starwatch generally work in some other support capacity in Starwatch Keep. Its city hall is housed in a converted siege engine.
