> **Fort Ramgate** is a frontier town of the nation of [[Molthune]], in the [[Marideth River valley]]. It has impressive fortifications, which are tested on an almost daily basis by the forces of neighboring [[Nirmathas]]. In fact, the town takes its name from the repeated attempts to destroy its gates. Despite this, the town's population continues to grow, as Molthune's [[Imperial Army]] concentrates its forces here in preparation for the almost inevitable invasion of Nirmathas. Indeed, most of the few elite troops of the Imperial Army are currently stationed in Fort Ramgate.
> The town is commanded by [[Hakar|General Hakar]]. General Lord Resper Cyrno ostensibly rules the Border region of Molthune from Fort Ramgate as its territorial seat, but spends very little time there.
