> **Iadenveigh** is a reclusive and isolated town of woodsmen and hunters in southern [[Numeria]] on the upper reaches of the [[Dagger River]]. Located on the northern outskirts of the [[Echo Wood]], the citizens of Iadenveigh reject any association with the [[Technic League]] that controls the Numerian capital of [[Starfall]].



## Culture

> Although they believe in the use of [[Magic|magic]], anyone possessing [[Technology|technology]] is accused of collaboration with the Technic League and quickly subjected to a mock trial and primitive, yet effective, execution. This technophobia dates back to an incident where [[Robot|robots]] brought by traders rampaged through the town's street.
> The town is particularly devout in the worship of [[Erastil]], crowning its walls with shed [[Elk|elk]] antlers in homage.


## Geography

> The Elkhorn Wall surrounds Iadenveigh with a reinforced earthen barrier 10 to 15 feet tall. Most of the town is divided into four quarters, all surrounding the mound known as the Brow:

> - the orchard-filled Hardblossoms neighborhood in the northwest
> - the fertile northeastern Sward
> - dense woods in the southeastern Tangles
> - the residential Bell Quarter in the southwest
> Longbitter Lake runs along the eastern side of the town.

## Government

> Iadenveigh is governed by the Deadeye Council, an 18-member body of the town's residents.


## History

> Iadenveigh is a young town, founded in [[4649 AR]] by [[Molthuni]] exiles from [[Canorate]]. However, settlement in the area dates back centuries prior, to a large Kellid tribe that built an earthen wall to defend itself from the area's strangely mutated creatures. Kellids living south of Starcaller Rock experienced mutations of their own, and after a series of ill omens, the entire clan apparently vanished.
> The Molthuni exiles who resettled the area named their settlement after their patron from [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], its location inspired by the sight of a red elk that they considered a sign from [[Erastil]]. The settlers found that most of the creatures suffered from some form of mutation except for herds of elk, which the residents also interpreted as a blessing of Erastil.
> Again, settlers to the south of Iadenveigh experienced strange mutations after a generation of drinking the water on the Brow's south side and distanced themselves from it, calling the area "Badwater".


## Prominent residents

> - [[Iadrin Ashworth|Iadrin Redfang Ashworth]], a hunter and member of the Deadeye Council
> - Brother Gahuar Derviec, [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Erastil]] and the town's high priest
> - Ivik Gunnett, selected as the town's administrative ealdorman by the Deadeye Council
> - Theska Longeye, town surveyor and member of the Deadeye Council
