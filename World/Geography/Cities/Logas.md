> **Logas** is the second city of the nation of [[Isger]]. It was once the capital until that honor passed to [[Elidir]], and its nobility dream of restoring Logas to its rightful status as the country's first city.


## Geography

> Logas is located near the border with [[Cheliax]] and is also close to the [[Goblin|goblin-infested]] [[Chitterwood]]. The city's walls are decorated with goblin corpses, and the city's war engines regularly launch large rocks into the forest to keep the goblins properly cowed and avoid a repeat of the disastrous [[Goblinblood Wars]].


## Economy

> Logas is home to the [[Molthune Armsrunners]], a criminal organization that smuggles [[Infernal|infernal]] goods from bordering Cheliax into [[Molthune]], [[Andoran]], and [[Galt]].
