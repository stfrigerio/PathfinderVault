> The port city of **Niswan** is the capital of the [[Jalmeray|Impossible Kingdom of Jalmeray]]. Niswan is a many-tiered city of pagodas renowned for its beauty. Every building supports colourful [[Silk|silk]] banners that flutter in the cold ocean winds, and red stone streets crisscross the hillsides. Cosmopolitan Niswan is a meeting place for travellers and scholars from all over [[Golarion]], and offers sights seen nowhere else in the region. Here, [[Gold|gold-draped]] eunuchs walk the streets, and [[Vudra|Vudran]] princes offering strange tribute to statues of [[Deity|gods]] utterly unknown in this region. Niswan is renowned as a centre of religious learning: its High-Holy district is home to scholars and gurus renowned as some of the wisest people on the face of Golarion, and the city is dotted with numerous shrines, statues, and temples dedicated to the hundreds of [[Deities|deities]] of the [[Vudran pantheon]].


## Districts and wards

Thakur's Palace
The luxurious palace of the [[Kharswan|thakur]] stands upon the highest point in the city. It is an architectural masterpiece; features include numerous [[Elemental|elemental]] servants, and jade fountains that flow with fine [[Alcohol|wine]].
The Heights
The highest caste families and most important members of the [[Maurya-Rahm]] live in mansions on the slopes below the palace. There are numerous [[Warrior|warriors]] living hereâ€”both the Thakur's elite guards, and the personal guards of the wealthy.
Cliff fishers' dwellings
The steep cliffs below the Heights are home to the city's low-caste fisher-folk. They ply their trade in the [[Obari Ocean]] by day, and drag their [[Ship|boats]] up the steep slope each night.
High-Holy District
The High-Holy District houses numerous [[Gold|gold]]-inlaid and domed temples and shrines. The largest is the Rahthanam Shrineâ€”a collection of countless small prayer chambers, each dedicated to a different one of the hundreds of [[Vudran pantheon|Vudran deities]].
Grand Chronicler's Circle
This area houses Niswan's largest library, home to numerous religious texts. The nearby streets are full of scribes, bookshops, and similar establishments selling and creating books, scrolls, and parchments in dozens of languages.
Maurya-Rahm Ward
This is where the [[Maurya-Rahm]] work. The most important members live in the Heights, but the others live here as well.
[[Houses of Perfection]]
The four Houses of Perfection, and their associated testing grounds, are on the road out of the city.
Commerce District
The Commerce District is the heart of the city's trade, and also includes lodgings and entertainment for visiting merchants. In [[4718 AR]], the [[Pathfinder Society]] established their new [[Pathfinder lodge]], the Niswan Lodge, in this district.
Harbor District
The city's bustling harbour sees cargoes from many nations, including much of [[Katapesh|Katapeshs]] [[Spice|spice]] trade and goods from distant [[Vudra]] and [[Tian Xia]], en route to the other ports of the [[Inner Sea]]. The district is also home to a large part of the city's population, mostly craftsmen and artisans. It and the Commerce District are the best places for visitors to find lodgings.
Terraces
The terraced fields behind the Commerce and Harbor Districts are an important source of fresh produce for the city's population, who are mostly vegetarians.
Surakpor
The southern arm of the harbour is the city's warehouse district.
Low-Caste District
The city's Low-Caste District is on the periphery, south of the Surakpor. It is a crowded maze of crooked streets.

## Features

> The city has four springs, which feed canals which flow through the city. As a result, water is plentiful. The spring in the High-Holy District is considered to be sacred, and most citizens bathe in it at least once a year.
> There are two massive statues of seated figures, known as the Statues of Concordance. One depicts the legendary [[Khiben-Sald|Maharajah Khiben-Sald]], and the other represents the [[Nex person|Archmage Nex]].
