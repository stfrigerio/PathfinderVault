> **Chimera Cove** is a small, nominally [[Andoran|Andoren]] fishing village located on [[Aspo Bay]] on the northern shores of the [[Inner Sea]]. The coast here is rough, battered by waves and wind, and usually cloaked in fog. The village sprang up during the difficult years following [[Andoran]]'s split with [[Cheliax]] and is named Chimera Cove because of the three large islands just offshore: the Lion, the Dragon, and the Goat. Due to its precarious location, the town has failed to expand and thrive, although its residents have no trouble feeding themselves via subsistence farming and fishing.
