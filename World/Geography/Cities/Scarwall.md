 The fortress of Scarwall.

> The immense gothic fortress of **Scarwall** is located in the far-eastern reaches of the [[Kodar Mountains]] within the [[Hold of Belkzen]].


## History

> Built by the warlord [[Kazavon]] (who was later revealed to be a [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] servant of [[Zon-Kuthon]]) in [[4043 AR]], the site was selected primarily due to the presence of an ancient [[Star Tower]] and its divine connection to the Midnight Lord. The fortress was constructed around the tower.
> Kazavon used the citadel first as a staging point to 'tame' the [[Orc|orc]] lands, then as a beacon to attract the orcs, and any others, to his banner. He thus reigned over his dominion for approximately 20 years, defeating all armies that were sent against him. Kazavon was eventually slain in [[4063 AR]] by a small band led by the hero [[Mandraivus]], who uncovered his draconic secret. Mandraivus stayed behind with several retainers to guard the castle. Sadly, an overwhelming orc force laid siege to Scarwall, putting the inhabitants to the [[Sword|sword]], and setting off a terrible [[Curse|curse]] within the fortress. [[Undead]] horrors and vengeful spirits slaughtered the orcs in turn, and the castle remained uninhabited by living creatures for centuries.


### Recent developments

> Scarwall was eventually sacked in [[4708 AR]] by [[Adventurer|adventurers]] who were searching for the fabled sword *[[PathfinderWiki/Items/Artifacts/Minor Artifacts/Serithtial]]*. With the undead horrors quieted, several neighbouring orc tribes began warring with one another for possession of the ruin.
