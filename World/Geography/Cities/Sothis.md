> The [[Osirion|Osirian]] capital city of **Sothis** is located just south of the [[River Sphinx]] [[Sphinx Delta|delta]], and is the largest, and most prosperous city in the kingdom of Osirion. The city is built around the molted husk of [[Ulunat]], a colossal [[Beetle|beetle]] that was one of the [[Spawn of Rovagug|spawn of Rovagug]] and slain by [[Ancient Osirion|Ancient Osirions]] first [[Pharaoh|pharaoh]], [[Azghaad]]. Except for a short time under the [[Four Pharaohs of Ascension]], it was also the Osirian capital city before the millennia of [[Kelesh|Keleshite]] rule.



## Etymology

> Sothis was named by Azghaad after the [[Ancient Osiriani]] word for [[Cynosure]], the north star. The adjective used to describe something from Sothis is **Sothan**.


## Government

> As the capital city, Sothis has become accustomed to the [[Council of Sun and Sky]] dabbling in the politics of the city in addition to its charge as representing the whole country. This interest has grown under the current First Speaker, [[Dahnakrist Phi]]. Each city district has its own council, which generally sends one or more members to sit on the Council of Sun and Sky. The members of these district councils are highly influential in their area. These councils will defer to the [[Risen Guard]] or Pharaoh's agents whenever their interest is drawn.
> The city guard, known as the [[Eyes of Sothis]], maintain order in the city. The [[First Captain of the Risen Guard]] serves as Commander of the Eyes of Sothis. Traditionally the holder of this role drops her name in favor of a title reflecting her favorite weapon. The current Commander is the [[Khopeshman of Sothis]].


## Geography

> Sothis is built a dozen miles from the River Sphinx in the eastern deserts of Osirion, and was largely dependent on oases for water until the construction of the [[Crimson Canal]], which allows the shipping directly into central Sothis and the devotion of the River Sphinx to agriculture.
> Sothis began as a series of tribal settlements around the husk of Ulunat (which became the [[Black Dome]]) due to the natural springs and the shell's shelter from the *[[Khamsin|khamsin]]* winds. Since multiple locks branch away from the main canal and traffic is observed and regulated from the canal's only island, the [[Eye of Sothis]], there is less congestion than is common in other major ports.
> Sothis's skyline is dominated by the massive Black Dome, which houses the [[Palace of the Forthbringer]] and the [[Council of the Sun and Sky]]. [[Malhitu Bazaar]] takes up much of the southeastern sector. The [[Necropolis of the Faithful]] is situated on the western bank of the Crimson Canal, expanding out from the original grounds of [[High Temple of Pharasma Sothis|Pharasmas temple]]. There is a [[Sandswept Hall|Pathfinder lodge]] in the city.


### Districts

> Sothans refer to the 'lower' and the 'upper' parts of their city related to the flow of the Crimson Canal and the River Sphinx towards the [[Inner Sea]]: the lower portion is to the north, while the upper is to the south.
> Sothis is divided into sixteen major districts with many of these incorporating many more smaller neighbourhoods. Each district preserves a distinctive culture refined over thousands of years. In addition to the sixteen districts, Sothis also includes the island within the Crimson Canal called the Eye of Sothis. There follows a brief overview of the sixteen districts:

## Organizations

## Inhabitants



### Halflings

> Sothis is one of the main [[Halfling|halfling]] settlements in the [[Inner Sea region]], and they perform important duties in all parts of Osirian society, be they [[Slave|slaves]], labourers, or artisans. This arrangement has changed little since the days of the ancient pharaohs. Osirians believe halflings emanate luck and are pleased to include them in their businesses.


## Religion

> The most prominent temples of Sothis are the [[High Temple of Pharasma Sothis|High Temple of Pharasma]] at the [[Necropolis of the Faithful]], the grand temple of [[Nethys]] and [[Azghaad's Spire|Azghaads Spire]] opposite Pharasma's temple, and the [[Temple of the Eternal Sun]]. The center of the cult of [[Norgorber]] in Osirion is a hidden, grand temple on the southern end of the [[Eye of Sothis]], and the faith maintains a small temple at the southern end of the [[Malhitu Bazaar]] as well. Temples to [[Nethys]] have been built and destroyed, often by the nation's rulers, several times throughout the ages.
