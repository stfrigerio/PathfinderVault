> The [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[Sky Citadel]] of **Dongun Hold**, located in the [[Mana Wastes]] of southeastern [[Garund]], is part of the [[Magic|magic-bereft]] [[Alkenstar|Grand Duchy of Alkenstar]]. While the nation as a whole has a primarily [[Human|human]] population, Dongun Hold is almost exclusively inhabited by dwarves.
> The ancient forge within Dongun Hold is surrounded by gargantuan dwarven statues, seemingly gazing at the forge within. A flaming upside-down hammer is engraved into the handle of each item forged in Dongun Hold to indicate its origin.



## History

> Dongun Hold was the second Sky Citadel established by the dwarves (after [[Urgir|Koldukar]]) following the completion of the [[Quest for Sky]]. Connected to Koldukar via a tunnel in the upper reaches of [[Nar-Voth]], Dongun Hold was built as part of an alliance with [[Osirion]], and envisioned as the first far-flung outpost of [[Tar Taargadth]]. Arnhild Arunak, one of the most trusted generals of [[Taargick|High King Taargick]], was assigned to command it.
> Before the Mana Wastes came into existence, the area around Dongun Hold was renowned for its natural beauty. The [[Pharaoh|pharaohs]] of Osirion let the dwarves rule their land in peace, as did the petty warlords who succeeded them after Osirion's decline, but this changed with the emergence of the two powerful [[Wizard|wizards]], [[Nex (person)|Nex]] and [[Geb (person)|Geb]].
> During the ongoing war between [[Nex]] and [[Geb's Rest]], control of Dongun Hold changed between both nations. Eventually, the dwarven inhabitants used strange [[Explosive|explosives]] and [[Divine magic|divine magic]] to seal off their fortress and prevent it from being taken again, but also laid waste to the region surrounding it. This might have resulted in the first area of dead magic in the area, as the powerful dwarven [[Magic|magic]] interacted strangely with the [[Arcane|arcane]] powers employed by both Nex and Geb. The dwarves took residence in a deep, magic-dead [[Darklands]] vault, where they eventually perfected the invention of [[Firearm|firearms]]. Later, the ruins of the collapsed dwarven structures became a settlement for [[Human|human]] scavengers and renegades from both nations.
> In [[4588 AR]], [[Ancil Alkenstar]] discovered the dwarves and made a bargain with them to provide the refugees with firearms, allowing them to defend themselves from the battles between Geb and Nex. Dongun Hold was thus opened to the outside world.


## Government

> Dongun Hold is currently ruled by High King Anong Arunak, who has led it to unprecedented prosperity. However, her rule is not without enemies: the Keepers of the Skyflame oppose the development of [[Firearm|firearms]] and the very idea of trading with Alkenstar and Nex;, while the Goldhand Lodge often tries to circumvent the king's restrictions in the name of profit, resulting in the arrest of several of their agents for smuggling.


## Religion

> Many of the dwarves of Dongun Hold venerates [[Angradd]] and believe that the Forge-Fire encourages them create increasingly potent firearms to show their piety and strength.


## Economy

> For almost 1,000 years, the dwarves of Dongun Hold have mined the rich mineral deposits of the [[Shattered Range]], providing magnetite, [[Gold|gold]], and other ores for trade and use in [[Alkenstar City|Alkenstar Citys]] many factories. However, the vast rivers of quartz and other crystals comprise most of the dwarves' wealth, since they export much of it east to [[Vudra]] thanks to lucrative trade agreements with [[Nex]]. This makes Dongun Hold the region's hub of commerce, as well as a gathering point for explorers on the forefront of [[Technology|technological]] development.
> The Hold is connected to the main city and [[Cloudreaver Keep]] via the impressive [[Bridge of the Gods]].
