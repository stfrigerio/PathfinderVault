> **Jalunth** is a village of [[Ekujae]] in the central [[Mwangi Jungle]] region of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] approximately 100 miles southeast of [[Nantambu]]. Due to years of difficult experience with outsiders, the residents rarely share even the name of their village with non-Ekujae. Finding Jalunth in the dense jungle terrain is difficult without appropriate local guides or skilled trackers.



## Government

> The locals avoid hierarchical social structures but greatly respect their elders and storytellers.
> Notable residents include:

> - Elder Kalwe, a soft-spoken and venerable woman and the village's oldest resident.
> - Elder Nolanu, a [[Druid|druid]], builder, and shaper of [[Plant|plants]], who adopts an [[Bird|avian]] form to search the surrounding jungle for dangers.
> - [[Fola Barun]], Jalunth's only [[Ekujae half-elf|wildborn]] resident. A shaman and speaker for the Ekujae.
