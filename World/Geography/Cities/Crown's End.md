> Not long after the first landing of [[Cheliax|Chelish]] settlers at [[Anthusis|Eleder]], one group split from the main party to establish their own settlement on a bluff further north, along [[Desperation Bay]].
> The settlers befriended the local [[Ijo]] tribe and fought off attacks from hostile jungle life, and their new port became known as **Crown's End**. The port soon attracted smugglers, [[Slaver|slavers]], and [[Pirate|pirates]], driving out more honest trading. Many of its current inhabitants have criminal pasts, but the town pays its taxes to the government of [[Sargava]] on time and tries to keep a low profile.
> It is ruled by [[Ilina Ysande]], who takes a dim view of those who draw outside attention to the town.
