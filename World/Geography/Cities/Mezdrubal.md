> **Mezdrubal** is a small town at the southwestern region of [[Devil's Arches|Devils Arches]] island in the [[Shackles]]. It is ruled by a petty [[Pirate|buccaneer]] called [[Longbeard]] who resents his tribute that [[Hell Harbor]] demands at the beginning of each month.
> Longbeard could not even think to refuse to pay his tribute, and he usually takes out his frustration at the poor victims of his cruel and often arbitrary judgement. Mezdrubal's ruler is also known for his love of fine clothing and jewelry, and many pirate vessels head to his town to sell such wares to Longbeard.
