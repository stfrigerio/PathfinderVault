> The small settlement of **Geb's Rest** lies on the northern border of the nation of [[Geb's Rest]], on the edge of the [[Spellscar Desert]]. It is little more than a ruin, but this dusty hamlet serves as a supply post on the road which connects the city of [[Graydirge]] to the south, through the [[Mana Wastes]] and all the way to the city of [[Ecanus]] in [[Nex]].
