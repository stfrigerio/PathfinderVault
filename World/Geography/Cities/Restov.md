> **Restov** is one of the two largest cities in the fertile region of [[Rostland]] in southern [[Brevoy]]. It is known as the Free City of Restov, but it is allied with Brevoy.



## Geography

> Restov is a trade and cultural center that borders the [[River Kingdoms]], the [[Shrike River]], and the [[Stolen Lands]].


## Dueling schools

> As the birthplace of the Aldori dueling style, the city boasts several Aldori and Taldan dueling schools, which has led to the city being a favored place for young nobles to practice dueling championships. Most prominent among them is the [[Aldori Academy]], widely regarded as the region's finest war college. A large number of Aldori duelists came to the city from [[Rostland]] after [[Choral the Conqueror]] united Brevoy.
> While the swordlords are the most prestigious and well-known of these schools, others teach complementary or adversarial styles, and their studentsâ€”disparagingly referred to as "bravos" of "lesser schools" by traditionalistsâ€”often duel prospective swordlords and each other on the streets of Restov.


## Inhabitants

> Restov is filled with people who are often refined, including a gentry that believes they are quite sophisticated, or rough around the edges. [[Taldan|Taldans]] smile at those that believe themselves cultured, as they see the natives as being quaint barbarians. As Restov is relatively wealthy, there are many lords and merchants whose sons take up dueling. Fights are common; rhetoric of rebellion against the [[Noleski Surtova|king]] can be heard throughout the city.
> The main church in the city is dedicated to [[Erastil]] watched over by High Priest Ezvanki Keegh.
> The city is home to an [[Aldori swordlord]] called [[Jamandi Aldori]].
> Many firebrands who oppose [[Noleski Surtova|King Noleski Surtova]] also hide amongst the taphouses of Restov, raising dissent. More recently, the citizens of Restov have become troubled about the politics and tensions between Rostland and [[Issia]] to the north.


## Government

> Lord Mayor [[Ioseph Sellemius]] leads the city. Sellemius is not from any of the noble families, which allows the inhabitants to keep the memories of the Aldori swordlords and times before Choral the Conqueror alive.
> A council of Swordlords aid the mayor in ruling Restov. Mayor Sellemius is a member of this council and acts as its representative.
