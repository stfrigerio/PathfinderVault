> **Bellis** is a remote settlement in far northeastern [[Andoran]] along the banks of the [[Sellen River]]. Established as a lumber town, it now produces additional agricultural goods in addition to cut timber. Bellisians like to call themselves "foresters" instead of "lumberjacks". The "lumberjacks" are regarded as undisciplined amateurs.



## Geography

> The town of Bellis sits on the western banks on the Sellen River, on the border with [[Taldor]]. It is built hard against the [[Verduran Forest]].


## History

> Bellis was founded in the mid-47th century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]], when Andoran decided to seek out additional sources of timber and increase its presence in the area.


## Economy

> The primary reason for Bellis' founding was to supplement decreased timber resources found in Andoran's [[Arthfell Forest]] and [[Darkmoon Wood]]. The town has proven to be agriculturally rich as well; Bellis is known to produce high quality honey, beeswax, and [[Mead|mead]]. The settlement makes additional revenue from trade up and down the mighty Sellen River, one of the most-traveled waterways in [[Avistan]], although its residents have little love for these migrants.
> The old city residents also detest the several hundred lumberjacks that come to Bellis for work each spring. Members of the "old families" view the transient lumberjacks as troublemakers they must tolerate since timber is a major part of the town's economy. When they are not at work, the newcomers spend their time drinking and fighting. Most of the lumberjacks reside in the Pit, which is a natural hollow adjacent to Sellen River filled with tents and shanties. The town authorities mostly ignore the Pit.


## Inhabitants

> [[Deegs Agraive]] is the Gavel of the [[Lumber Consortium]] in Bellis. He is assisted by Overboss [[Choms Snikt|Choms Chomber Snikt]].
