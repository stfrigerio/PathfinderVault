> **Khoka** is a town in north-eastern [[Qadira]] on the southern banks of the [[Pashman River]]. It is the last stop within Qadira for merchants traveling eastward into the heart of the [[Empire of Kelesh]], and the first way-station for caravans entering the satrapy. The town is full of caravans and mercenaries. A lot of bargains take place in Khoka and there are more rumors than could fill a hundred ears.
> Khoka's permanent population is small, only 920 people (residence permits are rarely granted), but it is adjacent to a garrison for the Keleshite Imperial Forces, which enforces customs taxation under the command of Captain Jathbiyyah al-Istiyaz. It also contains a temple to [[Falayna]].
> Khoka is surrounded by a smattering of small villages in the foothills of the [[Zho Mountains]], including the [[Ratfolk|ratfolk]] village of [[Khurbresh]], located in a canyon less than a day's travel away. The former way station Pilgrim's Rest, a temple to [[Sarenrae]] abandoned due to an earthquake-induced shift in the nearby river, lies on the old road between them.
> Caravans arriving from the [[Golden Path]] east of the town sometimes bring in travelers with a mysterious ailment that causes them to speak in tongues and their eyes to glow bright blue.
> [[Slaves]] who are particularly devout worshipers of [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|good-aligned]] [[Deities|deities]] fetch top coin in Khoka. The slaves are taken from town to the banks of the Pashman River and never seen again. They are destined for [[Nar-Voth]], where they are part of the plans of the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Moloch]].
