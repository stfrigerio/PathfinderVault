> **Numijaan** is the mostly ruined capital of [[Wanshou]] in [[Tian Xia]]. A pale shadow of its former self, Numijaan once boasted more than 170,000 residents before a series of disastrous storms and the emergence of the elder kraken [[Zhanagorr]] laid waste to it.


## Geography

> Much of Numijaan is underwater, with only the peaks of its tallest buildings visible above floodwaters or tsunami-wrecked shores.
