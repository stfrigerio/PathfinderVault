> **Heslandaena** is a subterranean settlement below the island of [[Dahak's Tooth|Dahaks Tooth]] in the [[Shackles]]. The cenotes that dot the island offer aquatic entry to miles of sea caves, which eventually emerge into unflooded, humid caverns. These moldy dark caves and passages lead to Heslandaena. The isolated town is inhabited by [[Drow|drow]] cut off from the [[Darklands]] many years ago by a [[Curse|curse]]. 
> The dark elves were part of the Harkule clan. They offended a powerful matriarch and were banished for their insolence. The isolated drow town is ruled by matriarch Pelanquelle, wicked and resentful for her exile. A number of [[Pirate|pirate]] captains know about the drow settlement and are trusted by its ruler: [[Adis Vraisdottir]], captain of the fast [[Ship|sloop]] *[[North Wind]]*, which sails out of [[Mezdrubal]]; [[White Hollis Dobilo]], captain of the [[Ship|brig]] *[[Stormrunner]]*, which sails from [[Drenchport]]; and [[Constanza Purgote]], captain of the sloop *[[Constanza's Whim|Constanzas Whim]]* which sails from [[Port Peril]]. 
> The three pirates, each unaware of the others, all have lucrative trading deals with matriarch Pelanquelle bringing foodstuffs and supplies in exchange for raw gemstones and rare subterranean substances.
