 Workers harvest papyrus in Tephu.
> **Tephu, the City of the Reed People** is a city in the [[Sphinx Basin]] region of [[Osirion]] named for the reed-covered marshlands where the rivers [[Crook River|Crook]] and [[Asp River|Asp]] join. The city's major industry is its near-monopoly on the harvest and processing of the abundant papyrus. Consequently, the city houses the largest academy of scribes in Osirion, who have preserved a massive catalogue of records from the time of its founding in [[-1605 AR]] by [[Djederet II]], [[Pharaoh|pharaoh]] and [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Nethys]]. Tephu's current leader is the preservationist governor: [[Deka An-Keret|Haty-a of Tephu Deka An-Keret]].
