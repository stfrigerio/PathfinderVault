> **Valishava** is a temple city sat along the banks of the holy [[Matra River]] in the [[Wide Water]] region of [[Vudra]]. The [[Deity|goddess]] [[Matravashii|Matravash]] is commonly worshipped here in huge waterside temples but the city also serves as a centre of commerce approximately half way along the river's length. The city is also famous for its high priest [[Razdara]] who leads her acolytes on pilgrimages into the [[Outer Sphere]]. Her most recent trip saw her return alone, looking deeply haunted and carrying predictions of some dire fate that she claims is soon to befall the people of Wide Water.
