> The mining town of **Brunderton** in eastern [[Rostland]] in [[Brevoy]] is home to a relatively large number of [[Dwarf|dwarves]] for the region. Most dwarves throughout southern Brevoy and the northern [[River Kingdoms]] have relatives from here, and gem and ore traders from Brunderton can often be found peddling their wares along the [[Sellen River|Sellens]] many tributaries.
