## History

> Kazuhn has been economically battered by limited infrastructural maintenance due to centuries of exploitation. What remains is almost solely dedicated to keeping the few key canals and warehouses operational that are able to export the prefecture's flax, fruit, and grain, as this remains a vital export to Oppara. In Taldor's heyday, Kazuhn was a patchwork of small, family-run farms but nobles long ago consolidated these farms into massive estates with tenant farmers.
