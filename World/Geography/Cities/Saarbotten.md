> **Saarbotten** is a border town on the [[Thundering River]] in the [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province known as the [[Verge]].
> Saarboten is organized entirely toward the support of the raiding parties that cross the border south and west into the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. The town hosts permanent armories, camps and warehouses. The [[Wintercrux]] town of [[Dalun]] has the responsibility to supply Saarbotten's food while [[Morozny]] and [[Vasterborg]] provide weapons and armor. [[Urgalaena|Baroness Urgalaena]] is the bloodthirsty, enthusiastic ruler of the town, mocking publicly her sister [[Nadya|Baroness Nadya]] of Dalun for her diplomatic efforts in order to improve trade with the [[Ulfen]] people. Baroness Urgalaena hosts the vicious "Crimson Tournaments" every week.
> Saarbotten is opposite the lands of [[Southmoor]] and [[Ysborg]] to the south and the eastern part of the [[Grungir Forest]] to the west. The nearest Ulfen settlements are the village of [[Whiterook]] in Southmoor and [[Losthome]] in the Grungir Forest. Saarbotten is also close to the [[Gnome|gnome]] village of [[Delmon's Glen|Delmons Glen]] in the forest.
