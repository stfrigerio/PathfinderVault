> The **Slave City of Awaiting-Consumption** is the largest [[Slavery|slave]]-city on [[Abaddon]] and the only such city to be open to non-[[Daemon|daemons]].



## Government

> Awaiting-Consumption is ruled by the daemonic [[Harbinger|harbinger]] [[Jacarkas]], who strives to keep the [[Soul|soul]] trade healthy.


## Inhabitants

 
 The [[Unholy symbol|unholy symbol]] of Lao Shu Po.
> The majority of Awaiting-Consumption's population are the daemons' captive mortal livestock, hand-picked for their bloodlines, failures, transgressions, and spiritual blemishes. The daemons and assorted creatures breed these cultists, trade them as goods, train them as specialised slaves or gladiators, and ensure that they are as delicious as possible when devoured.
> As the only slave-city open to non-daemons, Awaiting-Consumption is one of the few places in Abaddon where emissaries, merchants, and visitors can be found alongside the daemons and hunted [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Petitioner|petitioners]]. These visitors pay heavily for seals of protection from the daemons and their [[Insane|insane]] mortal slaves.


### Lao Shu Po

> The [[Deity|goddess]] [[Lao Shu Po]], a long-time denizen of Abaddon, makes her home in the alleys and sewers of Awaiting-Consumption.
