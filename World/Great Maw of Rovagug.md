The Great Maw of Rovagug.
> The **Great Maw of Rovagug** is the second-largest bombard ever constructed, measuring 81 inches in diameter, boasting a range of eight to nineteen miles, and firing three-ton shells capable of leaving a 60-foot crater on impact. Manufactured by the [[Gunworks]] of [[Alkenstar]] around [[4500 AR]], this massive cannon has been fired only twice as of [[4709 AR]]: the first as a demonstration, and the second to ward off three rampaging sandkrakens headed for the city.
> Despite its lack of frequent use, the Great Maw is ever-ready, built into the face of the [[Hellfallen Cliffs]] overlooking the approach to Alkenstar through the [[Mana Wastes]]. After being fired, 14 men must spend a full hour to reload it.
> These days, the bombard is used to deter [[Giant|giant]] incursions from the mountains to the west, or a second invasion by the [[Gorilla King]].
