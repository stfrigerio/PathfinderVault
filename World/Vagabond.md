> **Vagabonds** are called the people without jobs, in [[Taldor]]. They often press-ganged into day labor by the nobility, and sometimes are even sold as galley slaves to the [[Zimar Corsairs]]. In [[Oppara]] docks, it is not uncommon to see a crowd of filthy peasants chained together at the neck, waiting for their owner's ship. Many of Taldor's vagabonds gather together in the wilds of the empire, and are organized into gangs or pirate bands. There are even vagabond camps beneath the streets of Oppara and [[Cassomir]]. The largest camp of vagabonds, called [[Grandbridge Vagabond Camp]], is a massive camp of more than a thousand unemployed peasants, on the south shore of the [[Porthmos River]], across the [[Grand Bridge of the Empire|Grand Bridge]] from Oppara.
