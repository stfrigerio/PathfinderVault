 A volcano is the [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] of [[Yamatsumi]].
> A **volcano** is a mountain or rupture in the earth that allows hot lava, ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. Three broad types of volcano exist: 

> - cinder cones are made up of compacted ash and volcanic debris, and most erupt only briefly before becoming inactive;
> - shield volcanoes are low and broad, due to the lava they erupt flowing for large distances before cooling;
> - stratovolcanoes are steeply sloped and much higher than the other two types, the lava they erupt tending to cool quickly and before it can flow very far.
> A volcano's activity may cause its magma reservoirs to empty out, at which point the mountain may collapse into the resulting cavern to form a crater-like caldera. A caldera may still remain volcanically active, as is the case with those containing the [[Gorum Pots]] of [[Numeria]] and [[Terwa Lake]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. Volcanoes often arise in areas where the boundaries between the [[Material Plane]] and the [[Plane of Fire]] are thin.
> Despite their hostile natures, volcanoes are often home to a variety of creature such as [[Fire giant|fire giants]], [[Red dragon|red]], [[Magma dragon|magma]] and [[Underworld dragon|underworld dragons]], [[Fire elemental|fire]] and [[Magma elemental|magma elementals]], [[Thoqqua|thoqquas]], [[Fire whale|fire whales]] and [[Magma ooze|magma oozes]].
