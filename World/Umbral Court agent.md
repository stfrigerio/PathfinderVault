## On Golarion


### In Nidal

> In their official standing, Umbral Court agents operate out of [[Ridwan]] or [[Pangolais]]. Most of these agents are tasked with maintaining the purity of [[Zon-Kuthon|Kuthite]] rule by eliminating inappropriate influences. Ambitious agents in Pangolais go so far as to become [[Vampire|vampires]] or other forms of [[Undead|undead]] to increase their power.


### Elsewhere

> Agents who work abroad quietly or covertly seek positions of power in rival governments.


## Abilities

> Much like Nidalese [[Shadowdancer|shadowdancers]], Umbral Court agents can harness and wield shadows and empower shadow-related [[Spell|spells]]. They also share (and are immune to) the [[Velstrac|velstracs]] unnerving gaze.
> Umbral Court agents are skilled in the use of spiked chains as [[Weapon|weapons]].
