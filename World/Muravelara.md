> **Muravelara** is the name of one of the realms, an [[Abyssal realm]], of the Hag Queen [[Gyronna]]. Muravelara is a seemingly sylvan realm perverted to the darkness of the Angry Hag. Within the woodlands, women rule while hapless men are hunted as prey. Because she has other realms in addition to Muravelara, Gyronna is often absent.
