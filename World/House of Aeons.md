> Located in in [[Azlant]], the **House of Aeons** is a broad, round tower, perched on the edge of a scarcely bigger spire. It was built by the earliest [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] [[Human|humans]] in honour of the [[Aeon|aeons]], whom they venerated as architects who created the [[Material Plane]] from primordial [[Chaos|chaos]]. Annually, they would honour the aeons by making statuettes of themselves as an act of personal artifice, and offering them to the aeons. The greatest treasures in the House of Aeons are *[[Ioun stone|ioun stones]]* which come in numerous types and forms embedded in its walls and piled upon its altars; according to Azlanti legend, they were the tools used by the aeons to create the universe.
> The House of Aeons was discovered by [[Pathfinder]] agent [[Durvin Gest]] on his first expedition to Azlant, and the secrets unearthed there led him to numerous other exploits in the lost empire. He plundered numerous tiny statues and *ioun stones* from the House of Aeons; these treasures later either funded [[Skyreach]], the headquarters of the [[Pathfinder Society]] in [[Absalom]], or still adorn it to this day.
> The tunnels beneath the House of Aeons are still home to some degenerate creatures, including an unthinkably powerful, [[Magic|magically]]-warped aeon. When intruders approach, the lesser degenerates first spy on them, then try to scare them away with sounds of scratching on stones; if this fails, they then swarm forth, intent on chasing interlopers away or bringing them back to the aeon in the deepest tunnel.
