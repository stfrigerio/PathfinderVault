> The **Isgeri** were a collection of at least 11 [[Kellid]] tribes that inhabited the land between the [[Menador Mountains]] and [[Five Kings Range]] of central [[Avistan]]. In [[2133 AR]], the [[Taldor|Taldan]] [[Army of Exploration|Seventh Army of Exploration]] invaded and pacified the tribe, establishing a new protectorate there. They eventually named it [[Isger]] as a mark of respect to the courage of the people they had defeated.
