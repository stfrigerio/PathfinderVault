 Thief Camp is shown in the near side of this panorama of Korvosa, just to the right of the walled off East Shore neighborhood.
> Located north of the [[Korvosa|Korvosan]] neighborhood of [[East Shore]] on the far shore of the [[Jeggare River]], the derogatorily known **Thief Camp** is a semi-permanent tent camp inhabited largely by local [[Varisian|Varisians]] and [[Shoanti]] who cannot find acceptance (or do not wish to be accepted) in the rest of the otherwise [[Chelaxian]]-majority city. The southern end of the neighborhood (south of [[North Bridge]]) has a few houses and shops that cater to outsiders from elsewhere in the region.
