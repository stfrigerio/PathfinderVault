> One of the two systems of canals that run through the [[Oppidan Maze]] of [[Dis]], the **Lethe** guides the [[River Styx]] through the infernal city. Unlike the [[Andramal]], which is only allowed to be used by the city's nobility, the Lethe is open to public use and serves as a main route of transportation for [[Mortal|mortals]], [[Planar|planar]] traders, the [[Undead|undead]], lesser [[Devil|devils]], servants of lesser deities, or anyone else who is traveling through or calls Dis their home.
