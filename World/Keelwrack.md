> **Keelwrack** is the district that covers the two islands of [[Dunrock]] and [[Keelwrack Island]] that lies to the east of the rest of the city of [[Vyre]], separated by the shallow [[Keelwrack Harbor]]. The two islands are very different in nature: Keelwrack is home to many of the city's government buildings including the architecturally magnificent [[Vyre Palace]]; while Dunrock is only home to [[Dunrock Prison]], one of the most notorious prisons in all [[Avistan]].
