> The seemingly chaotic **Kalsgard Shipyards** lie along the southern banks of the [[Rimeflow River]] within the [[Oak Quarter]] of [[Kalsgard]]. Though the individual yards are independently owned by various families, they come together in a **shipbuilders' guild**. The yards are famous for the superior quality of the longships they produce, bringing in customers from throughout the seven kingdoms of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. [[Sigfastr Gunnarsen]] is the current **Master of Shipyards** and is, himself, a master shipwright.
> Many who live in the Oak Quarter supply the Shipyards, including craftsmen, woodcarvers and carpenters. Possibly most famous are the **Guhailla** family clan who carve exquisite [[Linnorm|linnorm]] figureheads that are viewed as high status items and are believed to bring luck to the longships on which they are mounted.
