> **Grubber's Hermitage** is a small island west of [[Sandpoint]] that has had the misfortune of causing a number of shipwrecks over the years. A few fishing families live on the island. Visitors are not welcomed or encouraged. Rumors in Sandpoint are that the island is home to lepers or [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghosts]]. In [[4707 AR]] all contact between the island and Sandpoint was lost and several passing ships reported large numbers of carrion birds in the area as the locals were enslaved by the [[Red Bishop]], a [[Mothman|mothman]] [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Pazuzu]], as part of his plan to turn the [[Pit Sandpoint hinterlands|Pit]] into a portal to the realm of the [[Demon|demon]] [[Uvaglor]] in the [[Abyss]] so he could bring ruin to the [[Lost Coast]].
