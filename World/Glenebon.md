> One of the harsher regions of [[Stolen Lands|the Stolen Lands]], if not the entire [[River Kingdoms]], the region of **Glenebon**, also called the **Glenebon Uplands**, is characterized by rolling black hills, tall gray grass, and tangled scrub, scoured by harsh winds and summer brush fires.
> There is little shelter to be found in this unforgiving land. Wildlife includes [[Beetle|beetles]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Snake|snakes]], rodents, and ragged [[Wolf|wolves]], but it is said that prides of [[Manticore|manticores]] have taken to the region, ranging from the Branthlend Mountains, across the hills of Glenebon and into [[Numeria]].
> The Glenebon Uplands are controlled by the River Kingdom of [[Pitax]].
