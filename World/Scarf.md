 A *scarf of storytelling*.
> A **scarf** is a traditional [[Varisian]] garment made of colorful or transparent cloth, [[Silk|silk]], or wool. In addition to keeping the wearer warm, scarves are used to distract potential marks and preserve a family's history. Scarves can be modified to be [[Pocketed scarf|pocketed]] or [[Reinforced scarf|reinforced]], and some contain [[World/Items & Equipment/Weapons/Bladed scarf|concealed blades]] that allow them to be used as [[Weapon|weapons]].
