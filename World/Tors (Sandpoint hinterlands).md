> The **Tors** east of [[Sandpoint]] are three sets of rocky hills that contain many small hideaways, [[Varisian]] tombs, and other secrets. The names for these hills, [[Leb's Tors|Lebs Tors]], [[Rigg's Tors|Riggs Tors]], and [[Task's Tors|Tasks Tors]] come from the adventurers who most explored them before the founding of Sandpoint.
