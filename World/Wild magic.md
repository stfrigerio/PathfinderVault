> The raw form of [[Magic|magic]] is known as **wild magic** (also known as **primal magic**). It lies beyond the borders of reality, but can be drawn upon by spellcasters. It is a [[Chaos|chaotic]] force, and can be found in the [[Great Beyond]] in areas attuned to chaos, such as the [[Maelstrom]] and the [[Abyss]].
> In [[Golarion]], wild magic is only able to manifest in areas where the laws of reality have been weakened, most commonly in the devastated area between [[Nex]] and [[Geb's Rest]] known as the [[Mana Wastes]]. It might also occur in areas which have suffered the wrath of the [[Deity|gods]], or when a powerful [[Artifact|artifact]] is destroyed.
> A manifestation normally follows an accumulation of primal energy, which then explodes into existence in the [[Material Plane]]. The effects are unpredictable, and range from the weird (a burst strange music, or a rain of rotten fruit) to the dangerous (a firestorm sweeps through the area, or all creatures present are lashed by [[Negative Energy Plane|negative energy]]).
