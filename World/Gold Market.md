> **Gold Market** is the largest marketplace in the city of [[Korvosa]] and the central attraction of the [[Midland]] district. Located between [[Eodred Circle]] and Eodred's Walk, people flock from across the city to visit its stalls and stands. Gold Market features local goods from not just Korvosa and it holdings but from across [[Varisia]]. The market is rife with food stalls of every sort, it has been speculated that as many as half the population of Korvosa eats here each month. One of the semi-regular features of the market is [[Sagitar Tiguan]], a merchant who sells a range of trinkets and elixirs that he claims are magical. Whenever Sagitar's brightly coloured stall is there, adventurers are sure to be found nearby.
