> The **Nyvyrd**, or **Warmth Water**, is a massive freshwater lake that hugs the [[Icewall]] glaciers on [[Iobaria|Iobarias]] northern edges whose warm waters steam in the arctic air. The depths of the Nyvyrd teem with an incredible variety of [[Fish|fish]] and sea life, including predators of such monstrous proportions that sailors refuse to venture beyond the lake's shores. These shores are home to massive beds of shellfish, which are both a local stable and source of an astounding variety of pearls, including ice pearls and striped pearls, and shells that are as hard as tempered steel. A strange, opalescent dome known as [[Oroskirr]] rises from the lake, and locals presume it has something to do with the Nyvyrd's unusual warmth.
> The Nyvyrd is ringed by [[Antoll]], the former capital of Iobaria; the fort town of [[Veka]], home of the region's current ruler, the despotic [[Rjul|Koffar Rjul]];; and hundreds of smaller settlements, cabins, and [[Taldor|Taldan-style]] villas. Many of these towns are abandoned or inhabited by brigands, either because of plagues or forced evictions by nobles desiring control over access the Nyvard's warm waters.
