> The **Pit of Zedoran** is a vast sinkhole within the depths of the [[PathfinderWiki/Fangwood|Northern Fangwood]]. Streams of water cascade down its sides, carrying leaves and organic debris. The layers of moss and lichen are covering hanging vines and ancient roots. The forest canopy is thick allowing little [[Sun|sunlight]] to reach the moss-covered earth.  It is the lair of the [[Green dragon|green dragon]] [[Zedoran]]. At the edge of the central pit is a wooden cage lift, manually operated by Zedoran's minions. There are two cages, one at the top and the other at the bottom of the pit and each cage is large enough to hold eight men.
