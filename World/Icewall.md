> The **Icewall** is a series of glaciers that border northern [[Mendev]] and [[Iobaria]], as well as the northern coast of the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]]. The warm waters of [[The Nyvyrd]] lap the Icewall's southern edges, while the [[Ice Steppes]] border the glaciers to the east.
> [[Franax|Franaxs]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of the [[Glacircle]] worship an elemental power they believe to be embedded within the Icewall and the tundra.
