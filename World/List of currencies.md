 A pile of currency.
> Most commerce on [[Golarion]] is transacted in some combination of **gold**, **silver**, and **copper pieces**. While rates might regionally vary, ten copper pieces are generally worth one [[Silver|silver]] piece, ten silver pieces are worth one [[Gold|gold]] piece, and ten gold pieces are worth one **[[Platinum|platinum]] piece**.
> Because of increased trade in the [[Inner Sea region]], there has also been increased standardization of currency weight and pureness, to the point where nearly any coin of a given type minted in one country can be exchanged for a similar foreign coin. Despite this useful standardization, each nation (and sometimes each city) mints its own currency.


## On Golarion


### Absalom

> [[Absalom]]'s currency consists of *copper pennies*, *silver weights*, *electrum crests*, *gold measures*, and *platinum sphinxes*. The [[Absalom Mint]] collects, melts, and re-mints the coins of other nations.

Copper penny
Absalom does not regularly mint *pennies*, typically using varied denominations for minor transactions. Occasionally an adventuring party, hero, or other special event will be commemorated by a limited mintage of these coins.
Silver weight
A "weight", always of silver, is the standard unit of commerce, even for very large transactions.
Electrum crest
Absalom no longer mints *crests*, but some were created during ancient crises as coins of mixed silver, gold, and copper. They are accepted only in Absalom at the same value as a silver weight.
Gold measure
Absalom's coin is the weight of a full measure of gold, and the standard by which such coins are assessed.
Platinum sphinx
These "lion-coins" are used in exchanges between large mercantile houses, and depict the [[Mother-sphinx|mother-sphinx]] on the obverse and [[Azlanti Keep]] on the reverse.

 [[Dragon|Dragons]] and [[Linnorm|linnorms]] greedily hoard gold coins.

### Alkenstar

> [[Alkenstar|Alkenstars]] official currency is an octagonal doubloon; each coin has a unique serial number and the seal of the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar printed on it. The coins are called 'luckies' by Alkenstarians.


### Andoran

> In [[Andoran]] the coins are named as follows: *copper caps*, silver wolves, gold sails, and platinum falcons.


### Brevoy

> The people of [[Brevoy]] use copper bits, silver links, gold crowns, and platinum dragons.


### Katapesh

> The [[Katapesh|Katapeshi]] have copper grains, silver pennies, gold scarabs, and platinum genies.


### Numeria

Silverdisks
[[Silverdisk|Silverdisks]] are small, etched silver disks frequently used in place of currency by the people of [[Numeria]].

### Osirion

> The gold coins of [[Osirion]] are known as gold scarabs.


### River Kingdoms


##### Pitax

> Merchants deal in gold shivs in [[Pitax]].


### Varisia


#### Korvosa

 A Korvosan gold sail.
> The [[Bank of Abadar Korvosa|Bank of Abadar]] in the [[North Point]] district of [[Korvosa]] mints coins which are legal tender throughout [[Varisia]]. The names for the various coins are:

Copper Pinch
Both the singular and plural term for the [[Korvosa|Korvosan]] copper coin is *pinch* and never *pinches*.
Silver Shield
The silver coins are always referred to as *silver shields*, and never simply as silvers.
Gold Sail
Like silver shields, gold coins are never abbreviated, and are always *gold sails*.
Platinum Crown
The platinum coins are either platinum crowns or just crowns.

#### Magnimar

> In [[Magnimar]], gold sails are discussed and this is likely a reference to Korvosan currency, as Korvosan coins are legal tender throughout Varisia.


## On other planes

> [[Devil|Devils]], [[Demon|demons]], and [[Night hag|night hags]] trade for or steal souls for eternal servitude or to use them as [[Currency|currency]]. In [[Erebus]], souls are broken apart into soul fragments and used as currency.
