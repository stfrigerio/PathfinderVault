> **Lawful good** characters act as a [[Good|good]] person is expected or required to act, combining a commitment to oppose [[Evil|evil]] with the discipline to fight relentlessly. Telling the truth, keeping one's word, helping those in need, and speaking out against injustice are all paramount behaviors of the [[Law|lawful]] good, and a character of this [[Alignment|alignment]] hates to see the guilty go unpunished.

> Lawful good characters are the crusaders of [[Golarion]]. Typically driven by religious zeal or a fervent sense of justice, these characters are often willing to take extreme personal risk to do what is right. Not only do these characters go out of their way to help those in need and expunge the world of evil, they make it their way, setting all other goals aside in light of what they see as their duty. While members of many classes can be lawful good, the ideal class for this alignment is the [[Paladin|paladin]], whose divine connection and devotion to their strict code of honor bind them to both the good and lawful ends of the spectrum.


## Gods

> Lawful good deities tend to be those most at odds with the forces of evil and, to a lesser extent, chaos. Typically known for their abilities to heal and protect, a lawful good god is equally capable of waging war and destruction if her enemy represents evil. Worshipers of lawful good gods usually live strict and structured lives filled with personal sacrifice and religious fervor. Lawful good members of Golarion's major pantheon include [[Erastil]], [[Iomedae]], and [[Torag]].


## Nations

> A nation with the lawful good alignment is one in which strict laws protect its citizens, evil is not tolerated, and the poor are cared for. Chaotic characters may find these locations to be difficult to navigate socially and legally, but if one is conscious of the local laws and customs, it is usually possible to stay out of trouble. An example of a lawful good nation in Golarion is [[Mendev]], in which armies of paladins constantly crusade to repulse the [[Demon|demonic]] hordes that swell forth from the [[Worldwound]].
