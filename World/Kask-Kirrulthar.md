> **Kask-Kirrulthar** is the largest of the three [[Cyclops|cyclops]] watchtowers from the age of the [[Koloran Empire]], though it stands at the same height as [[Fralros]] and [[Hask-Ultharan]]. Located in western [[Iobaria]], the tower is inhabited by [[Wraith|wraith-like]] creatures, who vary in appearance and size from [[Human|human children]] to [[Dragon|dragons]], and hunt the surrounding lands out to two miles for the living on nights when the [[Moon Golarion|moon]] does not shine in the sky.
