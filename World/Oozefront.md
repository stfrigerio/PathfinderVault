> **Oozefront** extends from east to west across all of [[Urglin]], separating [[Warmouth]] from the other districts. It serves as the city's primary bazaar, though, a acrid stench permeates this part of the city, emanating from the foul-smelling, sludge-like Ooze, the river granting the district its name. Shoppers don't seem to be too worried about the smell as it hasn't affected business in the marketplace. The river, Ooze, cuts the section in two, and Urglinites use the channel to dispose of their waste, adding to the waterway's consistency and stench. The only drinkable liquid from this "river" lies along the western wall, where the river enters the city; to the east, the river stagnates outside the city in Pussbubble Lake. A bridge on the western side of **Oozefront** leads to [[Bonerattle]], while the eastern one leads directly to the lake's shore.
