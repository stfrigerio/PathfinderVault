> **Kuthan** is the name of the sun-blasted [[Abyssal realm]] of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Nurgal]]. It is a mix of desert and savannah all burnt by a huge red [[Sun|sun]] that is forever directly overhead: it is always noon. 
> Long gorges from Kuthan connect to the abyssal realm called the [[Sea of Whispering Sands]] as that realm was once ruled by [[Areshkagal]], Nurgal's lover. Areshkagal's sister, [[Aldinach]], however, fought and forced Areshkagal into exile in her current realm of the [[Blood Clefts]].
