> After [[An-Hepsu VII]], also known as the Pharaoh of Blades, founded the mighty fortress-city of [[Ipeq]] in [[-2385 AR]], he used the enormous force of his [[Genie|genie]] servants to build a tomb deep beneath the city. This tomb is known as the **Tomb of the Pharaoh of Blades**, and its twisted, labyrinthine corridors and burial chambers were designed and [[Curse|cursed]] to confuse and trap grave robbers. An-Hepsu VII was buried in the tomb after his mysterious murder in [[-2359 AR]]. His vengeful spirit became imprisoned in the maze of his own design, and after millennia of impotent rage was driven mad; it remains there to this day. [[Undead]] versions of the pharaoh's favored warriors accompany him in the form of armed [[Mummy|mummies]] known as the [[Black Reckoners]]. The crypt is also home to the pharaoh's undead lover, [[Chigaret Nerfauner]].
