> **Mulaa** is a [[Mwangi]] tribe in [[Sargava]]. Like the [[Kalabuta]], the Mulaa work with the colonials, usually in and around the [[Anthusis|Eleder]]. They dress in colorful shawls and veils. Sometimes, the other Mwangi see them as traitors but unlike the Kalabuta, Mulaa didn't adopt the colonials' culture and often young members of the tribe are involved in anticolonial protests and violence.
