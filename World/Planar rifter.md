> A **planar rifter** is a [[Gunslinger|gunslinger]] who has mastered the absorption and condensation of [[Plane|planar matter]], which allows them to harness and attune themselves to other planes while also forming bullets infused with [[Planar essence|planar essence]].
> The practices were invented by followers of the [[Daemon|daemonic]] [[Harbinger|harbinger]] [[Cixyron]], who mastered ways to harvest and absorb matter of [[Abaddon]] itself, and further learned to infuse it into [[Firearm|firearm]] ammunition. However, those practices and methods have also spread to others who do not share the same daemonic faith.
