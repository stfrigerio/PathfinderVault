> **Phantasmagoria's Maw** is the doorway between the [[Ethereal Plane]] proper and [[Xibalba]], a [[Demiplane|demiplane]] hidden in the Ethereal Plane and home of the [[Sahkil|sahkils]]. Outwardly, Phantasmagoria's Maw manifests on the Ethereal Plane as a vile mountain made of ectoplasm, sharp spires, and roots drifting into numerous [[Planet|planets]] on the [[Material Plane]]. Its interior is even more horrific: due to their mastery of [[Teleportation|teleportation]], sahkils do not need conventional architecture; the most accessible parts of Phantasmagoria's Maw are death traps, while important chambers are hidden by [[Illusion|illusions]] or accessible only via teleportation. On the peak of Phantasmagoria's Maw is the portal to Xibalba, which pours its horror into the Ethereal Plane and attracts swarms of [[Allip|allips]] and [[Unfettered phantom|phantoms]].
