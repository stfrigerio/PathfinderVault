> **Novosis** are flat-bodied amphibians that burrow through the snow of the [[Crown of the World]], using their bony jaws to grind the surface ice and suck up [[Bore-worm|bore-worms]]. The [[Erutaki human ethnicity|Erutaki]] sometimes "fish" for novosis by digging shallow pits, tossing in a handful of bore-worms as bait, and waiting for the novosis to surface so they can spear the amphibians.
