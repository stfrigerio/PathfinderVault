> **Lead** (pronounced LED) is a chemical element most commonly found on [[Golarion]] in the form of a malleable, dense [[Metal|metal]]. Although it is a mundane material, it interacts uniquely with certain phenomena.



## Radiation

![[Blightburn.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Blightburn]], a [[Radioactive|radioactive]] material whose effects can be blocked by lead.
***Main article: [[Radiation]]***
> Lead can block radiation, and is often used as in shielding designed to protect against the effects of, or contain, radioactive materials. For example, lead containers can more safely store highly [[Toxic|toxic]] radioactive [[Blightburn|blightburn]] than those made of other materials, and the [[Spell|spell]] *lead plating* encloses objects or creatures in a lead sheath to protect them from radiation.
> Containers for radioactive [[Alchemical item|alchemical items]], such as blightburn paste, can also be lined with lead to contain their noxious and disruptive effects.


## Divination

***Main article: [[Magic/Divination]]***
> Lead also interferes with or blocks many divination spells and [[Magic|magical]] effects. Encasing a compartment, room, or building in lead can prevent divination spells from revealing its contents, making lead-lined containers valuable implements in smuggling operations and security. For instance, the rumored Golden Vaults of Abadar beneath [[Korvosa|Korvosas]] [[Bank of Abadar Korvosa|Bank of Abadar]] are lined with lead to defend against divination.


## Other magical effects

> Lead-lined [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] or clothing are also sometimes used to protect against magical effects, such as [[Curse|curses]] or auras.


## Non-magical properties

> In addition to its ability to block radiation and magical effects, lead is also highly toxic. This is occasionally exploited by [[Golem|golem]] makers in the creation of [[Lead golem|lead golems]], which when struck shed clouds of toxic dust to harm their attackers.


## Variants

Soul-lead
Formed as an alloy of lead and [[Soul|souls]] in the [[Demon|demon]] city of [[Iz]], soul-lead is then forged into [[Abyss|Abyssal]] [[Construct|constructs]] at the Soul Foundry.
