 Septisaeus is on the far right.
> The white [[Apocalypse horse|apocalypse horse]] **Septisaeus** is the mount of [[Apollyon|Apollyon the Horseman of Pestilence]]. This advanced [[Nightmare|nightmare]] bears a [[Gold|golden]] crown marked with its master's symbol and a neck punctured by a dozen barbed arrows. Septisaeus seems healthy at first glance, but upon closer inspection bears the signs of horrific infections: sclera black with ocular bleeding, cracked gums and teeth, a frothing mouth, and purpuric blemishes marring its extremities.
