> **Seven's Sawmill** is the oldest of the six major sawmills on [[Kyver's Islet|Kyvers Islet]] in [[Magnimar]] and has never changed ownership. Production occurs here, but not in significant volumes, because it is used as the meeting place of the secret society called the [[Brothers of the Seven]]. Few know of the group or the meetings.
