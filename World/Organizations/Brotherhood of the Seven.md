> The **Brotherhood of the Seven** (or **Brothers of the Seven** as they are sometimes known) is a [[Skinsaw cult]] headquartered in the [[Ordellia|Ordellia district]] of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]]. This secret [[Norgorber]] cult meets in [[Seven's Sawmill|Sevens Sawmill]] on [[Kyver's Islet|Kyvers Islet]], and is made up of seven members of Magnimar's minor aristocracy. Their exact goals are unknown, although it is suspected that one of the cult's founders created the hideous [[Flesh golem|flesh golem]] known as the [[Scarecrow Magnimar|Scarecrow]].
