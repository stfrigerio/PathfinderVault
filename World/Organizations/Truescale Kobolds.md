> The Truescale Kobolds are a powerful clan of [[Kobold|kobolds]] native to the [[Darkmoon Vale]] region of [[Andoran]]. Their tribal realm included the caverns deep beneath the ruined [[Dwarf|dwarven]] monastery of [[Droskar's Crucible|Droskars Crucible]]. During the reign of King [[Merlokrep]], the clan moved from the ever more dangerous depths into the layers above their traditional warrens. In [[4707 AR]], the Truescales abducted five children from the town of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] for sacrifice, but their plans were foiled, and their king was slain by adventurers in the area.
