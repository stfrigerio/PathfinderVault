> The **Koboto** were the ruling caste of the lost nation of [[Yamasa]] (the southern part of what is now the [[Sodden Lands]]). They survived the destruction of their country by the [[Eye of Abendego]] by defying their ancient taboos in order to engage in [[Cannibalism|cannibalism]] and foul [[Necromancy|necromancy]].
> They have a tribal culture led by [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]], and worship three [[Deities|deities]] who they refer to as the *Sar-Gorog*, or [[Three Feasters]]. They believe that by appeasing these three foul beings they can prevent further disasters striking their homeland. They regularly sacrifice non-Koboto to these gods, requiring them to launch raids in search of new victims. Some of these raids are made against [[Ship|ships]] sailing closely to their flooded coastline.
> Tribal chieftains wear fearsome [[Goz mask|goz masks]].
> The Koboto gather each summer in [[Kokutang]], Yamasa's drowned capital.
