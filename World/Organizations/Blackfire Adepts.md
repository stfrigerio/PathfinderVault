*See also: [[Blackfire Adept]]*
> In places where the borders between [[Plane|planes]] are thin or torn, reality itself burns with an ebony flame known as [[Blackfire|blackfire]]. Taking their name from this phenomenon, the **Blackfire Adepts** are a group of loosely associated arcane explorers,  mystics, and [[Demon|demonologists]]. They journey through the many planes of the [[Great Beyond]] in an effort to acquire dark powers from otherworldly entities, with an alleged goal of unraveling the [[Multiverse|multiverse]] itself.



## History

> The Blackfire Adepts once held great power among the ruling [[Arclords of Nex]], but fell from power in the last years of the [[Age of Enthronement]]. They have since scattered to every corner of [[Golarion]].


## Appearance

> Most regular members of the group clothe themselves in red robes with fiery black trim, while their leaders hide among the academic leaders of the world.


## Relations

> They are sworn enemies of the group known as the [[Riftwardens]], who try to oppose them at every turn. Similarly, the Blackfire Adepts are opposed to the Concordance of Elements who try to repair the damage to planar boundaries that the Blackfire Adepts cause.


## Favored familiars

> These planar travelers often select [[Outsider|outsider]] [[Familiar|familiars]] who share their [[Evil|evil]] tendencies. This includes [[Cacodaemon|cacodaemons]], [[Imp|imps]], [[Quasit|quasits]], and [[Voidworm|voidworms]].
