> The **Wise Council of Three** rules the island of [[Shenchu Bay]] in the [[Shackles]]. Council members are elected from all Shenchu [[Free Captains]] and serve for three years. The current council members are [[Jieh Hui]] the body's leader, who is very old, the devious [[Lo Shei Wen]] who specializes in the trade of [[Slavery|slaves]], and [[Chan Ai-Huao]] who is greatly favored by the voteless common sailors of the island's ships.
