> **Almas University** is [[Andoran|Andorans]] premier educational institution, and is located in the [[North End]] district of [[Almas]], just north of the [[Field of Concord]]. Even though it is technically open to any Andoren citizen, it accepts only a limited number of new students, which means that competition is fierce, despite the significant cost to attend. [[Felandriel Morgethai]] is the school's provost, and has held the position for over 100 years.



## Subjects of Study

> Almas University's main fields of study are law, politics, [[Philosophy|modern philosophy]], and zoology.


## Scholars of the University

> [[Jalus Ebincott]] is Professor of [[Mwangi Expanse|Mwangi]] Studies, with a particular knowledge of the [[Charau-ka|charau-ka]]. The school's provost, Felandriel Morgethai, is a very well respected scholar in her own right. Of lesser stature than the first two is [[Chulo Varotien|Professor Chulo Varotien]], a chatty don who loves to gossip.


## History

> Almas University was once under the direct control of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] [[House Leroung]]. Even though the university has distanced itself quite significantly from the noble house since the [[People's Revolt|Peoples Revolt]], members of the university still hold the Leroung family in high regard due to their many contributions to academia.
> In [[4673 AR]], Almas University sponsored a research expedition to explore the recently discovered [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] ruin of [[Sech Nevali]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. The team ran into competition from a similar group from the [[University of Korvosa]], but were eventually able to reach a truce with them. Study of the ancient site has continued these last few decades, but only a small number of researchers now remain, led by the quirky [[Milithus]] of [[Cassomir]]. Recently, the heads of Almas University are beginning to worry, as they have not heard from the team in months.
