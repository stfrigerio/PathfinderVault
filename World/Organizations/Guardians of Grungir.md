> The **Guardians of Grungir** are a group of [[Ulfen]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] who protect the [[Grungir Forest]] from [[Human|human]] encroachment but also contain many of the most violent [[Fey|fey]] or other monsters of the woods. The result is that the Guardians do not have many friends but they are satisfied knowing that Grungir Forest is protected.
