> The former ruling house of [[Brevoy]], **House Rogarvia**â€”informally, the **Rogarvians**â€”was founded by the descendants of [[Choral the Conqueror]] and [[Myrna Rogarvia]], daughter of [[Nikos Surtova]]. Choral united [[Rostland]] and [[Issia]] into the kingdom of Brevoy after invading from [[Iobaria]], accompanied by [[Dragon|dragons]]. Most members of the House, including King [[Urzen Rogarvia]], disappeared mysteriously in [[4699 AR]], in an event called the "[[Vanishing]]". Their loss is not greatly mourned by the Brevic people and loyalists are calling for an investigation instead of blind allegiance to [[Noleski Surtova]], who declared himself king.
> The House built the [[Ruby Fortress]] in [[New Stetven]] on the shores of [[Lake Reykal]] as their stronghold. The Rogarvians were known to be ruthless rulers who did their best to hold Brevoy's disparate houses and factions together.


## Heraldry

> A two-headed [[Red dragon|red dragon]] is the family's [[Heraldry|crest]]. One head of the dragon breathes fire while the other wields a [[Sword|sword]]. The house motto is "With Sword and Flame."


## Rumors

> There are many rumors relating to the House's sudden disappearance. Some of the most popular are that Choral the Conqueror was a dragon, and as such his blood was cursed. Eventually that blood consumed and destroyed all of his descendants. Another posits that House Rogarvia's founder pledged his descendants' blood in return for his conquest. A more outlandish rumor claims that the [[Observatory Skywatch|observatory]] at [[Skywatch]] has detected an incoming [[Celestial body|object]] which could cause another [[Earthfall]], and because of this, House Rogarvia fled to avoid the disaster. A final rumor is that the Vanishing is a sign that Choral's return is imminent.
