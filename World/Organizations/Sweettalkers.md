> The **Sweettalkers** are an unusual ethnic and religious group from far to the east of [[Avistan]] who follow a little-understood monotheistic religion that imposes strict rules. In the [[Inner Sea region]], they are found almost exclusively in the inclusive [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]].



## Beliefs

> The Sweettalkers of Kaer Maga believe that speech is a gift from god, and to utter anything but the most perfect true name of their [[Deity|god]] is heresy, yet none so far encountered have felt that they are worthy of this honor. In order to not speak an impure word, they sew their lips shut and communicate with each other in a code of clicks, whistles and sighs.


## Appearance

> Sweettalkers generally have light brown skin and thick black hair that they wear in a topknot. Their most distinctive feature, however, is the fact that they sew their lips almost all the way shut.


## Sweettalkers on Golarion

> Sweettalkers in the Inner Sea region have so far only been encountered in the Varisian city of Kaer Maga. They emigrated there generations ago, and now live in close-knit family groups in the city's [[Oriat]] district, particularly in the Street of Sighs.
