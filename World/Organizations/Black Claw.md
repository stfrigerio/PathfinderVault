> The **Black Claw** (sometimes **Black Claws**, **Black Claw Kobolds** or **Black Claw kobolds**) are a large clan of [[Kobold|kobolds]] inhabiting the [[Candlestone Caverns]], located in the [[Aspodell Mountains]] of northeastern [[Andoran]]. They are the dominant kobold tribe in the Caverns, having numerous smaller tribes who pay them fealty, in an almost feudal system.



## Description

> The tribe's name comes from the destructive practice of the [[Warrior|warriors]] coating their claws in [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spider]] [[Venom|venom]] during times of war and as a coming-of-age ritual, which eventually turns them black. This makes them more deadly, but also leads to their eventual death through prolonged exposure to the [[Poison|poison]], which is difficult to wash off. The kobolds themselves are generally either red- or black-scaled, and are said to be able to control local [[Vermin|giant vermin]].


## Trap-making

> The members of this tribe are ingenious trap-makers, and the local [[Human|human]] population has learned to quickly avoid areas where they can be found. The Black Claw are also the creators of a series of one-way tunnels which help to protect the kobolds from the predation of dangerous [[Darklands]] predators. These routes funnel the dark abominations from below the Caverns, past the Black Claw territory, and release them onto the surface world, much to the surprise of the local [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]] and [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]].


## Leadership

> [[Vexatox|King Vexatox]] is the current ruler of the Black Claws. His cousin, [[Zalsus|Captain Zalsus]] spends his time in [[Vault Candlestone Caverns|the Vault]], sparring with warriors, composing reports to the king, organizing transfers of [[Slavery|slaves]], and occasionally joining patrols in their rounds through the Vault. King Vexatox and his family are developing into a feudal ruler class of sorts, and believe that have pure [[Dragon|dragon]] blood in them, and the blessing of their draconic forebears. They also claim to be allied with [[Drow|drow]] forces through their connections to the Darklands.
