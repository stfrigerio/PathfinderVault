> **House Indros** is one of the founding families of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city-state of [[Magnimar]], but has declined in recent years to the point where it is no longer counted among the leaders of the city. The members are all descended of the original founder [[Alcaydian Indros]], and many of them still make their home in the manor house on the grounds of [[Fort Indros]].
