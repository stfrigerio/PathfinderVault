> The **Council of Vision** acts as the [[Steward Heaven|steward]] of [[Iudica]], the sixth level of [[Heaven]]. It is tasked with the monumental task of overseeing the government and administration of all of Heaven itself. Its three members are known as the Head, the Heart, and the Hand, which respectively embody knowledge and wisdom, love and salvation, and righteous military action. Even though it is no secret which [[Archon|archon]] currently holds each position, each is only referred to by his or her title when acting in an official capacity.
