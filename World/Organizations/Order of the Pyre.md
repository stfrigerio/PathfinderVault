 An Order of the Pyre Hellknight.
> The [[Hellknights]] **Order of the Pyre** was organized in [[Kuthona]] of [[4609 AR]] by [[Aligois Thels|Lictor Aligois Thels]].  This Order seeks out fanatical and blasphemous [[Witch|witches]], warlocks, cultists, [[Shaman|shamans]], mystics and madmen throughout [[Avistan]] and purges them with flame and steel.  While not one of the original Hellknight Orders, the Order of the Pyre's fanatical devotion to hunting cultists hearkens back to the original traditions of the Hellknights.



## Philosophy & methods

> Whether unhealthy beliefs take root in the minds of religious fanatics, practitioners of strange mystical arts, or students of radical philosophies, the Order of the Pyre strives to stamp out all outlandish convictions. This [[Philosophy|philosophy]] has given these Hellknights a well-earned reputation as cultist hunters who are intolerant of religion. Yet the Order of the Pyre also seeks to thwart philosophical revolutions and the insidious spread of dangerous ways of thinking. The order uses the faiths and mores of Chelish society as the standard of acceptable beliefs. The [[Inner Sea region|Inner Sea regions]] most common [[Deity|deities]] are acceptable to them, as are orderly philosophies such as [[Diabolism|diabolism]] and the [[Prophecies of Kalistrade]]. However, the order views whatever does not mesh with Chelish thinking or does not have an existing role within society as dangerous.


## Headquarters

> The Pyre has few holdings in [[Cheliax]] besides [[Citadel Krane]], whose walls are stained black from the ashes of countless burnt witches and heretical books.  Members of this Order travel in small groups, staying close to hotspots of religious fanaticism.


## Leadership

> Lictor Rouen Stought, a strict [[Atheism|atheist]], holds special hatred and fear for the [[Vudran pantheon|pantheons]] of the [[Vudrani]], and the Order has been working to purge immigrants from those distant shores of their heretical beliefs.


## Members

> Hellknights from this Order often come from families with deeply religious backgrounds, or those who have lived through the ravages of cults and madmen.
