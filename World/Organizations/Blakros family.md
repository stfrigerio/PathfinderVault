> The **Blakros family** are the owners of the [[Blakros Museum]] in [[Absalom]]'s [[Wise Quarter]]. The family made its money by selling goods, relics, and possibly secrets over the border between [[Taldor]] and [[Qadira]] during the early years of the [[Grand Campaign]].


## Marriage

> Since their rise to prominence, Blakros women have married a variety of nobles from various lands including Qadiran pashas, [[Vudra|Vudran]] rajahs, and more than one [[Mwangi]] tribal chief. These marriages allowed them to amass a large collection of genuine relics to begin the museum. Blakros women are renowned for their beauty and fertility, and marrying a Blakros woman is a sure path to wealth and power. The Blakros family demands a considerable dowry from suitors for the privilege of marrying one of their daughters.
