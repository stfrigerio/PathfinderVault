> All 63 members of the Council of Liberated Slaves are former [[Slaves|slaves]] and children of slaves. Five are elected to the [[Council of Sun and Sky]], a 100-seat council of city representatives that advises the Ruby Prince in day-to-day rulership, to represent the nation's [[Slavery|enslaved]] population. Former slave [[Dahnakrist Phi]] serves as the Council of Sun and Sky's First Leader.


## History

> Slave uprisings in Osirion, inspired by [[Andoran|Andoren]] independence in [[4669 AR]], demanded reforms to the nation's practice of slavery. Khemet III responded by enacting the Laws of Equitable Use in [[4679 AR]], which relaxed many of its policies around slavery and chartered the Council of Liberated Slaves.


## Functions

> In addition to electing members to the Council of Sun and Sky, the Council of Liberated Slaves also extends support to expeditions that employ slaves. One such expedition is [[Khymrasa|Exemplar Khymrasas]] excavation of [[Ahn'Selota|AhnSelota]].
