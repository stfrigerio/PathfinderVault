> The **Korvosan Guard** serves the city of [[Korvosa]] first, the city's leader second and the church of [[Abadar]] third. It maintains order in the city but turns into military operation whenever the city is threatened by external forces. The Guard is supported by the church of Abadar and works closely with both the [[Order of the Nail]] and the [[Sable Company]]. It remains tied to the [[Cheliax|Chelaxian]] traditions. [[Cressida Kroft|Field Marshal Cressida Kroft]] leads the nearly 700 soldiers of the Korvosan Guard.
