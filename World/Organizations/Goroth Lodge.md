> **Goroth Lodge** was the name of an ancient order of [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] who lived in the [[Verduran Forest]] around the beginning of the [[Age of Enthronement]]. Founded by the renegade druid [[Ghorus]], they were defeated by [[Taldor|Taldors]] [[First Army of Exploration]] under [[Porthmos person|General Porthmos]] in [[37 AR]]. Ghorus later fled to the nation of [[Nex]] where he created a new form of sentient plant-life known as [[Ghoran|ghorans]].
