> In the dense woods of the southern [[Fangwood]], a region known as the [[Chernasardo]], [[Molthune|Molthuni]] armies constantly seek to regain territory from the freedom-loving forest-dwellers of [[Nirmathas]]. **Chernasardo Rangers** are elite snipers, trappers, and scouts, using hit-and-run tactics. Working in teams of six or fewer, they are both stealthy and prudent enough to ambush large contingents of Molthuni soldiers and escape without ever being spotted. Each Chernasardo Ranger is usually equipped with a number of specialty arrows allowing them to be both unpredictable and deadly.


## Goal

> The Chernasardo Rangers fight for their personal freedom and revere the forest that provides their food and shelter. They are a nuisance both to Molthune's conquerors and Nirmathas's hopes for unification.


## Relationships

> The Rangers have recently allied themselves with the [[Fey|fey-queen]] [[Gendowyn]] of the Fangwood's [[Accressiel Court]], helping her deal with the continued threat of what remains of the [[Darkblight]]. The rangers are also allies of the [[Knights of Lastwall]] in their efforts to reclaim the [[Gravelands]], although they can do little more than provide support and hold the line against the [[Undead|undead]] horrors to the nation's north.
