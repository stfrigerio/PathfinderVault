> **House Oberigo** is one of the most powerful noble families in [[Cheliax]] and closely associated with the ruling [[House Thrune]]. They are led by [[Eirtein Oberigo]], the current patriarch, and are served by two minor noble families: the [[House Aulamaxa|Aulamaxas]] and the Ghivals. The walled estate of Vira Oberigo in the former capital of [[Westcrown]] has been the family's primary holding since the Four Families Siege, and they control nearly everything on the Wiscrani island of Siraon.
