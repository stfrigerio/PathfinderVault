> The **Windspire tribe** of [[Strix|strix]] inhabit the [[Devil's Perch|Devils Perch]] province of western [[Cheliax]], concentrated largely on their namesake roost of [[Windspire]]. They also claim [[Crackspike]] as a summer roost and the waters of [[Tokarai Springs]] in a truce forged through bloody victories against the Chelish.
