> **House Garess** is based in the western part of [[Brevoy]], in the foothills of the [[Golushkin Mountains]]. It is led by Lord [[Howlan Garess]], who is a widower. His adoptive heir is [[Toval Golka]], a [[Dwarf|dwarf]] and son of the clan-chief of the [[Golka]] dwarves' holding. Howlan's own son disappeared in the [[Vanishing]] along with all the [[Golka]] dwarves, deep inside dwarven hold of [[Golushkin]] within the Golushkin Mountains.
> House Garess' crest is that of a snow-capped mountain peak in gray set against a dark blue field. There is a silvery crescent [[Moon|moon]] in the upper right corner, and there is a black hammer across the base of the peak. The Houses' motto is "Strong as the Mountains."
> House Garess had a good relationship with the Golka dwarves until the dwarves vanished. Members of the house worked the metal that the dwarves mined.
> The House has built several strongholds, [[Highdelve]] and [[Grayhaven]], in the Golushkin Mountains.
