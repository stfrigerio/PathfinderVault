> The **Puddlejumpers** are a [[Halfling|halfling]] knife gang made up entirely of freed [[Slavery|slaves]], personally liberated by the local [[Vudrani]] slaver [[Pardu Pildapush]]. They work for Pildapush out of the [[Absalom]] neighborhood of the [[Coins]], and are quite loyal to him, both because he freed them and because he pays them well.
