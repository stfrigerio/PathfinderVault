> [[Magnimar|Magnimars]] **Sewer Goblins** are a collection of various [[Goblin|goblin]] families that call the [[Magnimar's sewers|sewers of Magnimar]] home. These goblins rarely form tribes or other larger groupings, preferring instead to congregate in bands of a dozen or so extended family members.
> These goblins have a knack for getting into places even skilled thieves would find difficult to crack, granting them unwitting access to numerous powerful magical items and [[Alchemical items|alchemical supplies]].


## History

> In the past, the goblins of Magnimar's sewers competed for space and resources with a population of [[Mite|mites]], small [[Fey|fey]] who had made their way up from the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Nar-Voth]]. The sewer goblins eventually won this contest and drove the blue-skinned creatures to migrate to other areas, such as the pilings of the [[Irespan]].
