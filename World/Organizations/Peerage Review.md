> The **Peerage Review** is a group of councilors who advise the [[Monarchy Korvosa|monarch]] of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city-state of [[Korvosa]]. They are composed of the heads of Korvosa's five Great Houses, but have little power to affect policy. An amendment of the [[Korvosa City Charter]] allows a unanimous vote by the Peerage Review to countermand any order given by the monarch to the [[Korvosan Guard]], but this power has never been used. Mostly, the monarch allows him or herself to be advised by the Peerage Review with little conflict.
