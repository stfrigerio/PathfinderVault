> The **Ouat** of [[Osirion]] are an isolated caste of [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[Monk|monks]] based in the mountain valley near [[Tar Kuata]]. They are led by [[Menkha Helg]].



## Appearance

> The Ouat have shaved heads that represent their distance from traditional dwarven culture, and have deeply tanned skin. Most are [[Pahmet]] dwarves.
> They are contemplative and forgo elaborate attire. They favour simple pleated linen skirts and bare chests.


## History

> [[Logyra]], an ancient dwarven princess of [[Jormurdun]], and her retinue fled after an invasion around [[1600 AR]] to [[Garund]] and joined the Pahmet in Osirion. They then joined the monastic Ouat in Tar Kuata, where Logyra influenced their [[Philosophy|philosophical]] break from ancient dwarven traditions and inspired them to focus inwardly toward self-perfection.


## Philosophy

> The Ouat espouse a [[Philosophy|philosophy]] of worshiping a [[Divine|divine]] spark that they believe exists in each living creature. Like followers of [[Irori]] and [[Nethys]], they pursue perfection through self-improvement; they shun the [[Dwarven pantheon|dwarven pantheon]] and claim that those [[Deities|deities]] are incapable of leading individual dwarves or their kind toward a form of cosmic perfection.


## Society

> Pahmet who practice among the Ouat are scholars of the [[Fighting style|martial arts]] taught in the monastery. Their combat techniques are an unarmed version of the Pahmet's [[Sphinx|sphinx]]-inspired mastery of [[Hammer|hammers]]. Many Ouat serve [[Osirion|Osirian]] mages as bodyguards.
> The Ouat live and congregate in the Pahmet Heights of Tar Kuata, a set of caves and strip of the valley that the monks call home.
