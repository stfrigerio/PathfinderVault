> The **Cult of Dahak** was established by the great [[Dragon|dragon]]-priest [[Aashaq]] when she came to the islands now called [[Dahak's Teeth|Dahaks Teeth]] in the [[Shackles]]. She chose the island of [[Dahak's Horn|Dahaks Horn]] for the loyal [[Humanoid|humanoid]] worshipers to inhabit. The cultists are characterized for their appetite for mayhem similar to that of their [[Dahak|cruel lord]], but they managed to establish the thriving settlement of [[Dragonsthrall]] on the island.
