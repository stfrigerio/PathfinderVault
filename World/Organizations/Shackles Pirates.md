*See also: [[Shackles pirate]]*
> The **Shackles Pirates** are a loose collection of thieves, smugglers, extortionists, sailors, freedom-fighters, and other n'er-do-wells based in the archipelago of the [[Shackles]] off the western coast of [[Garund]], south of the [[Eye of Abendego]]. Once a collection of independent pirate lords, they joined together as a single fleet in [[4674 AR]] under the [[Hurricane King]] to prey on the shipping channels to the north.



## History

> More recently, the nation of [[Nidal]] has been allowing vessels of the Shackles Pirates to dock in [[Nisroch]]; by so doing they have managed to simultaneously annoy both [[Cheliax]] and [[Andoran]], which is no mean feat. The Nidalese are buying slaves from the pirates, which they then transport through the [[Shadow Caverns]] and sell to denizens of the [[Darklands]].


## Organization

> They have no true headquarters, operating instead out of the numerous coves and settlements of the Shackles. In theory, anyone is welcome to join the organisationâ€”including the crews of captured [[Ship|ships]]. They value their freedom above all else, and as a result are very loosely organised. Individual crews serve a [[Free Captains|Free Captain]], most Free Captains band together in the service of a pirate lord, and the lords serve on the [[Pirate Council]] under the leadership of [[Kerdak Bonefist]], the current [[Hurricane King]].


## Operations

> The Shackles Pirates attack shipping in the region of the [[Eye of Abendego]], relying on local knowledge and superior seamanship to outsail enemy warshipsâ€”typically those of [[Cheliax]] and [[Rahadoum]]â€” but raid as far north as the [[Arch of Aroden]]. They used to raid the shipping of [[Sargava]], but no longer do so; instead they receive a hefty tribute from the former colony in return for protecting it from Cheliax.

## Squadrons

> - [[Devils' Own|Devils Own]]
> - Jolis Raffles' fleet of seven galleys, five sloops, and two frigates based in [[Bag Island]]

## Vessels

> Shackles pirates prefer ships that balance size with range and capacity, though a definition any more precise than that is open to fervent debate. The recent arrival of Free Captain Satekai's Tian-made *Red Fortune*, which exemplifies this balance, has set up a growing demand for similar Tian ships among other Shackles pirates.

> - *[[Blood Moon]]*, a brig
> - *[[Chains of Freedom]]*, a galleon
> - *[[Filthy Lucre]]*, a man-o'-war bearing cannons from [[Alkenstar]]
> - *[[Darkbow]]*, a ketch operating out of [[Beachcomber]]
