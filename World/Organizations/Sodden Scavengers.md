> The emergence of the [[Eye of Abendego]] destroyed the nations of [[Lirgen]] and [[Yamasa]], replacing them with the modern day [[Sodden Lands]]. 
> The disaster attracted an organised group of [[Norgorber]]-worshipping looters into the region. The ambitions of the leading members caused the group to split into nearly two dozen gangs, who have no wish to return to a criminal existence in more civilised lands.
> Each gang tries to promote its individual identity, but they are collectively known as the **Sodden Scavengers**. The gangs seek to expand their own territory at the expense of the other gangs, but they unite in the face of an external threat. Currently, the strongest gang is the grandiosely self-titled [[Knights of Abendego]]. Sometimes, the Sodden Scavengers turn to piracy.
