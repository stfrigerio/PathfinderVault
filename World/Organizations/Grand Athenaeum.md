## History

## Staff

These include [[Julistar|Paracount Julistar]], a Thrune loyalist, avid [[Osirionologist]], and leader of [[Her Majestrix's Expeditionary|Her Majestrixs Expeditionary]]. It also includes [[Marianix Karn]], who recently lead an expedition to explore ruins from the [[Jistka Imperium]] in the [[Archduchy of Hellcoast]].


## Holdings

> The Athenaeum's libraries are home to works collected during the [[Everwar]]. Its holdings include the original text of Osirionologist [[Imivus]] *Aucturn Lexicon* kept under lock and key, and it is the site of his tomb.


## Expeditions

> The Athenaeum sponsors or leads expeditions across many of Cheliax's territories, with a particular interest in the Jistka Imperium.
