> The **Bearpelt following** is currently the largest tribal [[Following|following]] in the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] and is led by the immensely powerful [[Kuldor|Mighty Kuldor]], who takes the title "Herdsman". It includes several thousand individuals and makes its winter home southeast of the settlement of [[Icestair]]. This location lets it profit handsomely from trade from [[Tian Xia]] over the [[Crown of the World]]. Being leader of the most powerful tribe, Mighty Kuldor has nearly a dozen [[Giant|giants]] in his thrall. Gurrak serves as the Bearpelt bloodspeaker giving instruction to members of the tribe including the children.
