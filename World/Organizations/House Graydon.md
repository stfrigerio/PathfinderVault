> The **Graydon** family (motto: *Guardians of the Dawn*) are known for producing [[Knight|knights]] that are excellent soldiers and engineers. The family is also noted for its unbending loyalty to [[Ustalav]]'s ruling family. Their heraldry is of a sun-silhouetted howling [[Wolf|wolf]].
> The family owns many lands including the town of [[Sturnidae]] in the county of [[Barstoi]] where a member of the family takes the title of Margrave of Sturnidae. The present Margrave, [[Cilas Graydon]], is currently in exile in [[Lozeri]]; the Margrave was convicted of treason by [[Aericnein Neska|Count Neska of Barstoi]] in the latter stages of the [[War Without Rivals]] for denouncing Neska as a tyrant.
