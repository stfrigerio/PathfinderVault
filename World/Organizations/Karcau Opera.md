> The **Karcau Opera** is based in the large city of [[Karcau]]: the county capital of [[Sinaria]], in [[Ustalav]]. It is more than an [[Opera|opera]] house or company, being a large arts complex in the north of the city hosting many arts organizations (see *[[Structure]]*). It is considered among the pre-eminent schools for the arts in all [[Avistan]], renowned for elegance and tradition. The Karcau Opera has produced some of the top artistes of the musical world over the years, though few alumni tend to stay in the city once their courses have finished.



## Notable members and associates

> The headmistress of the Karcau Opera is [[Calmadra Vhalikackos]]. She has an on-off relationship with the talented conductor [[Aldentor Rudono]] of the [[Palace of Voices]] in [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]].
> The current ruler of Sinaria, the [[Sasandra Livgrace|Countess Sasandra Livgrace]] occasionally performs at the Karcau Opera and is very popular. The countess boarded at the opera As a teenager, but in [[4692 AR]] she tried to run away and was kidnapped. She was found some three months later in the city's sewers.
