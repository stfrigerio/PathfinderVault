> The **Butterfly Blades** are an order of yellow-robed killers that follow a tradition that dates all the way back to [[Yixing]]. They are renowned for their mastery of the butterfly sword and their training results in them becoming whirlwinds of death with their chosen [[Weapon|weapon]]; they are also able to use it to inflict painful wounds instead. The Butterfly Blades originate from [[Goka]] and have long been affiliated with the noble Nai family, currently headed by [[Nai Yan Fei|Lady Nai Yan Fei]], the Empress of Goka. They work from the shadows, eliminating her enemies and helping to keep the scheming nobility in line. To become eligible for training with the Butterfly Blades, a would-be initiate must defeat a member of the Butterfly Blades in a sanctioned bout.
