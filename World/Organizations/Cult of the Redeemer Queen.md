> The **Cult of the Redeemer Queen** promotes the heretical idea that the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Nocticula]] has abandoned the [[Midnight Isles]] and is becoming a more [[Neutral alignment axis|neutrally-aligned]] [[Deity|deity]] of [[Art|artists]], midnight, and outcasts. While Nocticula's traditional worshipers have not lost access to their more [[Evil|evil]] [[Divine magic|divine magic]], [[Cleric|clerics]] among these heretics have also begun receiving [[Spell|spells]] from her sourced from different [[Domain|domains]]. Their [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]] is a seven-pointed crown behind a [[Moon|moon]] bearing lips, and they favor the [[Dagger|dagger]].
> Others view this cult's beliefs to be the result of a ruse on Nocticula's part. Although these skeptics agree that Nocticula seeks true [[God|godhood]], they believe that the demon lord seeks to become an assassin of gods and seeded rumors of her quest for redemption to hide her true intentions. Likewise, the cult has faced opposition and assassinations from more orthodox worshipers of Nocticula. Nocticula herself seems to enjoy the strife caused by these disagreements, and grants her heretical followers the same [[Magic|magic]] that she grants her traditional worshipers.
