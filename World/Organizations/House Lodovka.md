> **House Lodovka** is a noble family of [[Brevoy]] with their headquarters on [[Acuben Isle]] on the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]]. They have traditionally been a power on the lake. Led by Lord [[Kozek Lodovka]], both their fleet size and influence along the lake continue to increase. The fleet primarily catches fish and freshwater crabs.
> The house's crest includes a green crab climbing out of the water towards a gray tower/keep. Their motto is "The Waters, Our Fields".
