> **House Arkona** is one of the most powerful noble families in the former [[Cheliax|Chelish]] colony of [[Korvosa]]. Unlike most other families of that town, members of the Arkona family live only in [[Varisia]].


## History

> Although an old family that predates even the founding of [[Cheliax]], by [[4458 AR]] House Arkona had sunk into poverty. [[Garath Arkona|Lord Garath Arkona]] of [[Korvosa]] and his sociable brother and adviser Jenkson Arkona, in the [[Ship|caravel]] *[[Reprieve]]*, set sail for distant and exotic [[Vudra]]. The shipment they brought back returned House Arkona to a place of prominence in the nobility. Overnight, the much-derided house went from among the poorest noble families to second only to [[House Jeggare]] in wealth. In the next few years Lord Garath and Jenkson indulged in nearly every vice available, from [[Recreational drugs of Golarion|drugs]] to cruelty to pleasures of the flesh.


## Current prospects

> Since their initial voyage to Vudra, House Arkona has only increased its wealth and influence in the city. Nothing occurs in the back alleys or stinking vaults of [[Old Korvosa]] without House Arkona knowing about it. It is a poorly kept secret that the family controls or has influence over every major (and most minor) criminal enterprise in the city.
