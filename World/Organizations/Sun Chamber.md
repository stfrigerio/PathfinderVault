> The **Sun Chamber** is the governing body of the [[Bachuan|Republic of Bachuan]]. Founded by [[Grandfather Pei]] after the [[Bachuan Revolution]], the Sun Chamber formed the nerve center of the new [[Communism|communist]] government. Consisting of at least half a dozen ambitious councilors, the Sun Chamber oversees numerous ministries, most infamously the [[Ministry of Peace and Harmony]].
> Following Grandfather's death in [[4668 AR]], the Sun Chamber has been chaired by his younger widow, Pu Yae Men, better known as [[Grandmother Pei]].
