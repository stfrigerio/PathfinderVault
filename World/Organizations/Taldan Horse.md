> [[Taldor|Taldors]] cavalry is comprised of both [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]] and [[Elephant|elephant]] units, though it is collectively known as the **Taldan Horse**.



## Horse legions

> The horse legions break the lines of enemy advancement and outflank enemy units. They consist of heavily armed [[Knight|knights]] led by a knight-captain. The horses are raised in huge horse farms in southern Taldor.


## Elephant legions

> The elephant legions move supplies and, in some cases, crush the core of the enemy army. They are led by knights but consist mainly of regular soldiers. The elephants come from breeding stock brought from [[Garund]] thousands of years ago during one of the expeditions of the [[Army of Exploration|Armies of Exploration]].


## Deployment


### Imperial Palace, Oppara

> The Taldan Horse, alongside their colleagues in the [[Taldan Phalanx]], have the duty of guarding the [[Imperial Palace]] in the [[Imperial Square]] district of Oppara. Daily marches across the Imperial Square are held and the regiments, particularly, guard all palace entrances.
