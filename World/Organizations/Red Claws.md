> [[Redtooth]]'s city watch is known as the **Red Claws**. Redtooth is the capital of the western [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] province, called [[Verge|The Verge]]. Captain of the Red Claws is the [[Winter wolf|winter wolf]] [[Rogosh Vix]], although he usually remains in his [[Human|human]] form. The Red Claws' barracks are located in the wooden towers which encircle the town. The citizens of Redtooth pay protection money to the Red Claws, called "gate tax", in order to keep the gates of the houses closed at dusk, when the winter wolves prowl the dark streets.
