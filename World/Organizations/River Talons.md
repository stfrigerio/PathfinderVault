> **The River Talons** are a gang of violent [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]] thugs that are one of the patchwork of small gangs, including the [[Red Jills]], and Gray Spiders, that make up [[Kintargo|Kintargos]] criminal underworld. The River Talons most commonly haunt [[Bleakbridge]], the only bridge that crosses the [[Yolubilis River]] linking the two halves of Kintargo. The River Talons are mostly opportunistic cut-purses and greedy thugs who dream of being something more. Under their leader, [[Ravzee]], they aspire to become Kintargo's one true thieves' guild but are too riven with petty infighting and discord for this to ever be anything more than deluded fantasy.
