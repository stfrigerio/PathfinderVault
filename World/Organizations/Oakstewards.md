> The **Oakstewards** is a [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druidic]] organization that rules the [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Sevenarches]]. Their leadership is sometimes detached but also strong. The druids seem unmoved by cries of [[Human|human]] injustice, but act quickly to protect the land and the people. The Oakstewards operate in secrecy and no one knows how many Oakstewards exist. Four roles among the druids are shown in public:

> - The **Voice of the Wind** serves as the speaker to outsiders, and the foreign affairs diplomat
> - The **Root of the Sapling** encourages growth of crops and children
> - The **Bloom of the Harvest** ensures food distribution to the people of the region and the foreign buyers
> - The **Sharp of the Bark** defend the borders, waters and roads of the land.
> The Oakstewards meet and confer in a secret lodge in the [[The Elderwoods|Elderwoods]]. Their lodge resembles a great hall made by the branches of huge ancient oak trees.
