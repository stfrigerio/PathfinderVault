> **Balanced scales of Abadar** are devoted servants of the God of wealth and trade.
A unique part of the priesthood that exists to deal with the important demands that [[Katapesh]] has put on the church of [[Abadar]].



## Role

> As well as performing all the usual functions of a priest of [[Abadar]], the balanced scales venture into the depths of Katapesh's wilderness seeking to reclaim ill gotten or lost wealth from the tombs and ancient ruins that dot the wilderness. More than mere tomb robbers or divinely sponsored [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]], balanced scales seek to return this wealth to its rightful owner or, if that proves impossible, then use it for the betterment of all civilization and thus strengthen [[Abadar]]'s church.


## Becoming a balanced scale

> To become a balanced scale requires more than devotion to [[Abadar]], a prospective member must also be an experienced divine spellcaster with both an eye for value and training at the art of bypassing locks and traps.
