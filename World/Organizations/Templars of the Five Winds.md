> The **Templars of the Five Winds** are a band of heroes, led by the [[Djinni|djinni]] [[Nefeshti]], who adventured to the area now known as [[Katapesh]] in [[2216 AR]]. They achieved their goal of freeing enslaved djinn from the [[Genie binder|genie binder]] Kinroth. The group was encountered periodically over the following centuries, but is reputed to have disbanded shortly after defeating the [[Efreeti|efreeti]] [[Jhavhul]] in [[4300 AR]].
