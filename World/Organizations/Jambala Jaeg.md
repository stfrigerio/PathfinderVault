> The now-extinct **Jambala Jaeg** tribe of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] (part of the [[Zenj]] subgroup of the [[Mwangi human ethnicity|Mwangi]] people) were known for their vehement opposition to the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Angazhan]] and were wiped out as a result of this conflict. As part of their efforts to rid the jungle of Angazhan's influence, they crafted ritual knives with bone handles and obsidian blades designed to kill the [[Demon|demonic]] spirits within the monkey idols known as [[Tik Taan]].
> A thousand years ago, [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of the Jambala Jaeg created the magical grove known today as [[Ranage's Circle|Ranages Circle]].
