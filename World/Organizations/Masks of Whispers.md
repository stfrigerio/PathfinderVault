> The **Masks of Whispers** are part of a larger group of organisations, known as the [[Masks of Vyre]], that serve the various [[Kings and Queens of Vyre]]. The Masks of Whispers serve [[Simandu|Queen of Whispers Simandu]] who is a rare [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Spider|spider]] shapeshifter called a [[Bestiary/Jorogumo|jorogumo]]. The Masks of Whispers serve the city of [[Vyre]] controlling the flow of information through the city and protecting the reputations of its most prominent citizens. Unbeknownst to most of Vyre's citizens the Masks of Whispers have been secretly usurped by the Church of [[Norgorber]] and so they also serve the cult indirectly, alongside the [[Masks of Keys]].
