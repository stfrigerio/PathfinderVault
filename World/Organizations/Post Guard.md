> The **Post Guard** is the District Guard of the [[Eastgate]] district of the city of [[Absalom]]. The [[Postern|Postern Gate]] serves as the headquarters of the guard. The guards train harder than even the [[First Guard]]. In times of war they are officially assigned only to guard the Postern but have a history of volunteering for suicidal missions to save the city. Each guard is given three months off-duty each year and most of them use it to train themselves or serve as guards to caravans or explorers' expeditions to the [[Isle of Kortos]]' interior. [[Ayunga of House Akkesh]] is the captain of the Post Guard as well as the [[Nomarch|nomarch]] of the Eastgate Council.
