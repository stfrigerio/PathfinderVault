> The **Darahan** family (motto: *We Are the Wall*) has been influential in [[Taldor]] since the [[Shining Crusade]]. Known for generations of [[Knight|knights]], these cousins of the extinct Adella family are known as monster-hunters. Their family crest is a hammer and mattock surrounding a medusa head. Darahan knights create an intimidating presence by wearing great helms displaying the family insignia.
