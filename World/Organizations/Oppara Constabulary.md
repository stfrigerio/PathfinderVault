> The **Oppara Constabulary** keeps the capital city of [[Taldor]] safe, by patrolling most of [[Oppara|Opparas]] streets day and night and using a number of stations throughout the city. It is especially tough towards the unbearded. The headquarters of Oppara's Constabulary are located in the [[White Hall]] in [[Grandbridge]] district. The constables are trained in the Lion Academy and Crown Circle schools. Oppara's Constabulary was unable to stop the crime waves in [[Westport]] at night, and for this reason the special force of [[Porthmos Militia]] was established there by Harbormaster [[Hallador]].
