*This article covers the militant sect of [[Calistria|Calistrians]]. For their temple in [[Kyonin]], see [[Imvrildara]].*
> The ancient [[Calistria|Calistrian]] order of the **Imvrildarai**, located in the southern [[Fierani Forest]] of [[Kyonin]], is the [[Deity|goddesss]] most militant sect of worshipers. These followers of the Savored Sting have defended the forest against [[Treerazer]] and its [[Demon|demonic]] armies for thousands of years.



## History

> The Imvrildarai's history dates back nearly 10 millennia, to the temple [[Imvrildara|Imvrildaras]] completion in [[-5570 AR]] near what was at the time the center of Kyonin's larger borders. The order and temple are named for a Calistrian priest who authored and illustrated a record of the Savored Sting's role in the battle against [[Rovagug]].
> The Imvrildarai's modern reputation as a sect of demon hunters, however, began in [[2497 AR]] when Imvrildara took in refugees from Treerazer's destructive rampage. Among those refugees was the farmer [[Alendeil]], who became a priest of Calistria, then later single-handedly defended the temple against Treerazer's [[Nalfeshnee|nalfeshnee]] [[Echataxun]] through a miraculous act of Calistria that sealed the demon in stone.
> Nearly two centuries later in [[2632 AR]], the Imvrildarai led [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Elf|elves]] returning from [[Castrovel]] against Treerazer with such success that the order relented and retreated to academic pursuits.


## Leadership

> The most recent High Priestess of Imvrildara is [[Delerenai Ashwalker]], who succeeds the archivist [[Rekaereil Sandurei]]. Sandurei was killed and his body captured by [[Cambion|cambions]] in [[4714 AR]].


## Members

> The temple's worshipers are divided into two groups exemplifying Calistria's values of revenge and deceit. Its Scions of Revenge is led by the ambitious [[Keshmarada]], while its Scions of Deceit is led by [[Almeredei Songbreaker]], a friend and ally of Sandurei. Each house occupies one of the temple's two standing towers, appropriately named the Tower of Revenge and the Tower of Deceit.
> A third group, the Scions of Lust, left the temple after a [[Retriever|retriever]] of the [[Glabrezu|glabrezu]] [[Mokravud]] destroyed the temple's Tower of Lust in [[3732 AR]].
> The temple's membership includes many types of Calistrians, including [[Alchemist|alchemists]], [[Bard's End|bards]], [[Cleric|clerics]], and [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Antipaladin|antipaladins]]. Outsiders are largely judged by the opinion of them held by High Priestess Ashwalker.


## Imvrildara

***Main article: [[Imvrildara]]***
> While showing its thousands of years of age through overgrowth and use, Imvrildara's persistence is also a testament of its durability. Trees spring through its stone floors near and between its three outer towersâ€”the towers of Revenge and Deceit, which extend four floors skyward, and the ruined Tower of Lust. The fourth and largest central structure, of which only a single domed floor extends above ground, descends into three sub-basements.
