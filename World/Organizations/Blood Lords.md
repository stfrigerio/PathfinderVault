*For another meaning of "Blood Lords", please see [[Blood Lords adventure path]].*
> Until recently, the [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghostly]] [[Necromancer|necromancer]] [[Geb (person)|Geb]], nominal ruler of his [[Geb's Rest|self-titled nation]], rarely chose to manifest, leaving his [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] Queen [[Arazni]] to act as head of state. Even with his re-emergence in [[4719 AR]] as the nation's rightful ruler, the day-to-day administration of the kingdom continues to be carried out by the **Blood Lords**. Most, but not all, are powerful [[Necromancer|necromancers]] and are headquartered at the [[Ebon Mausoleum]] in [[Mechitar]], and have pledged loyalty to Geb till deathâ€”and beyond, as many of them are [[Undead|undead]] already. The leader of the Blood Lords is the [[Vampire|vampire lord]], [[Kemnebi|Chancellor Kemnebi]]. 



## Members

> There are about 60 Blood Lords, and they include [[Vampire|vampires]] (usually [[Moroi|moroi]]), [[Wraith|wraiths]], [[Mummy|mummies]], shades, and liches. They look down on the nation's lesser undead nobles.
> Specific members include:

> - Mirgona Zede
> - Hyrune Loxenna
> - Quarnim Ix
> - [[Berline Haldoli]]
> - Kyril Vonth

### Favored familiars

> Most Blood Lords demand longevity from their [[Familiar|familiars]], relying on undead, [[Construct|constructs]], and [[Outsider|outsiders]]. Those who prefer [[Animal|animal]] familiars usually select a creature with a deathly connotation, such as [[Raven|ravens]] and vultures.


## Duties

> Ostensibly, the Blood Lords are a unified council tasked with almost all matters of state aside from the nation's secret police (who report directly to [[Geb (person)|Geb]] himself). They are lawmakers, creating and adjudicating the laws that govern both the living and the dead in Geb. They act as judges, resolving disputes between [[Mortality|mortals]] and the more intelligent undead. They handle military matters and they promote the nation's well-being by maintaining its numerous magical wards and looking after its interests abroad, in addition to acting as diplomats and signing treaties with other countries.
