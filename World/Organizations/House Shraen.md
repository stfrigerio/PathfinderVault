> **House Shraen** was once one of the great [[Drow|drow]] houses of [[Sekamina]]. Rather than following the other houses and adopting [[Demon|demons]] as their patrons, they worshipped [[Urgathoa]] and studied the mysteries of [[Undead|undeath]], and were ultimately exiled.


## History

> Even the drow could not tolerate their vile practices, and House Shraen was forced into exile down into [[Orv]]. In [[820 AR]], they arrived at the [[Black Desert]] after a harrowing journey of many thousands of miles. Only the undead members of the House had survived up to this point, and they settled in a vast abandoned city they named [[Shraen]].


## Inhabitants

> Today, all of the members of House Shraen are powerful undead spellcasters: [[Vampire|vampires]], [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|liches]] and worse creatures. None is affected by the harmful [[Radiation|radiation]] of the Black Desert. They raid the [[Ghoul|ghouls]] of [[Sekamina]] for undead [[Slavery|slaves]], or capture living creatures to turn into undead. They have also managed to magically control the [[Purple worm|purple worms]] that live in the Black Desert. They travel across the sands in the gullets of their worms, seeking out secrets hidden by the desert.
> Notable members of House Shraen include:

> - Dyzallin Shraen
> - [[Larielle Shraen]]
> - [[Nyrinda Shraen]]
