> **House Henderthane** is one of the most powerful noble families in [[Cheliax]]. They made their money a milennia ago as weapons dealers, and still supply [[House Thrune]] and its allies with all the magical and mundane weapons they require. The patriarch of the family until [[4709 AR]] was [[Einmarch Henderthane]], who was killed as part of a decades-long conspiracy by the [[Devil|devil]] [[Orxines]]. In the aftermath of the Henderthane affair, all of Einmarch's immediate family were sentenced to death by the Crown.
