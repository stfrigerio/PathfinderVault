> The **Children of Wadjet** are a nativist [[Garundi human ethnicity]] organization, active in [[Osirion]]. They helped [[Harun of Abadar]], the future [[Khemet I]], seize power in Osirion in [[4608 AR]]. Their name is likely a reference to the [[Deity|deity]], [[Wadjet]], a personification of the spirits guiding and guarding the ruler of Osirion.
