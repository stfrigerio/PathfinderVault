> The **Shades of the Uskwood** is a cabal of [[httpenwikipediaorgalbinism|albino]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] who call the dark heart of the [[Uskwood]] of [[Nidal|Nidaltheir]] home.  While the Shades are dedicated to the natural power of the dark wood, they also revere [[Zon-Kuthon]]. This reverence is symbolized by the wearing of an Umbrae-Token, a fetish of hair, twigs and blood. For this worship, these dark druids are rewarded with the ability to cast [[Spell|spells]] beyond the abilities of their uncorrupted brethren. They are led by [[Eloiander of Ridwan]], who is also a member of the [[Umbral Court]], the council that rules that dark nation.
