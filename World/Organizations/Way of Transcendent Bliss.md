> **The Way of Transcendent Bliss** is a new faith brought to the small [[Irrisen|Irriseni]] town [[Belila]] by a charismatic woman named [[Minesqa Rovoyosh]] in [[4711 AR]]. Today more than half the town has converted to the new religion, the [[Frederyka Elvanna|baroness]] and [[Boalloc|baron]] included. What none have yet realized is that the Way of Transcendent Bliss is a [[Demon|demonic]] cult of the Sacred Whore [[Sifkesh]]. Minesqa holds her ecstatic rituals in a converted chapel of [[Pharasma]] after Pharasma's priest committed suicide upon realizing the blasphemy he had embraced.
