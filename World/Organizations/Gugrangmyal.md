> The **Gugrangmyal**, or **Children of the Cold Hell** as they are also known, are a tribe of [[Fiendish|fiendish]] [[Xulgath|troglodytes]] that dwell within the depths of the [[Labyrinth of the Two Hells]] in [[Zi Ha]]. The Children of the Cold Hell war constantly with their rivals, the [[Gutshadmyal]] or "Children of the Hot Hell". The Children of the Cold Hell were created many, many lifetimes ago by the [[Samsaran|samsaran]] [[Wizard|wizard]] [[Bakju]]. Bakju found the ruins of an ancient xulgath civilizations that predated the current troglodytes' fall into barbarism and became obsessed with the idea of trying to force enlightenment upon them. This previous incarnation of Bakju decided upon splitting each troglodyte's spiritual essence into two halves; the hot ki persona that embodied their passions and emotion and the cold ki persona that embodied rationality and intellect. Bakju believed that in doing this he would force the troglodytes into resolving the differences between these fundamental aspects of themselves which would force enlightenment and understanding upon the brutish creatures. Bakju's plan backfired spectacularly. Instead of reaching spiritual enlightenment, each troglodyte became dominated by one half of their personality and replaced the missing portion with raw fiendish energy. Those dominated by their intelligent, rational side became the Gugrangmyal or Children of the Cold Hell.
