> The Black Echelon was a covert cell of [[Taldor|Taldan]] agents in the early 40th Century [[AR]] who were tasked with infiltrating the defenses of [[Absalom]] in preparation for the [[Silent Tide]].  Their mission was to weaken the city's defenses and alert systems, paving the way for the larger naval invasion.  Their plan was uncovered and the leaders of the group, who were to signal the rest of the cell into action, were assassinated.  The remaining members of the Black Echelon were put to the sword after the Absalom navy dispatched the Taldan fleet to the last mast.
> Each member of the cell had taken an ancient oath, known as the Binding Word, prior to deployment, which guaranteed their service to the mission despite any obstacle, including death.  In [[4708 AR|4708]], eight centuries after taking the oath, the Black Echelon were raised as silent, misty undead creatures called [[Black Echelon operative|Black Echelon operatives]] to carry out their original mission.
