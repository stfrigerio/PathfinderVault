> The **Stroud Sisters** are a coven of [[Green hag|green hags]] who live in the [[Ditches]] in the [[River Kingdoms]]. They are three triplets from an [[Ogre|ogre]] father, named Demelza (the matriarch), Elspeth, and Mairghread. They were stillborn but somehow recovered, and the near-death experience has given them power over the [[Undead|undead]].
> They seek to breed with any available males and have no compunctions about incest. As a result, they now have a brood of over a dozen [[Ogrekin|ogrekin]]. They also have a [[Marsh giant|marsh giant]] minion they call Brother Grunt.
> The sisters prey on travellers and marsh dwellers, and take a particular delight in tormenting the exiled nobles of nearby [[Gralton]].
