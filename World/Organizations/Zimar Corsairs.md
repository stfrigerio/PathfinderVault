> The **Zimar Corsairs** are [[Pirate|pirates]] of the [[Jalrune River]] pressed into service as [[Privateer|privateers]] by the [[Taldan Imperial Navy]] to patrol the river and the southeastern [[Inner Sea region]] and sink [[Qadira|Qadiran]] merchant vessels. The privateers also [[Slavery|enslave]] merchant [[Ship|ships]] to add both ship and crew to their numbers. Their home base lies in [[Zimar]]. The corsairs are a quasi-legal part of the Imperial Navy, which finances their operations. Each captain of a corsair galley gets a [[Letter of Mark]] that both identifies them as a full captain of the navy and grants them some legal protections in the case they fall into enemy hands.
