> The [[Knight|knights]] of the **Order of the Green Feather** were the holy warriors of the [[Peacock Spirit]], and served the [[Runelords|runelords]] faithfully as specially trained militia used against enemies of the empire. The [[Castle of the Green Feather]] was the sacred flying fortress of the knights, capable of transporting legions of knights across great distances. The castle crash-landed after the [[Earthfall]] on a mountaintop northwest of [[Xin-Cyrusian]]. It is said that some of the knights were turned into [[Graveknight|graveknights]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|liches]] upon death and today they continue to guard their sacred castle and serve the Peacock Spirit.
