> The **Cailean Council** was an historical [[Revolutionary Council]] that ruled [[Galt]] for a short period. Led by the chairman, [[Durgan Rane]], the council believed that absolute change was the only path to prosperity. To achieve this goal, it changed the alphabet of the [[Common]] language and the names for the days of the week. Chairman Rane also instituted martial law and mandatory conscription, but was ironically ousted in a *putsch* by his own, newly trained soldiers.
