> **Althameri** is the collective name for several matrilineal nomadic tribes who founded the [[Empire of Kelesh]], and from whom Kelesh's nobility are descended. While most Althameri tribes have settled into cities over the centuries, the [[Al-Zabriti]] of [[Qadira]] proudly retain their ancient nomadic traditions while looking with some disdain on urban Althameri as having abandoned their roots.
