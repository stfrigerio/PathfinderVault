> **House Dioso** is an aristocratic [[Cheliax|Chelish]] family headquartered in the old capital of [[Westcrown]]. Of old [[Chelaxian]] stock, they inhabit the Vaneo Dioso, the most opulent building on Triam, one of the city's islands. They took over the mansion after eliminating its builders and original inhabitants, House Krafanis. A powerful Wiscrani family, the Diosos have two other minor, beholden noble families under their wing, the [[House Jhaltero|Jhalteros]] and the Ucalaars. Within the strict social and political hierarchy of the 12 major Chelish noble families, the Diosos rank in the middle between [[House Julistarc]] and [[House Tilernos]]. The matriarch (or patriarch, the gender is unclear) of the Diosos also sits on the secret [[Council of Thieves]].
