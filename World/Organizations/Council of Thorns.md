> The **Council of Thorns** was an ancient [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druidic]] circle, the members of which faced the unstoppable [[Orc|orc]] horde in the [[Hold of Belkzen]] in [[4237 AR]]. The druids martyred themselves to protect what is now the [[Ghostlight Marsh]].



## History

> The druids opposed the devastation the orcs were wreaking on the land and aided the forces of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] until the [[Sunwall]] finally fell to the invading horde. They were gradually forced back to the swamp between the [[Flood Road]] and the [[River Esk]], and their final act was to sacrifice themselves in a bloody [[Ritual|ritual]]. As their blood mingled with the swamp water, dozens of lights rose from the murky swamp. Those lights were the Council of Thorns reincarnated as [[Will-o'-wisp|will-o-wisps]] who have guarded the Ghostlight Marsh ever since, although rumor has it they do not attack those well attuned to nature. The will-o'-wisps retained memories from their former lives as druids.


## Survivors

> A common rumor says that a mute [[Elf|elven]] druid known as [[Silvermane]] in the small town of [[Trunau]] is the only survivor of the Council of Thorns. He has resided on the hill protecting the vital [[Hopespring]] since before Trunau was founded there.


## Vault of Thorns

***Main article: Vault of Thorns***
> To help fight orc invaders, the Council created a [[Demiplane|demiplane]] called the Vault of Thorns. Its entrance is within the Ghostlight Swamp and can be found by placing the husk of a dead will-o'-wisp inside a *ghostlight lantern*.
