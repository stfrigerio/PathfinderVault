> The **Cullertons** were one of the three merchant families which formed the small [[Lambreth|River Kingdom of Lambreth]]. The Cullerton family was the oldest of the three families. They founded the town of [[Maashinelle]] in the lowlands where the Tolemaida River joins the [[West Sellen River]] in [[4355 AR]]. Fearing annexation from their neighbors, the three families negotiated a union, ruling the region as the [[Triunes of Lambreth]], in [[4502 AR]]. The union was proposed by [[Leeoda Cullerton]].
> When Lambreth was threatened by imminent invasion from neighbouring [[Razmiran]] in [[4675 AR]], the Triunes, in desperation, offered the lordship of the realm to [[Kamdyn Arnefax]] if he could defeat the invaders. When Arnefax returned victorious from the battle against the Razmiri invaders and demanded the lordship of Lambreth, the [[Angelidis family]] as well as [[Vizcarra family]] swore fealty at once, while [[Tandre Cullerton|Master Tandre Cullerton]], who resisted, was killed immediately, and the Cullertons were dispossessed and exiled under penalty of death.
> Lord Arnefax now rules Lambreth from the former Cullerton Manor in Maashinelle.
