> Members of the ancient and esteemed [[Cheliax|Chelish]] noble **House Leroung** have long served their country and its colonies as teachers and scholars. The lords or ladies of the house rarely bother with the dirty politics of court life. To this day, the house maintains extensive libraries in the three largest cities of Cheliax, and family members control both the [[University of Egorian]] in Cheliax and [[Almas University]] in [[Andoran]]. [[Eliasia Leroung|Lady Eliasia Leroung]] is the current headmistress of the [[University of Korvosa]] and is considered an ally by most other noble houses.
> The widespread practice of using [[Halfling|halfling]] crews on trading [[Ship|ships]] was started by House Leroung in an effort to maximize profits. Nearly half of all the ships belonging to [[Korvosa|Korvosas]] elite are halfling-sized and -crewed ships built by House Leroung.
> [[Dess Leroung]] was the Lord Magistrate of Korvosa who imported the [[Otyugh|otyughs]] from Cheliax as a partial solution to the issue of waste on isolated [[Endrin Isle|Endrin Island]].
> [[Jessa Leroung]] founded the University of Korvosa in [[4488 AR]].
> Skara Leroung was Lord Magistrate of Korvosa in [[4606 AR]] when the weekly shipments from Cheliax stopped arriving due to the confusion accompanying the death of [[Aroden]].
> The wizard [[Sheel Leroung]] was a political ally of [[Daidian Ruel]] and aided his research into deviltry and organization in the [[Outer Sphere]]. In [[4599 AR]], he was given permission to take 20 [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]] into the western edge of the [[Menador Mountains]] on a private venture. In return for this, he provided funds to create a new Hellknight fortress there, which became [[Citadel Enferac]].
