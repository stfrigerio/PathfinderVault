> The **Skittering Ravager tribe** of [[Orc|orcs]] was nearly destroyed when their chief and a sizable portion of their greatest warriors died as a result of the release of [[Necromancy|necromantic]] energy in the hidden fortress of [[Skull Hill]] in the southern [[Hold of Belkzen]]. They have since reformed under the new leadership of [[Mukuhn the Reborn]], who, like the other survivors of the accident, has been changed by the magical exposure.
