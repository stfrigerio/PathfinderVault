> **House Orlovsky** controls northeastern [[Brevoy]] from [[Eagle's Watch|Eagles Watch]] on [[Mount Veshka]]. They try to rise above petty political maneuvers. As staunch allies of the now disappeared [[House Rogarvia]], this has landed them in a prickly situation.  If Lord [[Poul Orlovsky]] chooses to rebel against [[Noleski Surtova]], they could potentially align with [[House Garess]] and [[House Medvyed]]. These three houses could disrupt supply and travel routes between [[House Surtova]]'s two power bases, [[Port Ice]] and [[New Stetven]].


## Heraldry

> The house crest is a black eagle with wings spread in front of a gold field. Their motto is "High Above."


## People

> - Lord [[Poul Orlovsky]]
> - [[Sylvanna Orlovsky]]
