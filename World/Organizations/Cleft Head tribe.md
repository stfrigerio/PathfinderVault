> The **Cleft Head** is an [[Orc|orc]] tribe that dwells in the [[Hold of Belkzen]], near the [[Human|pinkskin]] settlement of [[Freedom Town]]. Renowned by other orcs as cowards, they are often said to be the "last to battle, first to flee." The tribe has historically been led by a succession of chiefs, the latest being [[K'zaard the Drover|Kzaard the Drover]]. The unruly orcs need to be constantly well-stocked with spoils (especially alcohol) to keep them from rebelling.
