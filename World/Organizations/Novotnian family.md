> The **Novotnian family** is a family that lives in the nation of [[Andoran]], in the region known as [[Darkmoon Vale]], which their ancestors settled in the early 42nd century [[AR]]. The Novotnians are most known for their advanced [[Falcon|falconry]] techniques; knowledge of the family's methods are passed from teacher to student, though an illustrated guide to the Novotnian techniques are said to be housed in the [[University of Egorian]], in the nation of [[Cheliax]].



## History

> The family traces its roots in Darkmoon Vale back to [[Karas Novotnian|Karas the Falcon Novotnian]], who arrived to the Vale in [[4113 AR]]. With assistance from the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] military, Karas and several friends established [[Adamas|a fort]] in the Darkmoon Vale wilderness and began to take control of the region from the native [[Kellid]] tribes in the name of the Empire of Cheliax. In [[4117 AR]], Karas was awarded the title of Baron of Darkmoon by the Emperor of Cheliax for his efforts to bring Darkmoon Vale into the empire; this title survived for nearly six centuries.
> Other members of the Novotnian family also played pivotal roles in Darkmoon Vale, and subsequently in Andoran at large. [[Barenddo Novotnian]], nephew of Karas, founded the logging town of [[Olfden]] in [[4128 AR]], whose inefficiencies inspired Tarris Rakesclaw â€” a grandson of Karas's business partner Rene Rakesclaw â€” to buy out the operation in [[4139 AR]] and reform it, leading to the nascent [[Lumber Consortium]] that would eventually dominate parts of Andoren life.


## Relationships

> The Vendikon family and [[House Fordyce]] were neighbors of the Novotnians and their holdings in Darkmoon Vale.


## Heraldry and naming

> People referred to Karas and his descendants as the "Falcon" because of the [[Falcon|falcon]] on the crest of Baron Novotnian's [[Heraldry|heraldic display]], a heater [[Shield|shield]] of red and blue alternating squares dominated by the profile of an argent falcon in flight with prominent talons. This was the true origin of the "falcon" in so many names in Andoran. Even with the death of the last Falcon-Baron Novotnian and the eradication of nobility in Andoran, the people continue to embrace the imagery and iconography of the [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Bird|bird]].
