> The **Heralds of Summer's Return** is an underground, anti-government movement of idealists and freedom fighters in [[Irrisen]]. Its ultimate goals are to overthrow the witch queens and to break the spell that holds Irrisen in eternal winter.



## History

> The organization was born after the tragic end of the [[Hoarwood Rebellion]] in [[3445 AR]]. The first act of the movement was made during the [[Hoarwood]] dedication ceremony hosted by the duchess Osilla Morgannan in [[3449 AR]]. It was a suicidal attack that failed, but in which the duchess Osilla lost one eye. As a result, Duchess of Hoarwood ordered that every peasant in the province, even the children, would suffer the same. The movement itself did not die. It carries on to this day, organizing in loosely affiliated cells to limit the damage caused by infiltration, and engaging in sabotage. The Heralds preserve the Ulfen people's hope that someday the [[White Witches]] will be defeated.


## Members

> Most of the members of the Heralds are [[Ulfen]], descendants of the original inhabitants of the land before Baba Yaga's invasion. A fair number of [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] also belong to this group, motivated to return climatic balance to the nation.
