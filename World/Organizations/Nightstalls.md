> The **Nightstalls** are [[Katapesh city|Katapeshs]] most infamous marketplace. The customers openly buy and sell not only information, [[Recreational drugs of Golarion|drugs]], [[Poison|poisons]], and smuggled relics, but also more exotic and vile wares like [[Disease|diseases]], [[Devil|diabolic]] contracts, [[Curse|cursed]] and corrupt [[Magic|magic]], and rare [[Magic|magical]] components. It is said that even [[Soul|souls]] can be bought and sold in the Nightstalls. The Duskwalker Guild, led by the [[Osirion|Osirian]] [[Tiefling|tiefling]] [[Khafira Blacktongue]], takes care of the smooth operation of the market. Most of Katapesh's [[Slavery|slave]] and drug trade passes through the Nightstalls, as do untaxed merchandise. Nearly a third of the people associated with the Nightstalls are slaves.
