> The **Gray Gardeners** are the hooded executioners of [[Galt|Galtan]] justice, and are violent, mob-ruled, and rarely just. During the ever-changing [[Red Revolution]] that has soaked Galt in blood for over 40 years, the Gray Gardeners have remained a constant. They have seen revolutionary leaders rise, and then separated their heads from their bodies scant months later. The Gray Gardeners are the guardians and maintainers of the *[[Nethys/Artifacts/Final Blade|final blades]]*, the guillotines which are the most feared symbols of Galtan justice.
> The reason they have remained a constant in Galt is their anonymity: all members of the Gray Gardeners wear gray [[Silk|silk]] veils to protect their identities. Several different [[Revolutionary Council|Revolutionary Councils]] have demanded that they reveal themselves, but the Gray Gardeners realize that anonymity is their best protection from the bloody justice of mob rule. They are based in the city of [[Litran]], where the presence of their imposing monastery actually serves as a stabilizing presence, keeping away the roaming mobs that plague the rest of Galt. Despite this stability, Litran is not a welcoming place, as the Gray Gardeners are not friendly towards outsiders.

> Though wildly popular with the Galtan mob, Gray Gardeners are rightly feared by certain members of the populace for their abilities in tracking and interrogation.
