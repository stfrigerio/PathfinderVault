> The **Gray Maidens** were the all-female, elite bodyguard for [[Ileosa Arabasti|Queen Ileosa Arabasti]] of [[Korvosa]]. Since the queen's death, the group has been officially disbanded. A few cells, however, remain active in [[Varisia]] (outside of Korvosa) and in [[Cheliax]].



## History

![[Crimson_Throne_battle.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 The Gray Maidens protect their queen.
> The Gray Maidens were founded in [[4708 AR]] by Queen Ileosa in the chaos following her ascension, in order to secure a military force that was loyal only to her. Members of all the other military or militia units in and around Korvosa (including the [[Sable Company|Sable Company marines]], the [[Order of the Nail]], and the [[Korvosan Guard]]) were under the command of individuals whose loyalty to the new queen was questionable.
> During the queen's brief reign, the Gray Maidens enforced her will with increasingly violent methods. After the [[Blood veil|blood veil]] plague was quelled, Queen Ileosa named the order as the new protectors of Korvosa, appointed [[Sabina Merrin]] as its leader and the new General of Korvosa, and granted the organisation even more power and prestige. She also dissolved the Sable Company and merged its remnants into the Guard, leading to a failed assassination attempt by its commandant [[Marcus Endrin]] and a subsequent riot that the Gray Maidens brutally put down.


### After Queen Ileosa's death

> The queen's death within the same year resulted in the shattering of the organisation into small, often rival, factions. Smaller bands include Faceless Kaid's Band and the Maidens of the Lady's Light, although none has been as successful as the Erinyes Company and the [[Scarlet Rose]].


## Recruitment and training

> Initially, new recruits were selected from the most beautiful female warriors in Korvosa, particularly those from the Sable Company, the Order of the Nail and the Korvosan Guard, although later recruits were often criminals taken from the city's more violent underworld. Conscripts had to pass the queen's examination for strength and beauty, and those who failed were ultimately disfigured and imprisoned in the castle dungeon. A gruelling initiation process awaited those who succeeded designed to break down their personalities, to leave their faces scarred, and to teach them unquestioned loyalty to the queen. The psychological conditioning was typically augmented with [[Magic|magical]] [[Compulsion|compulsions]], and many former members suffered from the after-effects of this trauma.


## Equipment

> As royal guards, Gray Maidens were outfitted with fine [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] and a distinctive (and intimidating) helm with red plumes. In combat, most Gray Maidens used a more refined version of the [[Hellknights]] [[Fighting style|fighting style]], a style that has proven surprisingly popular with many young warriors.
