> The **Merry Widows** are a sect of priestesses of the pirate-goddess [[Besmara]]. They have established a temple in the wreck of *[[The Merry Widow]]*, a [[Ship|vessel]] scuttled off the coast of [[Slitherfish Island]] north east of [[Mediogalti]], and also live on board the ship.
> The members are all women who have lost their husbands at sea. They believe that their menfolk were accepted by Besmara as sacrifices, and consider themselves blessed as a result.
> Some Mediogalti women are believed to donate unwanted males to the Merry Widows as sacrifices to Besmara.
