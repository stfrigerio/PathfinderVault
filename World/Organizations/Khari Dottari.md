## History

> Khari is a former [[Rahadoum|Rahadoumi]] city, and it still contains rebels who wish to return the city to Rahadoumi rule, particularly among the native [[Garundi human ethnicity|Garundi]] gentry. The dottari, sometimes with the aid of the [[Order of the Rack]], actively arrests, tortures, and kills such dissenters and rebels.
