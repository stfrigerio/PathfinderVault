> **Clan Zilleran** is a clan of [[Azer|azers]] who escaped from the [[City of Brass]] and settled near an underground vein of lava beneath [[Jernashall]]. The clan is led by their cleric [[Noble Zilleran]]. Their settlement is in the area of the ancient [[Magma dragon|magma dragon]] [[Moschabbatt]]'s lair. The azers forge objects of exotic beauty which Moschabbatt trades with other [[Darklands]] denizens. Two hidden passages allow access to small platforms above the lava lake from where the azers could assist the dragon against invaders.
