> The **Ombo** are a tribe of [[MwangiBonuwat|Bonuwat]] who are now based mainly in [[Senghor]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].
> At one time they were merchants, but their business was fatally disrupted by the [[Eye of Abendego]]. Since then, they have switched to [[Pirate|piracy]] and [[Slave|slave]] trading. They have an understanding with the pirates of the [[Shackles]], and have taken to dressing in similar fashion, favouring baggy pantaloons.
> Their piracy is mainly carried out against their fellow Bonuwat, particularly the peaceful [[Ijo]] fisherfolk of [[Desperation Bay]].
> They limit their slave taking to native [[Mwangi]], many of whom they buy from the [[Bandu]].
> It is said that they also have dealings with the [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] of [[Desperation Bay]]. Rumours say that they have helped the sahuagin establish a base in the Bay, and that they trade slaves to them.
