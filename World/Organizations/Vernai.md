> The **Vernai**, also known as the **High Killers**, are the ruling council of the [[Red Mantis]] [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|assassins]], second in authority only to Blood Mistress [[Jakalyn]] herself. They live in the [[Odalis]] section of the [[Crimson Citadel]] on [[Mediogalti]].
> Members of the Vernai are almost invariably female, although there is no absolute prohibition against male members. Although they address each other by name, they keep their identities a secret to any outside of their circleâ€”to non-Vernai they are known only by their titles. Tradition has it that there are 13 members of the Vernai, but that number can vary. In the past, their numbers have dropped as low as seven and gone as high as 23. Estimates suggest that about a third of the Vernai are [[Slayer|slayers]].
> The Vernai are not merely assassins. The Red Mantis are a religious organisation, so the Vernai are also responsible for interpreting and acting upon the will of [[Achaekek]], and the Blood Mistress is considered the authority of his will.
> Heretics of Achaekek who disregard the Red Mantis assassins' religious role are considered to be enemies of the faith by the Vernai.
