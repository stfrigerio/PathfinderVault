> **House Drovenge** is an old, respected [[Cheliax|Chelish]] noble family that has weathered the death of [[Aroden]] and rise of [[House Thrune]] without substantial loss of prestige or position. The house is wealthy and conservative, and the family patriarch, [[Vassindio Drovenge|Vassindio]], is a key player in the [[Council of Thieves]]. Along with [[House Oberigo]], it is one of the two most powerful [[Noble houses of Cheliax|noble houses]] of Cheliax (under the ruling House Thrune, of course). Even though it is a Chelish noble family, the majority of its members are of [[Taldan]] heritage.
