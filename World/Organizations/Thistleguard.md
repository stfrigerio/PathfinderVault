> **The Thistleguard** is the Ivy District watch led by captain Zharep Apul. With tourism being one of the most profitable sources of income, the watch often turns a blind eye to minor crimes, especially when they are committed by foreigners. Instead, the guard spends its time enforcing strict regulations that forbid performances by artists who arenâ€™t members in the Street Performers and Actorsâ€™ Guild; itâ€™s no coincidence that the guildâ€™s leader, [[Alain Always]], is also the council [[Nomarch|nomarch]] and the reason behind captain Zharep Apul's deep depression and negligence of his duties.
> The guard's lackluster performance causes the Thistleguard to have little respect among the locals, and most prefer to turn to the [[Brotherhood of Abadar]] when given the chance.
