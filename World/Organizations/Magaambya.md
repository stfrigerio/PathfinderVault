*See also: [[Magaambyan arcanist]]*
> The **Magaambya** is [[Golarion|Golarions]] oldest academy of [[Magic|arcane learning]], even if many proud schools in [[Avistan]] have never heard of it. It was established by the most devoted pupils of [[Jatembe|Old-Mage Jatembe]] and his [[PathfinderWiki/Ten Magic Warriors]] in [[Nantambu]] in [[-2832 AR]], and is still in operation thousands of years later. The Magaambya's feared flying Tempest-Sun mages ensure that both cultists of [[Angazhan]] and raiders of the [[Aspis Consortium]] give the town a wide berth. The adjective used for all things associated with the Magaambya is **Magaambyan**.



## Geography

> The Magaambya stands at the centre of Nantambu, a colorful agricultural town on the [[Vanji River]] in the western [[Mwangi Expanse]]. It consists of numerous buildings within a ring of ten terraced towers. Each tower is decorated with a mosaic image of one of the nameless Ten Magic Warriors.


## Academics

> Much of its teaching and records are oral. The school owns a few written documents, but many of those were taken away by masters and are now scattered throughout villages which might be hundreds of miles away from Nantambu.
> The current head of the school is High Sun-Mage [[Oyamba]].


### Arcanists

> [[Wizard|Wizards]] and [[Arcanist|arcanists]] cooperate extensively at the Magaambya to preserve Old-Man Jatembe's legacy. Some of the [[Zenj]] arcanists claim that three of the Ten Magic Warriors were arcanists as well, although most dispute this assertion.


### Ekujae

> The [[Ekujae]] elves live locally to the Magaambya and, as they possess the intelligence and magical aptitude of elves in general, many are found at the school as students or teachers.


### Favored familiars

> The academy's arcanists have close ties with nature and prefer [[Animal|animal]] and [[Fey|fey]] [[Familiar|familiars]]. This includes elusive creatures like [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bats]] and [[Weasel|weasels]], [[CategoryMwangi fauna|Mwangi fauna]] such as [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Monkey|monkeys]] and [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaurs]], and fey [[Sprite|sprites]] and brownies.
