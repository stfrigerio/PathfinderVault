> The **Ironbell** tribe of [[Eloko]] is one of the tribes that inhabit the eastern [[Mwangi Expanse]] town of [[Elokolobha]], located on the boundary of the [[Screaming Jungle]]. The tribe is famous for its use of small [[Iron|iron]] bells, which its members ring to lure prey to their deaths. [[Ngabo|Ngabo the Deathbringer]] is the tribe's chieftain. 
> The Ironbells populate a cluster of spires in the central part of Elokolobha, named Ngabo-Bara. Dozens of dizzying rope bridges lead to cliff settlements along the steep outer crags to the south.
