> The **Kitharodian Academy** (or the **Kith**, as it is called by the citizens) is one of the largest [[Bard's End|bardic]] colleges on [[Golarion]]. The Kith allows anyone to attend its performances: members of the royalty class, the senatorial class, or unbearded. Even [[Stavian III|Grand Prince Stavian III]] himself sometimes attends its performances. The acting and [[Music|music]] training at Kith is tough, producing high-level professionals. Students are expected to follow the rules and the graduation path is established by their department advisor.
> The Kitharodian Academy is located in [[Oppara|Opparas]] [[Canal Row]] district, astride of the northern cliffs of the city, overlooking the [[Porthmos River|Mighty Porthmos]]. Its great campus features beautiful gardens, large squares, fountains, and exquisitely constructed buildings topped by high towers. More than 2,000 students are enrolled at any given time and nearly 200 teachers, administrative staff, and other employees work in the Kith.
> The Kitharodian Academy's administrator is [[Merriweather Stokes|Lord Merriweather Stokes]]. Besides his administration duties, he leads casts of [[Taldor|Taldors]] greatest living actors in some of the best theatrical performances of the [[Inner Sea region]].
> The secret behind the Kith is that it is a front for Taldor's secret core of spies, called the [[Lion Blades]]. The organization usually selects its recruits among the best of the trained bards, as it prefers creative thinkers and intelligent problem solvers. Nearly all of the teachers are veteran Lion Blades, including Lord Merriweather Stokes.
