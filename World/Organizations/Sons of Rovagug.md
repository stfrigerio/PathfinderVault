> **The Sons of Rovagug** are a clan of particularly large [[Ogrekin|ogrekin]] gladiators with a fierce reputation. They are named in honor of the god [[Rovagug]] and fight in the infamous [[Flesh Pens]] of [[Urglin]] in eastern [[Varisia]]. Despite their name, all seven members of the Sons of Rovagug are actually female ogrekin who have mutilated their bodies in such a way as to be unrecognizable as such. They are a feared team of gladiators even by the standards of the brutal Flesh Pens of Urglin, gleefully murdering all who face them.
