> **House Jarvis** are one of the nine noble houses of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Kintargo]] that make up the prominent [[Court of Coin]]. House Jarvis are known to be more loyal to the city of Kintargo itself than to the Chelish Crown or [[House Thrune]]. House Jarvis' interests are in architecture, building, and trades related to it, including carpentry and stonemasonry. Members of House Jarvis are often known to have a particularly sharp eye for concealed architectural features like hidden doors. The district of [[Jarvis End]] was named in honour of House Jarvis due to its work in raising it, and also the districts of [[Old Kintargo]] and [[Redroof]] above the seasonal flood plain of the [[Yolubilis River]] in the early days of Kintargo.
