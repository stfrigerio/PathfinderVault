> The **Brothers of the Seal** are a monastic order in [[Kaer Maga]]. For generations, they were sworn to defend an ancient doorway far beneath the [[Art|artists]]' district of [[Oriat]]. Recently, however, a schism has arisen between those who believe that the time has come to open the seal and those who still cling to its traditional defense. The result is a violent sectarian war between the Faithful and the Scions.
