> **House Caliphvaso** is one of the most prominent noble families of the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] capital of [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]]. House Caliphvaso was one of two surviving noble families located and restored shortly after the refounding of the Immortal Principality of Ustalav (in the wake of the [[Shining Crusade]] and the defeat of [[Tar-Baphon|the Whispering Tyrant]]). It was [[Sesasgia Caliphvaso]] of House Caliphvaso who refounded the city of Caliphas in [[3836 AR]], only two years after the rebirth of the new nation. The rivalry between House Caliphvaso and House Odranti seems to have begun very shortly after this and only helped exacerbate the rivalry between the Houses' home cities of Caliphas and [[Ardis]].
> House Caliphvaso has two main residences that could be considered the home of the House: the [[Lethean Manor]] serves as their residence within the city of Caliphas, while [[Chateau Douleurs]] serves as their sprawling manor home outside the city.

> House Caliphvaso's current leader is [[Carmilla Caliphvaso|Countess Carmilla Caliphvaso]], a very politically active noblewoman. She has something of a fell reputation; beautiful, charming, and intense, she is also rumoured to possess a fierce temper, is an arch-manipulator, and has few moral compunctions. Her detractors also whisper of occult secrets, for Carmilla seems not to have aged in decades, and rumours speak of a crimson lightning that has struck down those who oppose her.
