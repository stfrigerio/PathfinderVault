> The **Bloody Barbers** is the name of the largest thieves' guild operating in the city of [[Absalom]]. The group does not operate in the [[Ascendant Court]] district, where thieves are better off having their activities approved by the [[Cleric|clerics]] at the [[Black Mask]].
> Controlling a significant portion of Absalom's money lending and fencing activities, the Barbers eliminate their enemies by cutting throatsâ€”an activity they call a "crimson shave". Bloody Barbers often employ a special [[War razor|war razor]], termed a *final word*, for performing crimson shaves.
