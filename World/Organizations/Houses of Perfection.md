> The greatest of [[Jalmeray|Jalmerays]] many monastic orders are known collectively as the **Houses of Perfection** or, sometimes, as the **Schools of Perfection**. They are known throughout the [[Inner Sea region]] for their teaching of the spiritual and mental arts from the [[Vudra|distant East]], especially when applied to fighting. They are called the [[Monastery of Untwisting Iron]], the [[Monastery of Unfolding Wind]] and the [[Monastery of Unblinking Flame]]. In [[4718 AR]], a fourth House of Perfection, the [[Monastery of Unbreaking Waves]], re-emerged from centuries of desolation after being destroyed by a tsunami.

> All are welcome to attempt a series of seemingly impossible challenges in order to gain acceptance as a student of one of the Housesâ€”race a [[Djinni|djinni]], wrestle a [[Shaitan|shaitan]], and outwit an [[Efreeti|efreeti]]â€”and many come from all over the Inner Sea region and from [[Vudra]] to learn. Those who fail the challenges might still be accepted for training by one of the lesser monastic orders. Once every ten years the Houses compete with each other in the [[Challenge of Sky and Heaven]]. As of [[4708 AR]], the Monastery of Untwisting Iron has won the last two Challenges.
> The three Houses of Perfection are located on the eastern road out of [[Niswan]].
