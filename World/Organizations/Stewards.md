> The **Stewards** are an elite coalition of soldiers and diplomats tasked with preventing the Ring of Nations of [[Verces]] from descending into war.



## Goal

> The Stewards' primary goal is to defend the Ring of Nations, ensuring that all member states remain loyal. If necessary, they also serve as a secondary police force, or defend against invading monsters from the Fullbright or Darkside.


## Structure

> Members of the Stewards are recruited from all three [[Vercite]] castes. They only answer to the Grand Assembly, the parliamentary body that governs the Ring of Nations as a whole.


## Sites

> Every nation in the Ring of Nations has at least one Steward citadel, all of which are connected by [[Teleportation|teleportation]] stones, allowing the Stewards to easily mobilise from one citadel to any other across Verces.
