> The **Deeptreasure Mining Company** is based in [[Sargava]]. They are known for supplying the largest and most beautiful of the [[Gem|gemstones]] sold in the markets of [[Anthusis|Eleder]].
> These gems are obtained from the [[Mines of Deeptreasure]], a secret location in the [[Bandu Hills]]. The company has been exploiting [[Xorn|xorns]] in order to obtain the [[Jewel|jewels]].
> In [[4381 AR]], the company began operating in the Bandu Hills, competing with the [[Dwarven|dwarven]] and [[Gnomish|gnomish]] mining operations. In [[4426 AR]], the competition between Bandu Hills' miners turned to open fighting and the company barely survived. Their offices in [[Kalabuto]] were burned down and their officers presumed dead. In [[44' AR]], the company resurfaced deeper in the Bandu Hills and quickly overcame its rivals. Between [[4428 AR]] and [[4431 AR]], the company abandoned its headquarters and continued its operations from a series of secret bases scattered throughout the Bandu Hills.
