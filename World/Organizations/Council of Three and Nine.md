> The **Council of Three and Nine** is the ruling body of the nation of [[Nex]].
> Until [[576 AR]], the land of [[Nex]] was ruled by the mighty archmage [[Nex (person)|Nex]], who was able to balance the country's various scheming political factions. The archmage disappeared in that year, and the factions began to fight each other. The formation of the Council of Three and Nine was an attempt to bring the factions back into (relative) harmony as the infighting could not be allowed to continueâ€”especially since the country was fighting for survival against the neighbouring nation of [[Geb's Rest]]. 
> The council meets in the [[Bandeshar]] in [[Quantium]], once the palace of Nex himself.


## The Three

> The council is currently dominated by the Three rather than the Nine. An agreement between any two of the Three is sufficient to veto any proposal agreed on by the Nine. In contrast to the Nine, the composition of the Three has not changed for over 100 years.

> - [[Agrellus Kisk]], leader of the [[Arclords of Nex]]
> - [[Iranez]] of the Orb, a powerful [[Witch|witch]]
> - Elder Architect [[Oblosk]], castellan of the [[Bandeshar]]

## The Nine

> There is considerable competition for places among the Nine, and thus membership varies. The current composition is:

> - Master [[Alchemist|alchemist]] [[Borume]], representative of the city of [[Oenopion]]
> - Fleshforger [[Dunn Palovar]], representative of the city of [[Ecanus]]
> - Master [[Phade]], believed by many to be the leader of Quantium's [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|assassins]]
> - [[Gen Hendrikan]], senior [[Cleric|cleric]] of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Abraxas]]
> - [[Elemion]], a mutated representative of the wasteland tribes
> - The high cleric of [[Nethys]]
> - The high cleric of [[Pharasma]]
> - A representative of the nation's [[Merchant's League|Merchants League]]
> - A politician serving one of the many other factions (changes constantly)
