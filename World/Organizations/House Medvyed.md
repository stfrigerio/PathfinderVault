> **House Medvyed** is a noble house of [[Brevoy]] that holds authority over the eastern lands that border and contain the [[Icerime Peaks]] and [[Gronzi Forest]]. They have maintained the traditions of worshiping nature, the "Old Way". Lord [[Gurev Medyed]] heads the [[Stoneclimb]]-based house.
> The people of the area raise mountain [[Goat|goats]] and [[Sheep|sheep]]. They hunt in the forest and farm what little good land is on the edges of their concerns. Religion in this area tends to be more centralized on [[Erastil]], but rumors of hidden shrines to [[Lamashtu]] do exist.
> The house crest is a black [[Bear|bear]] with black antlers above its head in front of a red field. Their motto is "Endurance Overcomes All."
