> The **Pirate Council** consists of the most powerful of the **pirate lords** of the [[Shackles]]. Each controls one of the major ports of the region. They are led by the [[Hurricane King]], who rules the Shackles with the support of the members.
> The current Hurricane King is [[Kerdak Bonefist]]. It is rumoured that his successor will be [[Tessa Fairwind]], but some speculate that the succession might be sooner rather than later.
> The winner of the annual [[Free Captain's Regatta|Free Captains Regatta]] is awarded a seat on the Council, but for the last five years this has been the [[Master of Gales]], so the composition of the council has not changed.
