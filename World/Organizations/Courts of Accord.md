> The **Courts of Accord** is located in a stately white building on [[Iudica]], the sixth level of [[Heaven]], where its leaders periodically convene to discuss important issues and patiently weigh ethical decisions. Such concepts would likely be regarded as impossible paradoxes to [[Mortal|mortals]]. It is the home of the [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lords]] [[Dammerich]], who resides in the southern wing of the Courts, and [[Olheon]], who occupies the northern wing. Their proximity to one another helps these two empyreal lords work closely together. Between them lies the Hall of Thrones, the meeting chambers of Heaven's most powerful beings. At the back of the Courts of Accord, the Red Rotunda is a reminder that Heaven's justice sometimes involves execution.
