> The **Vizcarra family** is one of the three merchant families which formed the small [[Lambreth|River Kingdom of Lambreth]]. In [[4424 AR]], the merchant [[Marstead Vizcarra]] overthrew the local lord in the area and founded the small town of [[Sezgin]]. The Vizcarra family has been ruling the town since then. Fearing annexation from their neighbors, the three merchant families of the area negotiated a union, ruling the region as the [[Triunes of Lambreth]], in [[4502 AR]]. When Lambreth was threatened by imminent invasion from neighbouring [[Razmiran]] in [[4675 AR]], the Triunes, in desperation, offered the lordship of the realm to [[Kamdyn Arnefax]] if he could defeat the invaders. When Arnefax returned victorious from the battle against the Razmiri invaders and demanded the lordship of Lambreth, the [[Angelidis family]] as well as Vizcarra family swore fealty at once, while [[Tandre Cullerton|Master Tandre Cullerton]], who resisted, was killed immediately, and the [[Cullerton family|Cullertons]] were dispossessed and exiled under penalty of death.
> [[Sanger Vizcarra]] is the elected mayor of Sezgin, travelling to [[Maashinelle]] only upon matters of importance.
