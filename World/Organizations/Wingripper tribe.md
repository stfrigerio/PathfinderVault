> The **Wingripper tribe** or clan is a small tribe of [[Orc|orcs]] living in and around the city of [[Wyvernsting]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. These orcs prowl the high peaks around the settlement, seeking young [[Wyvern|wyverns]] to tame. Despite the heavy losses involved in such a dangerous practise, the tribe is rightfully feared as a result.
