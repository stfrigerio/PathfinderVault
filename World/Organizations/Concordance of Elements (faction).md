*For another meaning of "Concordance of Elements (faction)", please see Concordance of Elements.*
> The **Concordance of Elements faction** (or just the Concordance for short) within the [[Pathfinder Society]] is an [[Extraplanar|extraplanar]] operation that seeks out [[Element|elemental]] imbalances, [[Planar breach|planar breaches]], and extraordinary natural phenomena to close breaches, re-establish natural order, and study the [[Multiverse|multiverse]] in all its splendour. To fail in this is to allow rampant growth to choke out all life, stand by as one plane's power snuffs out the life of another, or watch as the cosmos spins out of [[Alignment|alignment]].

## Background

![[Ashasar.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Ashasar]], Liaison to the Seat of Balance.
> The Concordance is an ancient and diverse organization whose membership spans multiple planes, with a particular focus on the [[Elemental Plane|elemental planes]]. Its members take great interest in the interplay among the primal forces of air, earth, fire, and water. They believe that the stability of the multiverse ultimately depends upon these forcesâ€”and many othersâ€”remaining in balance.
> Each member has her own ideas about how to maintain this equilibrium. Some of them set upon a perilous quest for understanding in places where elemental forces are at their strongest, from howling blizzards to ferocious thunderstorms to active [[Volcano|volcanoes]]. Others seek to refine the balance within, mastering [[Magic|magical]] forces or fighting styles that evoke multiple elements. Still others search for yawning planar rifts and other massive disturbances to study or seal away.
> As an organization, the Concordance believes that each individual member's personal journey of discovery is important. Its leaders, collectively known as the Cycle of Five, spend much of their time in meditation and reflection, leaving its agents free to act with relative autonomy. Of course, agents who contribute more to the Concordance's collective knowledge and overarching goals gain deeper access to its ancient reservoirs of elemental knowledge and power. Such ambitious agents would do well to seek out opportunities to make a name for themselves. Fortunately for [[Pathfinders]] interested in gaining influence, the Society's contact in the Concordance is a direct emissary to the Cycle of Five. He is the faction leader: [[Ashasar]], Liaison to the Seat of Balance, a [[Suli|suli]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] with an airship-shaped [[Air elemental|air elemental]] [[Animal companion|companion]], as well as three other [[Elemental|elemental]] companions.
> The Concordance brings to the Pathfinder Society a fresh perspective on [[Golarion]] combined with a rich reservoir of planar and elemental knowledge. The Pathfinder Society has shown the Concordance that Golarion is a [[Planet|world]] worth exploring in much more detail. From the erratic magic of the [[Mana Wastes]] to the [[Eye of Abendego|Abendego-battered]] Sodden Lands, the Concordance has just begun to scratch the surface. The Concordance is a nature faction, but it is not a typical nature faction. Its members respect nature, and typical nature-themed Pathfinders like druids and [[PathfinderWiki/Ranger|rangers]] are quite welcome in its ranks. However, it is more likely to find someone in the Concordance trying to channel the essence of a hurricane than you are to find them attempting to befriend every [[Plant|plant]] and [[Animal|animal]] they meet.
