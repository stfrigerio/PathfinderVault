> The **Varisian Council** is one of the three governing bodies (along with the [[Office of the Lord-Mayor]] and the [[Council of Ushers]]) of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]]. It was created to help address the needs and concerns of the city's [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisian]] people; it has little power in the city otherwise. It is headquartered among the colorful tents and wagons of Magnimar's [[Keystone]] neighborhood. It is currently led by the elderly [[Remeria Callinova]].


## History

> The Varisian Council was created around [[4630 AR]] by the city's elders to make sure the traditions and rights of the area's Varisian population would be protected. The Council was originally headquartered in a building just to the west of its current location, but it burned down in [[4701 AR]] in a fire set by the mad painter [[Goren Andosalu]], which also destroyed several other buildings.
