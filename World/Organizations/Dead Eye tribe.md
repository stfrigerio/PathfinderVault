> The **Dead Eye tribe** is a clan of [[Orc|orcs]] who live in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. They live in crude villages scattered throughout the [[Kodar Mountains]], near the [[Brimstone Haruspex]]. Their primary religion is that of a one-eyed orc deity. Although the name of this entity has been lost, they claim it to be [[Rovagug]]'s father.
> The mountain orcs of the Dead Eye tribe are primitive and cruel even by orc standards. Their filthy caves are located between the Brimstone Haruspex and the [[Dirt Sea]]. They used to raid against "civilized" tribes and eat their victims. They consider themselves the keepers of the original orc culture. The [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarian]] [[Faceripper]] is the current leader of the Dead Eye tribe. The ancient one-eyed deity they worship is called [[Brumash]].
