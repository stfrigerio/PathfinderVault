> The **Gold Crown Shipping and Mining Company**, also known as the **Gold Crown Company** or simply **Gold Crown**, is an organization in [[Sargava]] that specializes in transporting goods by river. Its current leader is [[Krieve]].


## History

> The Gold Crown Company was originally founded as a mining company, but following the success of the [[Deeptreasure Mining Company]], it was edged out of that sector. Gold Crown still sells supplies to Deeptreasure and other mining companies, but its main focus now is as a general shipping company.


## Business practices

> Gold Crown has a reputation for being willing to transport nearly anything almost anywhere, sometimes as soon as a client desires it. However, most of their business is done by river-bound barges that traverse the treacherous [[Korir River]] Delta, and sometimes the rivers of the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. The Company also ships cargo from [[Port Freedom]] to [[Anthusis|Eleder]]. It conducts overland shipping by caravan, and can provide transport as far north as the [[Sodden Lands]], [[Osirion]], and [[Katapesh]].
> In addition to shipping, the Company has some unusual interests. Krieve's friends [[Valmor]] and Skort, both seasoned [[Adventurer|adventurers]], are sometimes employed by [[Kalabuto|Kalabutos]] [[Alban person|General Alban]] to spy on the city of [[Mzali]]. The Gold Crown Company also has a contract with Othor Vibius to explore the [[Stasis Fields]].
