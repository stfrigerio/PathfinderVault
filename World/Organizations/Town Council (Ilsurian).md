> The **town council of [[Ilsurian]]**, in [[4713 AR]], comprises:

> - Irriley Braeton, the head of the council
> - Milon Kesseric, the secretary
> - Ambator Ausperious
> - Palaxarn Hespion
> - Dharla Khesteror
> - [[Vea Semere]], the only non-[[Human|human]] member
> The council meets and hears issues in the Council House. The public's interest in civic matters is high so the benches in this long, low-ceilinged building are full, with more citizens around the windows to watch the proceedings. The council has even contracted Genthus Duggern to print the minutes from its weekly meetings for public consumption.
