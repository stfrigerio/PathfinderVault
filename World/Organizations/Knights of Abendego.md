> The grandiosely self-titled **Knights of Abendego** are the largest of the [[Norgorber]]-worshipping [[Sodden Lands]] gangs collectively known as the [[Sodden Scavengers]].
> They operate in the vicinity of [[Jula]], and are steadily increasing their control over the townâ€”much to the dismay of the town's leader, [[Father Heveril]].
> Gang members dress in dark clothing and scale armour decorated with fish motifs. Their preferred weapons are tridents and gaffs.
> Knights of Abendego are led by [[Ajbal Kimon]], an ambitious young scavenger claiming to have descended from [[Lirgen|Lirgeni]] blood.
