> With the creation of the [[Korvosa|Korvosan]] monarchy, the **magistrates** and their bureaucratic underlings managed to justify their existences to the city's first king, [[Eodred Arabasti I|Eodred I]]. Today, City Hall houses twenty-three magistrates, with a combined staff of nearly a hundred. Most Korvosans suspect that the entire purpose of City Hall is to waste the time and money of the city's people. The three most prominent magistrates are the [[Garrick Tann|Magistrate of Commerce]] (the most hated man in Korvosa), who oversees the collection of taxes; the [[Syl Gar|Magistrate of Expenditures]] (one of the best-loved men in Korvosa), who spends the money collected by the Magistrate of Commerce; and the [[Lolia Perenne|Magistrate of Regulation]], who maintains fixed weights and measurements, ensuring everyone within the city operates on a level playing field.
