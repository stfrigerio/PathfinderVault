> The **Radiant Oath** is a minor faction within the [[Pathfinder Society]], whose mission is to encourage acts of kindness and compassion.


## Goals

> Although similar in some ways to the older [[Silver Crusade faction|Silver Crusade]], the Radiant Oath is less about aggressive confrontation with [[Evil|evil]] and more about nurturing [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|goodness]]. However, it will take up arms against evil when necessary.
