> The [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] of the [[Pale Mountain]] region consists of several smaller and mostly disorganized tribes united under the rule of the [[Carrion King]]. The Carrion Tribe gnolls have mostly abandoned the worship of [[Lamashtu]] for that of [[Rovagug]].
> From his throne upon Pale Mountain's slopes, the Carrion King commands hundreds of gnolls. Among the ramshackle hordes, bands of raiders and slavers, and lone murderers, four noteworthy tribes serve the warlord: [[Al'Chorhaiv|AlChorhaiv]], [[The Circle]], [[Three Jaws]] and [[Wormhollow]].
> Lesser tribes of Pale Mountain are the [[Al'Vohr's Hunters|AlVohrs Hunters]], [[The Ghulveis]], [[The Sordaiv]], and the [[Wyrmslaves]].
