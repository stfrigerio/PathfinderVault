> The **Golden Legion** is one of three branches of [[Andoran|Andorans]] [[Eagle Knights]]. While the bold [[Steel Falcons]] and secretive [[Twilight Talons]] frequently operate outside of Andoran, the Golden Legion serves alongside the Andoren Army as elite units and trainers and rarely leaves the country. [[Golden Legionnaire|Golden Legionnaires]], who are more formally referred to as Eagle Knights of the Golden Legion, wear distinctive gilded [[Plate armor|plate armor]] and [[Shield|shields]].


## Goal

> The Golden Legion exists to watch the borders of Andoran and secure its domestic trade routes. This latter task often takes it into the nation's wilder areas, where it keeps a close eye on monstrous threats and banditry.


## Structure

> The Golden Legion is led by [[Hedrik Traxxus|General Hedrik Traxxus]], who previously commanded a regiment of Eagle Knights in [[Carpenden]].
> One of the most famous regiments in the Golden Legion is the [[Diamond Regiment]], which operates under [[Ingrid Odeber|Commander Ingrid Odeber]] in [[Darkmoon Vale]]. It is widely rumored that Odeber is being groomed to eventually take General Traxxus' place.
