> The **Harbor Guard** is the district guard of the [[The Docks|Docks]] district of the city of [[Absalom]]. 
> Docks natives make up most of the recruits and these guards generally have an honest wish to make their home a safer place. However, for each purely dedicated Harbor Guard, there are two or more officers who secretly belong to a Docks-based gang, while other guards may be on their payroll. As a result, the Harbor Guard has an understandably mixed reputation.
> The Harbor Guard tends to turn a blind eye to most brawls and the like, as long as things never get out of hand. They are more concerned with fraudulent shipping manifests than knife attacks in dark alleys.
