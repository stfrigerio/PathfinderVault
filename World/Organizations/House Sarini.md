> **House Sarini** is one of the better-known noble families of [[Cheliax]]. Nicknamed the "Fools of Thrune" or the "Lapdogs of Hell", they are known for producing cruel and macabre fools and jesters who serve the crown. Members of the house are often sent to amuse crowds at public executions in [[Egorian]], entertaining the common folk with their dark and violent humor. It is currently unknown whether members of this house do this voluntarily, or if their debased profession is a result of an offence against [[House Thrune]].
