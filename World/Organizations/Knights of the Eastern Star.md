> At the height of [[Azlant|Imperial Azlant]], the **Knights of the Eastern Star** was one of the two sects of the [[Azlant|Azlanti]] shining order of armored [[Magus|magi]] known as the [[Knights of the Ioun Star]]. The [[Knights of the Western Star]] served the emperor and the empire's Throne of Glass, while the Knights of the Eastern Star searched the lands beyond the empire's borders for secret lore. 
> The few Knights of the Western Star who survived the [[Earthfall]] eventually came to serve the living [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]], while the Knights of the Eastern Star never believed that Aroden was truly the Last Azlanti. When Aroden died, the Knights of the Western Star faded from history, but the Knights of the Eastern Star have remained scattered throughout [[Avistan]] and beyond, searching for secret lore and the new ruler who would restore the glory of Azlant.
> The strongest faction of the Knights of the Eastern Star is the [[Apotheosis Almorain]], centered in [[Oppara]]. The [[Knight|knights]] focus their attention further to the east, in the [[Windswept Wastes]] of [[Casmaron]], where they believe a resurgent cult of the [[Ninshabur|Ninshaburian]] hero-god [[Namzaruum]] will produce the leader destined to become the next emperor of Azlant.
