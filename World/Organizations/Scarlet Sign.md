> The **Scarlet Sign** is one of the most insidious cults that lurks within the city of [[Vyre]]. It was founded by the [[Vrolikai|vrolikai]] [[Demon|demon]] [[Vissagho]] centuries ago as part of some sinister scheme but now serves as a secret society for nobles from across [[Cheliax]] who wish to maintain some sort of political influence in the City of Masks. The Scarlet Sign is based out of the abandoned [[Cathedral of Abadar Vyre|Cathedral of Abadar]] and is left to its own devices by the powers of the city. What Vissagho's ultimate plans for this strange cult actually are remains a mystery.
