> The **Empty Hand tribe** is an [[Orc|orc]] clan that controls the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[Sky citadel|sky citadel]] of [[Urgir]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. As a result of their formidable position, they are typically regarded as the *de facto* ruling tribe of Belkzen. 
> Ruled by the semi-civilized warlord [[Grask Uldeth]], the tribe has become relatively law-abiding (at least by orc standards) and welcoming of outsiders willing to trade. As a result of this cosmopolitan attitude, the Empty Hand orcs have become the best-armed force in the region, and rightfully feared by other tribes.
