## Old Luminous Order

The old Luminous Order was once a revered and influential organization within Promise Academy. However, as time passed, their pursuit of knowledge took a darker turn. Consumed by an insatiable thirst for power, the members of the old Luminous Order delved into forbidden magics and lost themselves in the pursuit of forbidden knowledge.

Their ambition led them to make dark pacts and forge alliances with malevolent entities. Gradually, their original mission of enlightenment and harmony was twisted into a hunger for dominion and control. They became corrupt and manipulative, using their knowledge and magic for selfish purposes.

[[Zephyrus]], a student within the old Luminous Order, stumbled upon an ancient book that once belonged to Mephistopheles, the Archduke of Hell. As Zephyrus delved into its pages, he became ensnared by the dark influence of the book and the whispers of Mephistopheles himself. Slowly, Zephyrus's heart and mind were corrupted, turning him into a vessel of evil.

The malevolent entity, now known as Zephyrus, saw an opportunity to exploit the growing darkness within the old Luminous Order. Masquerading as a source of power and promising unimaginable abilities to its members. With each new act of corruption, Zephyrus gained more control and influence over the order, gradually bending them to its will.

Once the old Luminous Order fully embraced the darkness, Zephyrus revealed its true form and unleashed its wrath upon them. The entity consumed the order, feeding off their magic and extinguishing their lives. The once-great order was wiped out, their legacy tarnished and forgotten by the academy.

## New Luminous Order

The new Luminous Order emerged as a group of unsuspecting and impressionable students within Promise Academy. They were drawn to the remnants of the old order's teachings, unaware of its dark history. They sought to emulate their predecessors, yearning for knowledge and power, hoping to make their mark in the world.

However, they were lured into Zephyrus' web of manipulation. The entity exploited their ambitions and offered them guidance, unknowingly leading them down a path of darkness. Blinded by their eagerness, they became unwitting pawns in Zephyrus' grand scheme.

The members of the new Luminous Order were initially driven by a desire to prove themselves, but as Zephyrus tightened its grip, their actions became increasingly malevolent and destructive. They carried out heinous acts under the entity's influence, their original intentions twisted beyond recognition.
