> The **Eastern Front Academy** is a school of [[Arcane magic|arcane magic]] and [[Alchemy|alchemy]] located in the far-eastern [[Taldor|Taldan]] city of [[Stavian's Hold|Stavians Hold]] in [[Porthmos Prefecture]]. It was founded by [[Diddima Ennoi|Baroness Diddima Ennoi]] to try and provide a local industry to the isolated town. Given its location on the fringes of the nation, the school only attracts those whose parents cannot afford to send them to the more prestigious schools in the west, as well as the non-inheriting sons and daughters of local artisans and merchants.
