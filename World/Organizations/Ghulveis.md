> The **Ghulveis** are the remnants of a [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]] tribe which has been afflicted with a terrible, flesh-wasting [[Disease|disease]] that was supposedly sent as punishment by [[Lamashtu]], the mother of gnolls. Numbering only five leper-like, gauze-wrapped [[Flind|flinds]] and a pack of [[Hyena|hyenas]], they serve the [[Carrion King]] as threats sent among those who displease him, for the other tribes all give the Ghulveis a wide berth whenever possible.
