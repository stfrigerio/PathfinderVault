> The **Council of the Sun and Sky** (sometimes termed the **Council of Sun and Sky**) acts as the government for the functional, day-to-day operations of [[Osirion]], and is composed of representatives appointed by regional governors or the [[Khemet III|Ruby Prince Khemet III]]. The council is led by [[Dahnakrist Phi|First Speaker Dahnakrist Phi]] and has been inundated by foreign diplomats from [[Cheliax]], [[Andoran]], [[Qadira]], and [[Taldor]] seeking audiences with the Ruby Prince. Only petitioners from Cheliax, Andoran, and [[Geb's Rest]] have recently managed to see the preoccupied ruler. The council's chambers are a glass-domed building in the [[Black Dome]] between the [[Palace of the Forthbringer]] and a main entrance gate of the Dome.
> The council's members are a mixture of corrupt bureaucrats and idealistic reformers. As a result, there is considerable political in-fighting. Five of the council's 100 members are elected from the [[Council of Liberated Slaves]] to represent the nation's [[Slavery|enslaved]] population.
