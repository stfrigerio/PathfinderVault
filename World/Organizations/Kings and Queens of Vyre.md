> The **Kings and Queens of Vyre** are a council of five secret members who rule the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Vyre]]. Despite the name the position of King or Queen of Vyre is not hereditary: the position goes to whomever is powerful enough to seize it. Due to their identities being secret, these positions often change hands without the public of Vyre being any the wiser. Each King or Queen is served by a group known as a [[Masks of Vyre|Mask]] that helps them implement their decrees. The current kings and queens are:

> - [[Mera Bantikere|Queen of Blades Mera Bantikere]], served by the [[Masks of Blades]]
> - [[Pirreta|Queen of Blood Pirreta]], served by the [[Masks of Blood]]
> - [[Manticce Kaleekii|Queen of Delights Manticce Kaleekii]], served by the [[Masks of Delights]]
> - [[Delaraius Solzakarr|King of Keys Delaraius Solzakarr]], served by the [[Masks of Keys]]
> - [[Simandu|Queen of Whispers Simandu]], served by the [[Masks of Whispers]]
> Unbeknownst to even the other Kings and Queens of Vyre, the Queen of Whispers and the King of Keys are both secretly devoted to [[Norgorber]] and are under the control of the Church of Norgorber.
