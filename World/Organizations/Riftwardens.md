*See also: [[Riftwarden]]*
> The **Riftwardens** are a loose collection of [[Plane|planar]] travelers from across the [[Great Beyond]] who guard the multiverse's integrity and stability. They aim to prevent [[Evil|evildoers]] from using [[Planar portal|planar gateways]] and punish any who they catch trying.



## Alliances

> The Riftwardens frequently ally with the Concordance of Elements, an organization that seeks to preserve the balance among the four [[Elemental force|elemental forces]] of air, earth,
fire, and water.


## On Golarion

> Riftwardens are believed to have come to [[Golarion]] in pursuit of their most-hated enemies, the [[Blackfire Adepts]]. Their purpose is the opposite of the Adepts, in that they seek to close planar openings and [[Portal|portals]]. They identify themselves by the Sign of the Seeker's Spiral and are extremely well-versed in the geography of the [[Great Beyond]], making them invaluable guides to those seeking to travel beyond the [[Material Plane]], especially in [[Magic|high magic]] cities such as [[Quantium]], [[Egorian]], and [[Absalom]]. Their greater motivations, beyond opposition to the Blackfire Adepts, are unknown, as is their secretive cabal of leaders, but they surely serve otherworldly interests.


### In Mendev

> The group is particularly active in [[Mendev]] and have set up a base of operations in the Librarium of the Broken Black Wing in the city of [[Kenabres]]. While the local leader of the organisation is unknown, their spokesperson, Beltran Ravenken, is a popular figure in town. The Riftwardens monitor the [[Worldwound]] carefully, deeply interested in sealing the [[Planar tear|planar tear]] that plagues the nation.


### Known members and associates

> - [[Aravashnial]]
> - Beltran Ravenken
> - [[Mara Ytrellian]] 

## Favored familiars

> Riftwardens choose [[Familiar|familiars]] native to the planes to which they feel most strongly connected. For example, Riftwardens on Golarion often choose ordinary [[Animal|animals]] like [[Cat|cats]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|dogs]], and [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Rabbit|rabbits]].
