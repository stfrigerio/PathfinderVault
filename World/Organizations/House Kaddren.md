> The **Kaddren family** is one of the founding families of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]]. Many of its members are heavily involved in the city's magical scene. The family is a strong supporter of the [[Golemworks]], but holds itself back from becoming a full sponsor, not wishing to become too closely associated with that establishment's working-class reputation. Kaddren children who show magical promise are sent off to the best magical colleges in the [[Inner Sea region]], with the exception of the [[Acadamae]] in [[Korvosa]]. The current head of the house is [[Zimandi Kaddren]], a young woman who only recently came to power after her parents' apparent untimely demise.
