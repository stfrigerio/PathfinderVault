> The **Chorus of Malignant Symmetry** was one of two heretical [[Protean|protean]] choruses that became obsessed with exploring the [[Abyss]] in the earliest days of the [[Multiverse|multiverse]]. The proteans were the first inhabitants of the [[Outer Planes]], dwelling within the infinite chaos of the [[Maelstrom]] in perfect harmony. After countless eons during this pre-history of the multiverse period, the proteans stumbled upon yawning rifts piercing the skin of the Maelstrom and, unbeknownst to them, leading into the depths of the [[Abyss]]. The Chorus of Malignant Symmetry became obsessed with exploring these rifts, bringing them into contact, and then murderous war with the [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]]. Though the war between proteans and qlippoth may have been inevitable, many blame the Chorus of Malignant Symmetry (as well as the [[Chorus of Razored Discord]]) for hastening it and reshaping reality, for in the wake of this war (according to protean historians) the rest of multiverse formed.
