> The **Ghost Wolves** are a [[Kellid]] tribe in the [[Sellen Hills]] region of [[Numeria]] with an affinity for the old Kellid ways and a fierce hatred of [[Technology|technology]]. Their name derives from both their swift, nomadic strikes and their unusual use of [[Magic|magic]]â€”particularly [[Laser|laser-nullifying]] invisibilityâ€”to strike. They are led by [[Xol-Nomag]], a fear-inspiring, ferocious chieftain.
> The tribe battles its way through the [[Technic League]] and [[Robot|robots]], not out of fear but rather in anger and pursuit of their [[Skymetal|skymetals]], which they forge into keen [[Weapon|weapons]]. They also destroy technological artifacts as part of their attempts to demonstrate their superiority over technology. One of the tribe's greatest victories was against a horned, red-skinned [[Evaluator robot|evaluator robot]]; however, the robot's explosion after it was destroyed killed many of the tribe's barbarians.
