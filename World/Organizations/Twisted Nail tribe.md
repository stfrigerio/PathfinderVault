> The **Twisted Nail** are a tribe of what is colloquially referred to as "mountain [[Orc|orcs]]": primitive clans who live in the high mountains of the [[Hold of Belkzen]], and who are seen as violent and uncultured by the lowland tribes. The Twisted Nail tribe lives in the northern [[Mindspin Mountains]], and are known to prefer the flesh of their own kind over any other meat.
