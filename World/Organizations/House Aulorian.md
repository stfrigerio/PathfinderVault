> **House Aulorian** are one of the nine noble houses of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Kintargo]] that make up the prominent [[Court of Coin]]. House Aulorian are known to be more slightly more loyal to the city of Kintargo itself than to the Chelish Crown or [[House Thrune]], but their allegiances have begun leaning more towards Cheliax than Kintargo. House Aulorian's primary interests are in the [[Salt|salt]] and [[Silver|silver]] trade, but they are also known to dabble in [[Magic|magic]], and many members of the House possess a greater than normal aptitude for [[Magic|spellcraft]].
