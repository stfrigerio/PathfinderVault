> The **Time Callers** are a civic organization found exclusively in the [[Coins|Coins district]] of [[Absalom]]. They wander about the district at night, proclaiming the turn of every hour on the hour. This helps promote trade within the district, whose shops, markets, and other businesses stay open most of, if not all night.
