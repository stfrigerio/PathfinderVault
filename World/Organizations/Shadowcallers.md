> The **shadowcallers** of the [[Dusk Hall]] in [[Nidal|Nidals]] capital, [[Pangolais]], are students and masters of the [[Kuthite]] arts of [[Shadowcasting|shadowcasting]]. Nearly all shadowcallers are [[Wizard|wizards]] who survived years of brutal training as children, learning to harness and focus painâ€”their own as well as others'â€”into divinely enhanced arcane power. Shadowcallers also learn to [[Magic/Conjuration|summon and bind]] creatures from the [[Plane of Shadow]] into the [[Material Plane]], and are prized interrogators often assigned to assist in [[Cheliax|Chelish]] counter-insurgency operations.
