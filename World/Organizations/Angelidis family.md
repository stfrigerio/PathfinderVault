> The **Angelidis family** is one of the three merchant families which formed the small [[Lambreth|River Kingdom of Lambreth]]. The Angelidis family founded the town of [[Lockridge]] in [[4394 AR]] and has been ruling the town ever since then. Fearing annexation from their neighbors, the three families negotiated a union, ruling the region as the [[Triunes of Lambreth]], in [[4502 AR]]. When Lambreth was threatened by imminent invasion from neighbouring [[Razmiran]] in [[4675 AR]], the Triune, in desperation, offered the lordship of the realm to [[Kamdyn Arnefax]] if he could defeat the invaders. When Arnefax returned victorious from the battle against the Razmiri invaders and demanded the lordship of Lambreth, the Angelidis family as well as [[Vizcarra family]] swore fealty at once, while [[Tandre Cullerton|Master Tandre Cullerton]], who resisted, was killed immediately, and the [[Cullerton family|Cullertons]] were dispossessed and exiled under penalty of death.
> [[Morissa Angelidis]] is the elected mayor of Lockridge, travelling to [[Maashinelle]] only upon matters of importance.
