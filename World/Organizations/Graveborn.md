> The **Graveborn** are one of the [[Eloko]] tribes that inhabit the eastern [[Mwangi Expanse]] town of [[Elokolobha]], located on the boundary of the [[Screaming Jungle]]. Each male member of this tribe must survive a grueling rite of passage in which the youth must survive potent [[Poison|toxins]] and dig his way out of a deep grave to join the tribe as an adult. [[Ukabalimeli|Ukabalimeli the Manslayer]] is the tribe's chieftain.
> The Graveborn tribe claims the most territory of the city, almost the entire northern third of it, called the [[Ukabalimeli-Bara]]. Perhaps the oldest part of the city, it contains half-carved towers, temples, bridges, and barricades. The most impressive of these structures is [[Eastblock]], a massive wedge of carved stone. Inside its hollow walls, a 1,000-foot-tall staircase permits entrance to the city without the need to climb the dangerous crags. Other important structures in Ukabalimeli-Bara are the Temple of Withering, the Fallen Gate, and a massive tower called Coldblock.
