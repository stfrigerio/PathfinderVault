> **The Office of the Lord-Mayor** is one of the two ruling bodies of [[Magnimar]], alongside the [[Council of Ushers]]. However, due to the constant internal squabbling amongst the council, the lord-mayor is by far Magnimar's most politically powerful person. The current lord-mayor is [[Sabriyya Kalmeralm]].



## Powers

> In theory, the lord-mayor has to obey any mandate agreed upon by the Council of Ushers, although the previous lord-mayor, [[Haldmeer Grobaras]], completely ignored council mandates on several occasions. The lord-mayor is allowed to issue mandates to deal with important and immediate issues, but these decrees do not have to be approved by the council.


## History


### Haldmeer Grobaras

> The previous lord-mayor, Haldmeer Grobaras, embodied many of the worst possible abuses from such a powerful position. Haldmeer had claimed the largest residence in the city, [[Defiant's Garden|Defiants Garden]] as his own; he had worn only the finest and most expensive [[Cheliax|Chelaxian]] fashion; and he had made many important decisions based almost entirely on the quality of the bribe each side had offered him.
> Haldmeer abused the powers of his office and used them to issue horribly biased and sometimes downright damaging decrees. Only his assistant [[Valanni Krinst]], who had to implement the lord-mayor's decrees, prevented him from doing far more damage to the city by ignoring or altering many of them.
