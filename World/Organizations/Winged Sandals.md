> The **Winged Sandals** is an order of dedicated messengers in [[Absalom]] who worship [[Iomedae]]. Their base of operations is the [[Blue Tower]], one of the tallest buildings in the city, in [[Eastgate]] district. The Winged Sandals claim their origins back to [[Aroden]] and it is said that Aroden himself commanded them to be ready to deliver messages to anywhere in the world. When magical means of communication don't work, aren't trusted, or are very expensive, the Winged Sandals are capable of delivering a message to any place on the map. The cost is 1 gp per page within the [[Inner Sea]], but messages can cost much more depending on the difficulty of the task.
