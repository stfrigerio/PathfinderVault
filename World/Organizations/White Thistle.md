> The **White Thistle** faction of [[Pezzack|Pezzacki]] rebels pursues independence for the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] town through inspired unity.
> Unlike the town's Galtan faction, the White Thistle eschews violence in favor of producing and distributing seditious works. Their reputation among Pezzacki residents, however, suggests a lack of interest in governing the town and a potential fascination with martyrdom.
