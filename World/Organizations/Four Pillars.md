> The **Four Pillars** are a council made up of the former ruling families of the provinces of modern day [[Shokuro]] and are based in its capital of [[Mukinami]]. After the fall of [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]] in [[4606 AR]], the families of the Four Pillars each ruled over one of the four provinces that now comprise Shokuro as absolute rulers. Warring with each other relentlessly, these feuds resulted in nothing but destruction. With the former breadbasket of the Lung Wa Empire under threat, neighbouring [[Lingshen]] invaded putting an end to the absolute rule of the four families.
> When Lingshen was eventually ousted by [[Shokuro Toriaka]], the man who would come to be the Sun Shogun, he gathered the leaders of these four families to him to help him rule the newly freed Shokuro. Thus the Four Pillars were born, however, they have struggled to put aside the historic grudges that originally led them to war with each other over the four provinces.
