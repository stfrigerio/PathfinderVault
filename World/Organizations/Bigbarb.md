> **Bigbarb** is a [[Goblin|goblin]] tribe in the [[Shackles]] that lays claim to [[Skinny Whale Bay]]. The Bigbarb goblins use their dugout [[Canoe|canoes]] as [[Weapon|weapons]]. Each canoe features a prow equipped with a ram and twisted spikes. The canoe is propelled by as many as ten goblin paddlers, and can strike [[Ship|ships]] with surprising force. Often the goblins hit their target, abandon their canoe and swim to shore, waiting for the targeted ship to sink and its crew to drown before returning to loot the wreck.
