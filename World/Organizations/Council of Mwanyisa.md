> The **Council of Mwanyisa** is an order of shaman-priests in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. They overthrew the sun kings of [[Mzali]] and ruled their empire in their stead. Under their rule, the empire fell, until only Mzali was left, and even that fell into decay.
> One hundred years ago, the Council received a vision that the empire would rise again. They also came across the mummified remains of one of the sun kings, the child-god [[Walkena]]. The [[Mummy|mummy]] animated to defend Mzali from attack by forces from nearby [[Kalabuto]], and then took over the rule of the city from the Council. The shamans now preach the word of Walkena to the populace.
