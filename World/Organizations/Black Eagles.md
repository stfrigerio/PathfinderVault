> The **Black Eagles** is the name of the 50 heavily armed horsemen of [[Kamdyn Arnefax|Lord Kamdyn Arnefax]], dictator of the [[Lambreth|River Kingdom of Lambreth]]. They roam across the realm, usually at night with the company of [[Shadow mastiff|shadow mastiffs]], collecting taxes, delivering official edicts, and pronouncing judgement of life and death upon the people. They are much feared but also respected as they protect the citizens with ruthless efficiency against invaders and bandits. Arnefax formed the Black Eagles as a dark equivalent of the [[Eagle Knights|Andoren Eagle Knights]].
