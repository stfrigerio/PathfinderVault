> The **Cult of the Dawnflower** it is a well-meaning but militant sect of the Church of [[Sarenrae]]. It is very popular and influential in [[Qadira]], and was one of the groups lobbying for the eventual Qadiran intervention in [[Osirion]].


## History

> Once Osirion was brought under the control of Keleshite satraps in the name of the Emperor, it was public policy to encourage the worship of Sarenrae as a means of bringing Osirion closer to the Empire. As a result, the cult established itself in Osirion as well. The Cult's growing popularity alarmed successive satraps, and in [[2217 AR]], the cult's leaders were exiled to the deserts of [[Thuvia]].
> A section of the Cult, led by a priestess called Vedie, chose instead to flee south into what would become [[Katapesh]]. This section split into two groups. One group founded a settlement called [[Sarenrae's Bastion|Sarenraes Bastion]] and the other founded the [[Golden City]].
> In [[2253 AR]] the satrap was found dead in one of his fountains, with sunflowers in his mouth. The Cult returned from exile in Thuvia, and the new ruler of Osirion was an independent Keleshite sultan rather than a satrap ruling in the name of the emperor.
> Centuries later, when [[Khemet I]] ousted the last sultan and restored the rule of Osirian [[Pharaoh|pharaohs]], the Cult of the Dawnflower and the Church of Sarenrae in general were instrumental in his rise to power. In fact, they had entered into a secret alliance with Khemet a year before his official proclamation of rulership.
> Elsewhere, Qadira invaded [[Taldor]] in [[4079 AR]], resulting in five hundred years of conflict between the two nations. Taldor's [[Stavian I|Grand Prince Stavian I]] came to believe that Qadira's invasion had been assisted by members of the Cult of the Dawnflower. As a result he outlawed the worship of [[Sarenrae]] in [[4528 AR]].
