> The **Wildwood Lodge** is an ancient order of [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] who reside within the [[Verduran Forest]] of central [[Avistan]].



## Moot of Ages

> Every year on the summer solstice the druids of the Wildwood Lodge meet for a [[Moot of Ages]] on the [[Isle of Arenway]] in the [[Sellen River]]. For these gatherings, druids from all over [[Golarion]] travel there to present their findings to the assembled [[Green Faith|Old Faith]] community. Conclusions are generally not reached through logic and the enforcing of dogma, but rather by listening for and interpreting the [[Will of the World]], the collective intelligence of nature itself.


## Relations with Taldor

> The central mission of the Wildwood Lodge is the protection of the Verduran Forest, particularly the parts of the massive woodland found within the borders of [[Taldor]]. Their connection to Taldor is particularly strong because of the signing of the [[Treaty of the Wildwood]] in [[3841 AR]]. The Taldan government agreed to limit their logging of the precious [[Blackwood tree|blackwood trees]] within the forest, and hand over the logging itself to the [[Gnome|gnomes]] of the local town of [[Wispil]]. In exchange the druids of the lodge agreed to help control [[Fey|fey]] attacks on loggers and oversee the gnomish logging while balancing the needs of the forest with the Taldan shipyards' desire for high-quality lumber. This agreement was stipulated to last as long as the Taldan empire stands, and has been followed by both sides for almost 800 years to their mutual satisfaction.
> The Taldan government gives the druids of the Verduran great leeway in administrating the portions of the forest within their realm, treating the region more like a semi-autonomous prefecture. Once a year they send a representative to the Isle of Arenway to reaffirm Taldor's commitment to the Treaty of the Wildwood. The envoy steps foot on the beach of the island and exchanges a symbolic bag of seeds for a piece of fine wood with a senior member of the lodge before heading back downriver to [[Cassomir]].
> The government of the port city of Cassomir (where the majority of [[Taldan Imperial Navy|Taldors navy]] is built) has a particularly strong relationship with the druids of the Wildwood Lodge. The latter are allowed to enter the city freely and even recruit for their organization among the city's youth. The people of Cassomir are quite aware that keeping the druids happy is vital not only to their economy, but to the safety of Taldor as a whole, as the navy is Taldor's first (and strongest) line of defense against foreign invasion.


## Allies

> Even though druids can be formidable combatants in their own right, the Wildwood Lodge also employs a large number of [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]] to act as their intermediaries.


## Enemies

> The Wildwood Lodge has a somewhat confrontational relationship with the governments of [[Andoran]] and [[Galt]], who count portions of the Verduran Forest as part of their realms. The druids have no agreements with these nations, and they in turn plunder the forest to feed their need for lumber and other natural resources. The lodge grants representatives of these governments no protection from the fey and other dangers of the forest either, however.
> Recently, a small circle of druids calling themselves Nature's Cataclysm has been causing trouble in Cassomir by working with a cult of [[Groetus]] to kidnap anyone working in the [[Imperial Naval Shipyards]]. They believe the Wildwood Lodge has given up too much of the forest to [[Human|human]] despoilment, and seek to restore the dominance of nature.
