> The **Smoke Knights** is a secretive thieves' guild based in [[Absalom]] that follow a sort of [[Knight|chivalric code]] and pride themselves on performing only the most grandiose crimes of theft and robbery. Among their many edicts is the rule that a Smoke Knight must take her own life before revealing the existence of the order or the names of their fellow guild members. The current Knight Marshal of the Smoke Knights is Trademaster Horner Shan, also known as "the Gargoyle."
