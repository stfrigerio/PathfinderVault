> The **Broken Spine** [[Orc|orc]] tribe occupies an abandoned keep in the foothills of the [[Mindspin Mountains]], known as [[Heliu's Folly|Helius Folly]]. The members of this tribe have a deep hatred of [[Human|humans]], and especially of [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]]. Their current leader is the bloodthirsty, nearly insane Chief [[Hogrot]] although the tribe is led from behind the scenes by their [[Shaman|shaman]] [[Magra the Mad]].


## History

> The Broken Spine tribe sacked the [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of [[Urglin]] in [[4518 AR]], but was defeated by warriors of the [[Shoanti]] [[Sklar-Quah]] and [[Lyrune-Quah]] at the [[Battle of the Shadefields]] the [[4519 AR|following year]].
> A Pathfinder named [[Eando Kline]] burned down Broken Spine's winter headquarters of Heliu's Folly in [[4707 AR]]. Their chief at the time, [[Kroghut]], survived the inferno but he had to flee in order to avoid his execution for incompetence by his humiliated tribe.
