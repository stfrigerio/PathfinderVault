> The **Bloodstone Conservatory** was established in [[4378 AR]] to train [[Conjurer|conjurers]] and [[Summoner|summoners]] by the eleventh queen of [[Irrisen]], [[Kseniya|Queen Kseniya]], who was herself a skilled conjurer. The conservatory is administrated to this day by her descendants and is located in the town of [[Czarny Las]] in the [[Feyfrost]] region of the country. The school hosts only 20 pupils at any given time, and its admission policies are time-consuming, labyrinthine, and socially demanding.
