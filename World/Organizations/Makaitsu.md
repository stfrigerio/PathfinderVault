> The **Makaitsu** are a group of [[Kami|kami]] who dwell in the [[Sea of Eels]] off the coast of the nation of [[Shokuro]]. These kami, ancient spirits created by the [[Deity|gods]] to protect nature, who make up the Makaitsu have long served as protectors of Shokuro's humble fisherfolk. In the depths of the Sea of Eels dwell enormous predatory [[Eel|eels]] with strange [[Magic|magical]] powers. Traditionally, the Makaitsu kami have kept these monsters at bay but, recently, the kami have disappeared without a trace and the massive eels now hunt along the coast of Shokuro once again.
