> The **Blood Gars** is a [[Kellid]] tribe of [[Numeria]] who live close to the rivers of the southern reaches of [[Numerian Plains]] ([[Seven Tears River]], [[West Sellen River]], and [[Dagger River]]). They are violent, water-dwelling barbarians and river [[Pirate|pirates]] who savage their victims and leave suffering and gore in their wake. They travel the riverways whenever possible and carry their [[Ship|flat-bottomed boats]] overland when needed. 
> The Blood Gars value fear and plunder, and often raid riverside villages but also attack river travelers when they find the opportunity. Their cruelty is notorious and they always find new methods of execution for particularly stubborn foes. The tribe frequently raid into the western [[River Kingdoms]] and [[Razmiran]], and even as far south as [[Galt]]. 
> The Blood Gars' current chieftain is Ghorak Maul-Hand, who has demanded increased tribute and has plans to attack the [[Protectorate of the Black Marquis]]. Some say that Ghorak has some sort of blood feud with the [[Urdul Bazzak|Black Marquis Urdul Bazzak]].
> The [[Tarnished Halls]], a travelling market of [[Technology|technology]], relies on the Blood Gars for protection from the [[Technic League]].
