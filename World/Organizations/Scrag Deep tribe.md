> The [[Scrag|aquatic trolls]] of the **Scrag Deep tribe** played an important role in the victory of the army of [[Baba Yaga]] in the [[Winter War]] and as a reward, Baba Yaga gave the scrags dominion over the extensive underwater caverns at the deepest point of the [[Glacier Lake]], now known as [[Scrag Deep]]. The tribe is still led by descendants of their ancient warlord [[Tirchagac]]. Each of the tribe's warlords takes on the "war-name" of its ancestor. The current [[Tirchagac current|Tirchagac]] is a particularly loathsome brute and [[Helkgen]] townsfolk have paid the scrags enormous tribute in order to avoid bloody raids. Challengers to Tirchagac's authority who have been shown up in the tribe are Mhraggat and the "Mother of Carnage" Piyakak getting a growing number of supporters among the young members of the tribe.
