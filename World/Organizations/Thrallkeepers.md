> The **Thrallkeepers** were a conclave of powerful [[Thaumaturgist|thaumaturgists]] in ancient [[Thassilon]], that operated in the [[Fenwall Mountains]] at the service of the [[Runelords|runelords]], and specifically the [[Krune|Runelord of Sloth]].
> They experimented with [[Summoning|summoning]] all matter of horrors to further the cause of their runelord overlords. They thought their techniques were flawless, summoned numerous otherworldly creatures, and attempted to force them into servitude by using summoning circles to bind the creatures to their vaults. Records suggest that some of the creatures they attempted to summon originated in the [[Dark Tapestry]].
> The Thrallkeepers became extinct long ago, but some of several of their forgotten projects remain, lurking in ancient, abandoned vaults. The [[Glabrezu|glabrezu]] [[Demon|demon]] [[Koth'Vaul|KothVaul]] that was imprisoned in the Black Edifice, and the [[Havero|havero]] of the [[Acropolis of the Thrallkeepers]], are examples of creatures they tried to bind to their service.
