> The **Water Lords** are the three undisputed rulers of the [[Karazh]] capital of [[Ular Kel]], though they often rule with a light touch. Recognition as one of the Water Lords is entirely dependent on controlling one of the city's three [[Water Houses]] and, as such, a portion of all the city's water. While this may sound chaotic and has led to periods of bloodshed and violence, for the most part, control of the Water Houses is passed down within the aristocratic families of the city. Currently, the [[Ihnkara family]], led by [[Azat Ihnkara]], controls one Water House and [[Comelis Nurasili]] and the [[Nurasili family]] control one of the others. The southern Water House, however, is controlled not by a noble family but by a group of powerful merchants called the [[Concord of Peers]], a new development in the city's politics.
> The first Water Lord was [[Altyn Batyr]], who founded Ular Kel, fortified a strategically positioned oasis in the [[Grass Sea]] where the roads between the [[Kelesh|Padishah Empire of Kelesh]], [[Vudra|Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra]], the [[Castrovin Sea]], and distant [[Kaladay]] crossed.
