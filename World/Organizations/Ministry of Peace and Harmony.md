> The **Ministry of Peace and Harmony** is an infamous bureau on [[Bachuan]]'s government. Among its other functions, the ministry tightly controls the presence of foreigners in the [[Communism|communist]] republic. However, it offers permits to a small number of adventurers to explore remote parts of the nation, especially the [[Szaezan Crags]], in search of hidden caches left over from the imperial pre-revolution government. Such explorers are rewarded with 30% of their loot; the rest is impounded by the government.
