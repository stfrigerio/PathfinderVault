> The **Kaneano** are a tribe of [[Adaro|adaro]] who live in the sea around [[Ilizmagorti]] on [[Mediogalti]]. There are tales of shipwrecked sailors being rescued by the Kaneano, but there are just as many stories of them eating such folk instead.
> Many of the locals see the Kaneano as a good thing, helping to keep down the numbers of [[Devilfish|devilfish]], [[Reefclaw|reefclaws]], [[Shark|sharks]] and other dangerous sea creatures. They sometimes leave offerings for them in out-of-the-way places.
> It is accepted that the Kaneano know the reefs around Mediogalti Island better than any land-dwelling navigator, and they are much sought after as pilots. However, they rarely agree to do so.
> Rumour has it that Kaneano [[Shaman|shamans]] possess great wisdom in matters of the sea, and might even be able to grant wishes. Some say a shaman will agree to aid a land-dweller in return for a black pearl of exceptional quality.
