> The **Seven Tooth** tribe of [[Goblin|goblins]] operates in [[Shank's Wood|Shanks Wood]] near [[Sandpoint]] in [[Varisia]]. They are surprisingly strong-willed; instead of attacking travelers in the woods, they limit their raids to Sandpoint's [[Junk Beach]], where they gather [[Weapon|weapons]] and gear discarded by the townspeople.



## Leadership

> The tribe does not have a set leader. Instead, they follow the lead of the meanest and most resilient goblin. Sometimes a [[Bugbear|bugbear]] or a particular goblin organizes the tribe, but due to the violent nature of goblins, these self-made chieftains usually die during a mutiny before long.


## Enemies

> The bugbears of the wood tend to ambush the goblins as much as they do travelers.
> [[Shalelu Andosana]], a [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|ranger]] from Sandpoint, has led raids into the wood in response to some overzealous raiding along the [[Lost Coast Road]].
> [[Harpy|Harpies]] from the nearby islands of [[Three Cormorants]] have recently raided the Seven Tooth tribe, but these attacks have slowly been subsiding.


## Allies

> The cult of [[Lamashtu]] used the tribe as a recruitment center, practising [[Mutant|mutation]] [[Magic|magic]] on them.
