> The **Ijo** are a tribe of [[MwangiBonuwat|Bonuwat]] who live in villages along the coast of [[Desperation Bay]] in [[Sargava]]. They are arguably the friendliest of the various Mwangi tribes. They have been trading with the Sargavan colonists since [[4178 AR]].
> They fish the bay and sell much of their catch in [[Anthusis|Eleder]]. Some Ijo live near Gozreh's Crest to the north of Eleder, a site revered for holding the nest of a [[Ercinee|stormbird]].
> They prefer to dress in little more than loincloths, but those who visit Eleder regularly may supplement this by wearing banana-leaf cloaks in order to avoid causing embarrassment to "civilised" onlookers.
> The pirates of the [[Ombo]] tribe frequently prey on the Ijo, and they also clash with the Bay's [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] population.
