> The **Mercenary League** is the national military of the nation of [[Druma]]. Its members are often heavily armoured and are also known as the "**Blackjackets**" within Druma, both individually and collectively, as they wear black uniforms and black coats in contrast to the majority of Druma's residents, who are followers of the [[Prophecies of Kalistrade]] and are thus clad all in white. 
> The Blackjackets, as befitting the army of a nation of wealth-hungry traders, is lavishly equipped with the most expensive of [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] and receives the best training. As a result, they are steadfast in their loyalty to their masters, being described as almost [[Golem|golem-like]] in their devotion. This loyalty leads to a level of ruthlessness unmatched by most fighting forces, as the Blackjackets are unflinching and amoral when following the orders of the [[Resplendent Bureaucracy]]. In addition to the usual duties of a soldier, the Blackjackets are often tasked with the responsibility of guarding Druman caravans and trading expeditions around the [[Inner Sea]], since the wealth of Druma attracts a lot of unwanted attention.


> The [[Pathfinder Tales web fiction]] story "[[Armored]]" follows a group of Blackjackets.
