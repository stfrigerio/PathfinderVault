> The **Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth** are a secretive society of [[Baphomet]] worshippers who inhabit many of [[Golarion|Golarions]] largest cities. Taking their name from [[Ivory Labyrinth|Baphomets Abyssal realm]], members of the Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth often wield great political power within their cities. They always keep their allegiances to the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] Baphomet concealed and the secret societies they found often appear harmless or innocuous. The rituals and teachings of Baphomet are normally handed down from generation to generation within the politically influential families which form the backbone of each city's Templar cult. Members of the Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth from different cities recognise each other by special hand gestures, signs, and passwords. It is from the coded messages between different cults that their name arises, as in these messages they always refer to themselves as Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth. Baphomet's [[Glabrezu|glabrezu]] [[Demon|demon]] servants work alongside the Templars, advising them and setting up new Baphomet cults.
