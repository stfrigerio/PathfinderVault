> The **House of Sky** is an aerie high in the [[Five Kings Range]] that is the home of the [[Giant owl|giant owls]] of the [[Fierani Forest]]. These intelligent creatures have been allied with the [[Elves|elves]] of [[Kyonin]] for millennia, but are quite mistrustful of any other [[Humanoid|humanoid]] who makes the dangerous trek to their home. They hate [[Treerazer]] and his [[Demon|demonic]] minions, and can be summoned by the rulers of Kyonin in times of need via enchanted whistles. They are led by [[Kreiagh|Winglord Kreiagh]], who oversees a council of owls who frequently disagree with one another, but whose every word is taken to heart. Travel to the House of Sky is quite dangerous on foot, and is most easily accomplished by flight.
