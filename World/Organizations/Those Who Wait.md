> The mechanical [[Aballonian|Aballonians]] are divided into two opposing schools of thought â€“ Those Who Wait and [[Those Who Become]]. They hold competing views as to their purpose and the role of their creators, the mysterious [[First Ones]]. The two philosophies co-operate in some areas, such as in the [[Automatrix]], but conflicts and even wars can sometimes erupt between them, usually over access to resources.
> Those Who Wait believe that the First Ones will one day return to guide them. They carry on with their ancient task of collecting raw materials and energy and striving to improve their race so that the First Ones will be pleased with their servants when they return. They also work diligently to guard and preserve the [[Cities of the First Ones]] until that day.
