> The **Golden Solidarity** was an ancient, short-lived splinter sect of the [[Prophecies of Kalistrade]]. Its members were known as **Golden Disciples**.



## History

> One of the numerous offshoots of the Prophecies of Kalistrade that arose in the wake of their [[Kalistrade|founders]] disappearance, the Golden Solidarity was not reconciled with the mainstream Kalistocrats after Kalistrade's resting place was found. Instead, the Golden Disciples took refuge in the [[Kellid]] city of [[Xin-Grafar|Kestrillon]] on [[Isle of Terror|Inteper Isle]], where they thrived and spread their possessions among the populace. However, this wealth eventually attracted the attention of [[Tar-Baphon]], who invaded Kestrillon in [[861 AR]]. The Golden Solidarity perished alongside Kestrillon's populace, and they continue to roam the renamed Isle of Terror as [[Undead|undead]] to this day.


## Goal

> The Golden Disciples believed that Kalistrade promoted personal wealth not to craft one's own afterlife, but to build personal cults of philanthropy and earn [[Immortality|immortality]] after death through worship. They wear saffron-gold clothing but refused to wear valuables, believing that the only public wealth should be distributed for personal glory.


## Relationships

> During its heyday, the Golden Solidarity's investor-theologians engaged in lively debates with mainstream Kalistocrats in [[Druma]], who saw their charity as reckless.
