> The **Sandpoint Mercantile League** was a small business endeavor created in [[4667 AR]] in [[Magnimar]] by four powerful merchant families, all of whom had designs on settling the region where the small town of [[Sandpoint]] now stands.  Rather than work against each other, they consolidated their efforts and formed the League. These four families, the Kaijitsu (glassmakers and jewelers), the Valdemars (shipbuilders and carpenters), the Scarnettis (loggers and millers), and the Deverins (farmers and brewers), sailed north to claim their land after securing the rights from the Magnimar Charterhouse. Yet when they arrived, they found the place already settled by a particularly large tribe of [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisians]], who held the region as a traditional place to spend the winter.
> Unwilling to change course, the Sandpoint Mercantile League began a series of talks with the Varisians, promising them an important place in the new township. Unfortunately, after a week of talks seemed to go nowhere, an impatient man named Alamon Scarnetti took matters into his own hands. Rounding up a group of his brothers and cousins, the Scarnettis mounted a murderous raid on the Varisian camp, intending to kill them all and leave evidence implicating local [[Goblin|goblins]] for the deed. Yet the Scarnettis, too drunk and overconfident, only managed to kill five Varisians before they were themselves forced to flee, leaving behind three of their own. The incident caused a several-month delay, but eventually amends were made and the town of Sandpoint was born.
> Today, the founding families still hold noble titles in Sandpoint as well as some level of power in Magnimar itself. The Sandpoint Mercantile League maintains an all-purpose building in the [[Capital District]], where citizens and travelers can perform a number of business matters.  Whether one needs to book passage on a ship, arrange for a caravan to take goods to other parts of [[Varisia]], or get a title or charter for a new real estate purchase or business venture.  The four noble families are no longer involved in the day-to-day workings of the league, though they maintain equal parts ownership of it, leaving the administration and organization of the company to [[Jasper Korvaski|Sir Jasper Korvaski]], a retired [[Paladin|paladin]] of [[Abadar]].
