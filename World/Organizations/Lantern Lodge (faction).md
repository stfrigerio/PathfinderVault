*For other meanings of "**Lantern Lodge**", please see [[Lantern Lodge disambiguation]].*
> The **Lantern Lodge faction** within the [[Pathfinder Society]] represented the interests of [[Venture-Captain]] [[Amara Li]] and the [[Dragon Empires]] of [[Tian Xia]].



## Background

> While the Pathfinder Society makes its home in the [[Grand Lodge]] of [[Absalom]], its membership comes from and travels to all corners of the known world. Outside the [[Inner Sea region]], one of the highest concentrations of [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] is on the continent of Tian Xia, and specifically in the metropolitan city of [[Goka]]. Most Tian Pathfinders operate independently of their brethren in Absalom, but occasionally agents cross the [[Crown of the World]], make the treacherous naval voyage south around [[Casmaron]], or simply teleport between the two hubs of activity.


## Goals: Spread the Wisdom of Tian Xia in the Inner Sea

> The Lantern Lodge represents Tian interests in the Inner Sea region, ensuring that Pathfinder Society agents far to the east of the [[Decemvirate]]'s direct view are considered in organization-wide affairs. It also seeks to expand the Dragon Empires' cultural reach and acquire, trade, or return [[Artifact|artifacts]].


## Retirement

> Amara dissolved the Lantern Lodge faction in [[4713 AR]] to assume leadership of an expanded [[Lantern Lodge]] in Goka. However, the Absalom lodge remained open as an affiliate of the main Goka lodge, and continues to host Pathfinders from Tian Xia and facilitate exchanges with those in the Inner Sea region.
