> A **consul** is a member of the government of [[Andoran]] chosen directly by the [[Supreme Elect]] to advise him or her on military matters. In this way they are similar to members of the [[Demarchy Assembly]], who advise the Supreme Elect on finance, foreign affairs, justice, trade, commerce, and the treasury. The total number of consuls currently stands at 30, but it is not known whether this is required by government, or is simply the current total under [[Codwin I]]. Consuls are also appointed to the [[People's Council|Peoples Council]]. Many (if not all) of the consuls have an office in the [[Citadel of the Supreme Elect]] in [[Almas]].
