> **Seekers Usanji** are a multi-faith group that focuses on hunting down and destroying the deadly [[Asura|asura]]. The Seekers Usanji are based in [[Vudra]] as it unfortunately is a haven for the god-hating asura. With its [[Vudran pantheon|thousand deities]], the Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra are rife with the religious ruins that asuras favour for making their lairs in. The asura are scattered across the entire length and breadth of Vudra, so the Seekers Usanji have to maintain a large network of contacts and informants. They even often have to rely on outside [[Adventurer|adventurers]] to help them deal with the [[Unholy|unholy]] asura threat.
