> The **Johud** are a clan of [[Fiendish creature|fiendish]] [[Marsh giant|marsh giants]] who rule the abandoned city of [[Dyinglight]] in the [[Frostmire]] region of the [[Worldwound]]. They are devout (if somewhat primitive) worshipers of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Kostchtchie]], and are led by their high priest, [[Glungur]].


## History

> A clan of marsh giants dwelled for eons in the [[Frostmire Fen]], a large wetland in the northwestern part of [[Sarkoris]]. Although they were hunted by the local [[Kellid]] [[Human|humans]], the giant population could never be eradicated completely. When the [[Worldwound]] opened in [[4606 AR]] releasing hordes of [[Demon|demons]], the humans abandoned the nearby city of [[Dyinglight]], leaving many of their belongings behind. Despite this tempting target, the giants of the Fen did not approach the city, fearing it was another human trick. A small group of [[Frost giant|frost giants]] under the leadership of the visionary [[Bjorvesh|Jarl Bjorvesh]] entered Sarkoris, lured there by the demonic incursion, and quickly took the city. When the marsh giants saw this, they realized that the humans were truly gone for good, and descended upon Dyinglight, overwhelming the frost giants with their greater numbers. When Jarl Bjorvesh fell, he immediately rose from the dead, congratulating the marsh giants on their victory, but informing them that they now had to establish a giant kingdom there in honor of [[Kostchtchie]]. They immediately dedicated themselves to the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] and have claimed the city every since. Within a generation, the marsh giants began seeing [[Fiendish|fiendish]] deformities in their offspring, and soon the entire population was wholly tainted, remembering their previous existence only as legend.
