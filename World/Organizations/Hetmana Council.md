> The **Hetmana Council** is the governing body of the [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] city of [[Dwimovel]] in the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Sekamina]]. It is composed of three dozen elected clan leaders, or hetmen, who each represent one of the many habitat caverns in the city. The Hetmana Council handles the city's domestic issues, leaving command of the military to an elected general (currently [[Szartik Bwevenderal]]). The council communicates its decisions to the scattered caverns of Dwimovel via allied [[Earth elemental|earth elementals]] and [[Xorn|xorn]].
