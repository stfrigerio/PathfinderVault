> Throughout its early history, the [[Taldor|Empire of Taldor]] repeatedly launched expansionist military campaigns designed to increase its territory and wealth. These **Armies of Exploration** met with variable success, but at its height, Taldor controlled territories now belonging to [[Galt]], [[Andoran]], [[Isger]], [[Molthune]], [[Nirmathas]], [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], and [[Cheliax]]. Not only did these colonies bring the empire untold wealth, but they spread Taldan culture and the [[Human languages of GolarionCommon Taldane|Taldane]] language throughout the [[Inner Sea region]]. Below is a short list of the best-remembered of these campaigns.



## First Army of Exploration

> The First Army of Exploration, led by the famous [[Porthmos person|General Porthmos]], destroyed [[Goroth Lodge]] in the [[Verduran Forest]] in [[37 AR]] and charted the [[Sellen River]] as far as [[Sevenarches]].


## Second Army of Exploration

> The Second Army of Exploration built upon the successes of the First and explored the regions north of [[Lake Encarthan]] in [[499 AR]], making it all the way to the [[Orc|orcs]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. Some efforts were made to explore portions of what is now known as [[Numeria]], [[Nirmathas]], and [[Molthune]], but made little progress due to hostile locals and dwindling supplies.


## Third Army of Exploration

> [[Coren|General Coren]] led the Third Army of Exploration into western [[Avistan]], where he founded the city of [[Corentyn]] in [[1520 AR]] in order to secure the passage to and from the [[Inner Sea]], and created a massive defensive earthwork. Near the opposite side of the empire, the Third Army built the military outpost of [[Gensmaren]] in what is now [[Razmiran]]. During its tenure, the Third Army of Exploration secured the entire northern coast of the Inner Sea for the Empire of Taldor, making it that nation's greatest expansionist endeavor; no Army of Exploration before or after ever matched its successes. One of the heroes remembered from this army is Draconos the Flametongue, a Taldan knight famed for his perseverance to find peaceful solutions, yet having overwhelming prowess with his flaming [[Whip|whip]] to defeat any stubborn enemies.
> Carmyn e'Brothasa served as the chronicler of the Third Army's exploits in the north.


## Fourth Army of Exploration

> The Fourth Army of Exploration surveyed and staked a claim to the lands that would eventually be Andoran in [[1683 AR]], and made a brief attempt into the [[Five Kings Mountains]]. A soldier named [[Galitian Maramaxus]] greatly distinguished himself while serving in its ranks.


## Fifth Army of Exploration

> The Fifth Army of Exploration continued the work of the First Army of Exploration, and pushed north through the present-day [[River Kingdoms]] (reaching the western border of [[Iobaria]] in [[2009 AR]]). It then turned back and mapped the many branches of the Sellen River in [[2014 AR]]. They used a massive, magical siege engine named the [[Worldbreaker]] during this campaign, which was turned into a monument and placed on [[Worldbreaker Hill]] in [[Oppara]] after it was decommissioned.
> A veteran of this war named [[Maldar Tymon]] founded the city-state of [[Tymon]] in what is now the [[River Kingdoms]] in [[2021 AR]]. Taldor granted him this land after many years of distinguished service to the Empire.


## Sixth Army of Exploration

> 
The Sixth Army holds the ignoble reputation of having lost the enormous, magical siege engine Worldbreaker (*[[Fifth Army of Exploration|see above]]*) to the forces of the [[Gorilla King]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] in [[2089 AR]], after pulling it from its foundation in Oppara. The Sixth Army, which was composed of thousands of militiamen conscripted from the province of [[Andoran]] in [[2080 AR]], entered the Expanse from the east, via the [[Ndele Gap]] in [[Nex]]. They only made it as far as the ruined city of [[Nagisa]] before they were ambushed by the Gorilla King's forces and massacred. The general at this time was [[Erestos Marburran]]. It is rumored that the Army wished to penetrate all the way to [[Garund]]'s western coast, and thereby conquer all the lands surrounding the [[Inner Sea]]. Taldor was never able to fully recover from this great defeat.


## Seventh Army of Exploration

> In [[2133 AR]] the Seventh Army of Exploration pacified the [[Kellid]] tribes of [[Isger]] between the [[Menador Mountains|Menador]] and [[Five Kings Mountains]] in a desire to control trade between [[Druma]] and the nations along the [[Inner Sea]]. This resulted in the establishment of the Taldan protectorate of Isger, named after the defeated tribes. Although successful, the victory was sorely won and the Taldan leadership was regarded with disdain for their brutal commands.


## Eighth Army of Exploration

> The last Army of Exploration was launched in [[4606 AR]] before the death of [[Aroden]] sewed chaos throughout the world. Desperate to revitalize the nation of Taldor, General Orphyrea Amandar set sail in the hopes of finding a new land to rule far from home. Despite being battered by tremendous storms mere months after leaving port, Amanandar weathered the death of Aroden and arrived in northern [[Shenmen]] in [[Tian Xia]].
> After she and her army disembarked at the city of [[Kamikobu]] in [[4608 AR]], they defeated a dozen bandit warlords and took control of the region, renaming the city [[New Oppara]].
