> The **Patrons** are the group of individuals who direct the various activities of the [[Aspis Consortium]] throughout the [[Inner Sea region]]. They prefer to surround themselves with an air of mystery, leading some to believe that the Aspis are run by dark cultists or even alien beings. The truth is much more benign: they consist of two executives, [[A X Adrius]] and [[Jaydis Milon Malddis IV]], who are the eldest sons of two of the Consortium's original founders, and the eight member board of directors (and majority shareholders) of the corporation.



## Business practices

> The Patrons prefer to disguise their activities and those of the Aspis Consortium, and few outside of their elite circle are aware of all or even most of the corporation's myriad dealings. This not only gives them an advantage of their competitors, but allows them to distance themselves from past scandals. In these instances, past indiscretions are blamed on retired Patrons and openly condemned, with the public none the wiser as to who was really responsible.


## Known Patrons

> - A. X. Adrius: The icy face of the Aspis Consortium
> - Jaydis Milon Malddis IV: Rarely seen dilettante and playboy
> - Arvemis the Benighted
> - Muriel Azphitra
> - Kara Thristlecauldron

## Associates

> The Patrons rely on the knowledge and skills of several experts. These include the Consortium's spy mistress [[Cirildimina Alasbhallas]], their fleet master [[Pairo Gavhaul|Lord Pairo Gavhaul]], the chief of headquarters security [[Khayn|Mr Khayn]], and the obsessive chief of the mysterious [[Conference Z]] operation, [[Tantis Mais|Professor Tantis Mais]].
