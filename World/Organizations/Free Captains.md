> **Free Captains** are leaders among the [[Shackles Pirates]]. Anyone can declare themselves a Free Captain so long as they possess a ship and some control the various ports of the [[Shackles]] and have a number of other Free Captains serving under them, but the most powerful of all comprise the [[Shackles]] ruling body: the [[Pirate Council]].
> While Free Captains have little affection for one anotherâ€”much less any trustâ€”nearly all of them respect and support each other as a group when called upon by the Pirate Council or its leader, the [[Hurricane King]].

 A half-elf free captain.
> Each year since [[4677 AR]], independent Free Captains can attempt to increase their status by entering the [[Free Captains' Regatta|Free Captains Regatta]]. The winner gains a seat on the Pirate Council, lordship of an island, and a hefty purse.


## History

> The Free Captains have protected rebellious [[Sargava]] against [[House Thrune]] and the [[Chelish Navy]] since [[4640 AR]], when they started taking annual tribute from [[Grallus|Baron Grallus]]. This includes victories by the Free Captains in [[4643 AR]] and [[4660 AR]]. While most Free Captains abide by the treaty, the dissenters of [[Firegrass Isle]] refused to obey it, creating a rift between them and the Pirate Council.
> The Free Captains united under the Hurricane King in [[4674 AR]] to harass shipping north of the Shackles, and the first Free Captains' Regatta was held three years later. Their recent success spurred the so-called **Glorious Age of the Free Captains** that began in [[4681 AR]] and represents the unprecedented era of prosperity that the Free Captains currently enjoy.
