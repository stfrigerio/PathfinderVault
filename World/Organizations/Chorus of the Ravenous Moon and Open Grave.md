> The **Chorus of the Ravenous Moon and Open Grave** is a [[Protean|protean]] chorus of nine [[Keketar|keketars]] whose sole aim is feeding the [[Soul|souls]] held in [[Pharasma's Spire|Pharasmas Spire]] to the apocalyptic god [[Groetus]]. The chorus's members believe that by feeding these souls to Groetus they will completely destroy [[Axis]], the city of [[Law|perfect law]], thus destroying the balance of all the [[Outer plane|outer planes]] and plunging the [[Multiverse|multiverse]] into beautiful [[Chaos|chaos]]. The incredibly destructive goals of the Chorus of the Ravenous Moon and Open Grave makes them the enemy of almost every lawful and [[Good|good]] [[Deity|deity]] in existence and the enemy of [[Pharasma]] herself. Curiously, this group's radical plan has not impacted Pharasma's relationship with any of the rest of the protean species or the [[Protean lord|protean lord]] known as [[Ssila'meshnik|Ssilameshnik the Colorless Lord]].
