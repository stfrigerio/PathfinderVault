> The **Uprooters** are elite [[Elf|elven]] [[Hunter|hunters]] leading offensives against [[Treerazer]] and other [[Demon|demons]] in the [[Tanglebriar]]. An Uprooter scout who survived a campaign to the [[Worldwound]] settled in [[Mendev]] to teach the band's advanced demon-hunting skills to other races.
