> The **Pirate Pact** is the name given to the protection racket established on a part of the [[Sellen River]] by [[Morgan the White]].
> It operates in the region of the [[River Kingdoms]] currently known as the [[Protectorate of the Black Marquis]], and is overseen by the Black Marquis, [[Urdal Bazzak]]. The Protectorate controls a 30 mile stretch of the river, and river traffic is expected to stop in the capital of [[Deadbridge]] to pay a toll. Those that evade the toll are attacked by river pirates.
> Anyone willing to work may become part of the Pact, and share in the risks and rewards of the protection racket. However, candidates must undergo a six month probation period working as a deckhand on one of the pirate vessels.
> The Protectorate abides by the [[River Freedoms]], so vessels flying the flags of the other River Kingdoms are exempt from the toll. Agreements have been made with [[Numeria]], [[Brevoy]] and [[Mendev]], and their vessels pay a lower toll in the interests of "neighbourly goodwill". The Numerians enjoy a particularly good deal, as their military support was the main reason Urdal Bazzak was able to become Marquis.
