> The **Guild of Liars** is an organization of storytellers, con men, actors, and other conversational acrobats, who meet every five years at the [[House of Lies]] in [[Nidal|Nidals]] [[Uskwood]] to exchange stories, quips, tall tales, and other feats of verbal legerdemain. The member judged to be the most convincing liar is awarded the coveted title of "truth maker", and is given access to the House of Lies' extensive cabinet of curiosities.
