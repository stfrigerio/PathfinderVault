> The **Witchmarket** is a small company of [[Fey|fey]] merchants and scoundrels from the [[First World]] who travel to [[Golarion]] through gaps and [[Portal|portals]] between the [[Plane|planes]] to sell their wares to the unwary and the desperate.
> They sell all kinds of weird and wonderful itemsâ€”from [[Potion|love potions]] and magic beans, to replicas of long lost items created by reading the buyer's mind. Their prices are equally strangeâ€”a year of life, a kiss, a middle name, childhood memoriesâ€”and at first the buyer may feel he has got quite a bargain.
