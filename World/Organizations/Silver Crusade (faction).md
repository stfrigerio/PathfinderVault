> The **Silver Crusade faction** within the [[Pathfinder Society]] represents [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] who want to apply the Society's resources toward making the world a better place. Although made defunct due to recent reforms by the Society, the Radiant Oath arose as it's spiritual successor within the organisation.


## Background

> When the existence of so many factions within the Pathfinder Society began to become apparent, many were dismayed, especially those who took umbrage at the Society's resources being used for ethically questionable purposes or personal gain. Unable to eliminate such elements as the [[Shadow Lodge faction|Shadow Lodge]] from the ranks of the organization, an influential group of Pathfinder [[Cleric|clerics]], [[Paladin|paladins]], and servants of [[CategoryDeities by alignment|good-aligned deities]] banded together to form their own factionâ€”the Silver Crusadeâ€”as an answer to these undesirable offshoots of the Society.


## Goals: Use the Society for Good

> While a crusade in name only, the Silver Crusade models itself after the staunchly good [[Silver dragon|silver dragon]], making a valiant effort to use the Society's influence, reach, and resources to do good throughout the Inner Sea region and beyond. Crusaders strive to push the Society toward destroying the forces of evil and defending the weak, in part by identifying and removing elements of greed and abusive power from the Society itself.
