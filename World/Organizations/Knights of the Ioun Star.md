> At the height of [[Azlant|Imperial Azlant]], the **Knights of the Ioun Star** was a shining order of armored [[Magus|magi]] who served the throne.


## Structure

> The sect of the [[Knights of the Western Star]] served the emperor and the empire's Throne of Glass, while the sect of the [[Knights of the Eastern Star]] searched the lands beyond the empire's borders for secret lore.
> Chapters of the Knights of the Ioun Star are known as *almorains*, an [[Azlanti language|Azlanti]] term akin to "family" or "alliance".


## After Earthfall

> The few Knights of the Western Star who survived the [[Earthfall]] eventually came to serve the living [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]], while the Knights of the Eastern Star never believed that Aroden was truly the Last Azlanti. When Aroden died, the Knights of the Western Star faded from history but the Knights of the Eastern Star have remained scattered throughout [[Avistan]] and beyond, since [[Earthfall]], ever searching for secret lore and the new ruler who would restore the glory of Azlant.
> The strongest faction of the Knights of the Eastern Star, known as the [[Apotheosis Almorain]], is centered in [[Oppara]].
