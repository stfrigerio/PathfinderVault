> The **Steel Eaters** are a cult of tribeless and half-mad [[Orc|orc]] smiths and engineers. They occupy the [[Foundry]] in the [[Hold of Belkzen]], an ancient fortress constructed centuries ago in the eastern [[Kodar Mountains]] at the height of [[Dwarf|dwarven]] power on the surface of [[Golarion]].
> Steel Eaters use the ancient dwarven metalworks to manufacture new orc arms and siege weapons. The other orc tribes have learned the lesson that to try to get the Foundry by force is very risky. Steel Eaters produce the best weapons in the region and sell them to all tribes without bias, meaning that the tribe who angers the cult will come to major disadvantage.
