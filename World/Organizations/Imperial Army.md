> The **Imperial Army**, also known as the **Molthuni Army**, is the main military force of [[Molthune]]. Molthuni culture centers around the army due to the nation's expansionist goals and war with [[Nirmathas]]. Those born into the laborer caste can attain full citizenship by serving five years in the Imperial Army, and immigrants are granted land in exchange for military service. Due to its zeal for conquest, the army even accepts monstrous races, including [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblins]], [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]], [[Lycanthrope|lycanthropes]], and [[Naga|nagas]].



## Leadership

> The leaders of the Imperial Army are the nine [[General Lords]], who also rule as Molthune's civil leaders. At the head of the General Lords is the Imperial Governor, currently [[Markwin Teldas]], who also holds the title and role of High Commander of the Molthuni Imperial Army. The army's command point is the [[Imperial Castle]] in [[Canorate]].


## Uniform and heraldry

> Most troops are trained with standardized [[Weapon|weapons]] and uniforms and trained in the importance of discipline and respect for authority. The uniform consists of a red cape over a white tabard surmounting some form of [[Armour|armour]].


### Heraldry

> Regular soldiers display the [[Heraldry|heraldry]] of the Imperial Army: a small, red [[Dragon|dragon]] holding a larger, purple-coloured sword.


## Units of the Imperial Army

> The more-elite troops of the Imperial Army are usually stationed at [[Fort Ramgate]] where they can most effectively strike at Nirmathi skirmishers who harass the mutual border. Rumours have begun to circulate that the Molthuni Army has trained their lycanthrope units in forest warfare, specifically for the purpose of hunting down Nirmathi [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]].
