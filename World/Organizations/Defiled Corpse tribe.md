> The **Defiled Corpse tribe** is one of the most dangerous [[Orc|orc]] tribes in the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. They revere [[Zon-Kuthon]] and their appearance is horrific. They delight in torturing captives but they often torture themselves, as a sign of endurance and devotion. The tribe is feared and reviled even by the other orc tribes.
> A shaman of the Defiled Corpse tribe, called [[Ungukk Fleshdredge]], created a terrible [[Flesh golem|flesh golem]] called the [[Carcass-Man of Belkzen]].
