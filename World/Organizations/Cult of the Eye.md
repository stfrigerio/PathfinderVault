> The **Cult of the Eye** is a dark and weird religion of the [[Shackles]] that worships the [[Eye of Abendego]], the permanent hurricane that appeared following the death of [[Aroden]], as a new [[Deity|deity]] called the **Deluged God**.


## Worship

> The Cult of the Eye is led by the high priest [[Chessadarde|Father Chessadarde]], who claims his divine visions from the Deluged God began after he sailed into the heart of the shattered continent of [[Azlant]] to the west. Its practices and doctrines are kept secret.
> According to their faith, the Eye of Abendego heralds the birth of a new deity known as the Deluged God, and once emerged, it will flood all land on [[Golarion]]. The cult performs sacrifices â€” of [[Animal|animals]], and according to rumors of other beings as well â€” to persuade the Deluged God to leave a home for his faithful in order to prepare the world for its new life. A number of mysterious disappearances of beggars and drunks in [[Drenchport]] are blamed on the cult, which has at least seven shrines to the Deluged God in shadier parts of the city.
> The cult's congregation numbers around 100, including priests who spread its message from small [[Ship|ships]] that sail the Shackles. The cult expects each worshiper to make at least one pilgrimage to the [[Isle of Consummations]] in the Shackles, northwest of [[Tempest Cay]]. While the temples of [[Besmara]] and [[Gozreh]] monitor it out of suspicions about its goals, the cult have won few converts beyond Tempest Cay. However, it is sometimes whispered that the [[Master of the Gales]] is a member of this cult.
