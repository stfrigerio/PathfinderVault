*The term diabolism is sometimes used to describe the worship of [[Asmodeus]] and his [[Archdevil|archdevils]].*
> **Diabolism** is a [[Philosophy|philosophy]] interested in understanding, serving, and emulating the organizational structures of [[Hell]]. Diabolists do not venerate Asmodeus or his archdevils in particular, preferring to come to a greater understanding of the hierarchies, structures, and philosophies that are the underpinnings of their interactions. As such, this ideology does not grant its adherents [[Divine magic|divine power]], although devotees of infernal powers often arise from such cults, making the philosophy something of a stepping stone to infernal worship.
> Diabolists believe that Hell is the most ordered and rational society in the [[Great Beyond]] and wish to transform themselves and their surroundings to model this perfect structure. They admire hierarchical systems of power, the virtue of strong leadership, the understanding that pleasure cannot exist without pain and suffering, the suppression of free will, and the value of [[Slavery|slavery]]. Diabolists understand the necessity of opposing forces, andâ€”more often than notâ€”seek to respect the powers that govern one of the best established hierarchies of [[Law|lawful]] order in all the [[Plane|planes]]. Most do not see these beliefs as [[Evil|evil]], simply as a necessity to maintaining functional order.


## Diabolism on Golarion

> Unsurprisingly, diabolism is most popular in the infernally tainted nations of [[Cheliax]] and its colony of [[Isger]], where its admirers can watch its basic tenets being translated into practical statecraft. Its popularity is greatest among the nation's ruling families, with the common people generally only paying it lip service.
