> The **Greenskin Stalkers** are a gang of [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|rangers]] and [[Slayer|slayers]] obsessed with killing all [[Goblinoid|goblinoid]] creatures. Originally formed in [[Isger]] during the [[Goblinblood Wars]], the Stalkers' obsession leads many to disturbingly immerse themselves in the thoughts and acts of [[Goblin|goblins]] in order to better track and kill them, even if it leads to their own deaths.
> While inspired by Isger's long-settled signature conflict, the group continues to recruit new members, spreading its influence into the [[River Kingdoms]] and [[Varisia]].
