> The faith of the [[Ascended|ascended]] [[Deity|god]] [[Norgorber]] is divided into four distinct branches, each overseeing one aspect of the deity's portfolio. Three are fairly well-knownâ€”the Reaper of Reputation (secrets), the Gray Master (thieves), and Blackfingers ([[Poison|poison]]). The fourth, however, is not readily admittedâ€”that which attracts the most extreme and murderously insane, who commit atrocities as acts of worship to Father Skinsaw. The followers of this cult are known as the **Skinsaw Men**. The **Skinsaw Cult** is a centuries-old organization originating in [[Vyre]], [[Cheliax]]. At least one branch of the cult is believed to be active in [[Magnimar]], known as the [[Brotherhood of the Seven]].
