> **Dottari** is the name given to city guards in [[Cheliax]]. The term appears to be loosely equivalent to the [[Taldane|Common]] word "wardens".

## Structure

> Dottari are organized into several ranks to form a hierarchical command structure. For instance, the Westcrown Dottari and Kintargo Dottari follow this general structure:

Duxotar or Duxotas
This officer, also known as the "high warden", commands a city's dottari. A city has only one duxotas or duxotar.
Durotas
Also known as "rank wardens", these officers command dottari across a city rego (region) and report directly to the duxotas or duxotar. The plural of durotas is "durotasi".
Major
These officers report to their rego's durotasi. Regos often have multiple majors.
Captain
These officers report to majors and oversee multiple squads of common dottari.
Lieutenants
These officers lead individual squads of common dottari.
Soldiers
Sometimes called "common dottari" or simply "dottari", soldiers act in squads overseen by lieutenants.
> The dottari of specific city sectors often have a modified designation. For instance, the dottari of Westcrown's canals and waterways are known as "condottari" (canal wardens), while those who patrol its ruins are known as "rundottari" (ruin wardens).
