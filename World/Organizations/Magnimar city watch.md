> Part of the military of [[Magnimar]], the **Magnimar City Watch** is tasked with patrolling the city's streets and protecting its walls. Composed primarily of 400 trained archers, the city watch can rally upwards of 900 additional forces within an hour.
> The watch focuses its efforts on the city's major thoroughfares as well as neighborhoods with an extensive government presence. The city watch also maintains patrols along the [[Yondabakari Road]] and the [[Lost Coast Road]].
> The city watch puts on monthly mock gladiatorial battles to help raise funds for the government and build the citizenry's loyalty toward the watch. Some guards have garnered small fan bases from their performances in these events.
