> The **Wardens of the Eye** were a small group of adventurers active in the late 46th and early 47th century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]]. They were led by a [[Paladin|paladin]] of [[Aroden]] named [[Alcaydian Indros]], and were instrumental in the founding of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]]. They are still remembered and revered in that city, where countless statues of them can be found.


## History

> The Wardens of the Eye first traveled to the mouth of the [[Yondabakari River]] in [[4584 AR]]. There they discovered the mighty [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] bridge known as the [[Irespan]] and defeated a mighty [[Vydrarch|vydrarch]] in the waters of the [[Varisian Gulf]]. They briefly disbanded in [[4606 AR]] when their leader, Alcaydian Indros, had a crisis of faith caused by the passing of his patron deity. They soon helped him rededicate himself to the [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lords]], and took on the cause of leading thousands of [[Korvosa|Korvosan]] residents, dissatisfied with the city's growing [[Hell|infernal]] influence, westward to find a new home. They settled the refugees at the sight of their defeat of the vydrarch, founding the city of Magnimar.
