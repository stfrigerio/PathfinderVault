> The librarians of the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] city of [[Tar-Kazmukh]] in the [[Five Kings Mountains]] are called **Blue Warders**. Tar-Kazmukh is famous for its rather impressive library which hold the accumulated arcane lore of the dwarven race and draws dwarven [[Wizard|wizards]] from all over the region, even distant [[Janderhoff]], but also [[Human|human]] and [[Elf|elf]] visitors.
> Each Blue Warder is tattooed in counter-sigils that permit passage through the magical defenses of the library. The number and complexity of a Blue Warder's tattoos is increased with age and responsibility. The most highly ranked librarians have access to ever-deeper chambers where secret collections are stored. The Warders also act as escorts for visitors, guiding them through the maze of library's tunnels and chambers. They are generally friendly to visitors who come in peace and a polite request, however they reserve the right to deny access to anyone they see as enemy.
