> The **Children of the Upper Reach** are an [[Iomedae|Iomedaean]] order of [[Monk|monks]] who have been developing the martial art [[Melekatha]], an unarmed [[Combat style|combat style]] consisting of dodges, holds, and strikes designed to turn the energy of the attacker back on themselves. The art has been developed to combat the [[Hamatulatsu]] style of the [[Sisters of the Golden Erinyes]] of [[Isger]], but the abbess Helsan Torvill still has not sent out a ritual challenge to determine which art is stronger.
