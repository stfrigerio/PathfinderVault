> **House Jeggare** is an ancient noble house found across the entire extent of [[Avistan]], although centered in [[Cheliax]]. Extremely wealthy, it joined [[House Thrune]] and other allies in building the Qatada Nessudiddia in [[Westcrown]] between [[4639 AR]] and [[4677 AR]].
> The branch of House Jeggare in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]] descends from a nephew of the famous philanthropist [[Montlarion Jeggare]]. It controls the second-largest share of dock space in Korvosa, allowing the family to generate an enormous income through its brisk trade. Nearly a quarter of the city's privately held assets are controlled by the family, making it not only a powerful and influential noble house but also the wealthiest. House Jeggare survives the sometimes cut-throat politics of Korvosa by keeping a line of credit open for the monarch and other noble families, and by acting as the chief financial backer of both the [[Korvosan Guard]] and the [[Sable Company]].
