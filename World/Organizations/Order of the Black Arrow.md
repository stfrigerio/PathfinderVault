> The **Order of the Black Arrow**, or sometimes the **Order of the Black Arrows**, is an organization of [[Giant|giant]] hunters in [[Varisia]]. It was created decades ago to patrol the [[Storval Rise]] and prevent any giant incursions from spreading beyond the [[Storval Plateau]]. It often recruits criminals who are given the choice between serving in the Black Arrows and harsh punishment. In any case the constant training and the dangers they face have made the Black Arrows loyal to their order. The order counts from a few loyal members to several dozen depending on the circumstances.
> The commanding officer at Fort Rannick [[Jakardros Sovark]] is a member of the Order of the Black Arrows.
