> The **Order of the Glyph** is an unofficial [[Hellknights]] order founded by [[House Thrune]] to serve in their propaganda campaign.


## History

> The Order of the Glyph was created by House Thrune shortly after they seized control of [[Cheliax]], without the knowledge or authorisation of any other Hellknight order. As the newly-founded [[Imperial Ministry of Historical Accuracy]] revised Cheliax's history, House Thrune secreted away actual historical records to the Archive of Redacted Histories and entrusted them to a cult of [[Geryon]], who became the first members of the Order of the Glyph. The Order of the Glyph has protected both Cheliax's real history and House Thrune's lies since then.


## Members

> The Order of the Glyph counts fewer than 30 members today, most of them [[Lawful evil|lawfully evil]] [[Alignment|aligned]]. Roughly half are stationed in the Archive of Redacted Histories, while the rest guard secret libraries in [[Egorian]] and [[Westcrown]]. The order's rigid disciplines, religious obsessions, and elitist attitudes have conditioned its members to hide their status from outsiders. To this end, members rarely wear their [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] and avoid other Hellknights, to the point that they are willing to go to their graves to keep the existence of a Thrune Hellknight order a secret, without exactly understanding why. Although nominally servants of House Thrune, the Order of the Glyph follows its own code, and its members will never agree to destroy the documents under their charge.
> Despite being an unofficial Hellknight order, members of the Order of the Glyph continue to follow the Hellknights' strictures, interwoven with the teachings of [[Archdevil|archdevils]] (particularly Geryon), and have access to all skills normally available only to true Hellknights.
