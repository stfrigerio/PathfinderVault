> **House Lebeda** is a noble family of the [[Avistan|Avistani]] nation of [[Brevoy]]. Its central holdings are located southwest of [[Lake Reykal]] in [[Rostland]], controlling the plains and significant portions of the lake's shipping. They are considered to be the Brevic noble family that epitomizes Rostland, having significant [[Taldan]] blood, an appreciation for fine things, and a love of sword fighting.



## Castle

> Their ancestral fortress, [[Silverhall]], overlooks [[Lake Reykal]] and controls the shipping on the lake, and their business of being brokers and merchants linking the north and south of Brevoy has made them rich.


## Leadership

> House Lebeda is currently led by [[Lander Lebeda|Lord Lander Lebeda]], who recently took over from his mother, [[Sarrona Lebeda|Dame Sarrona Lebeda]] who ruled it as regent until Lander came of age. Her oldest child, [[Elanna Lebeda|Elanna]], is the house's representative in [[New Stetven]].


## Heraldry

> The family's crest is a swan on water with the sun on the horizon. Depending on how the house fares, the people say the sun is either rising or setting; currently most people say the sun is rising. The family motto is "Success through Grace."


## Recent History

> A prospective alliance between [[House Surtova]] and House Lebeda that would have symbolically united Rostland (Elanna Lebeda) and Issia ([[Noleski Surtova|King Noleski Surtova]]) and brought some much needed stability to fractured Brevoy, fell apart in [[4718 AR]] when the king's sister, [[Natala Surtova]], accused Lord Lander Lebeda of treason. Lord Lander disappeared soon thereafter, leaving the would-be bride to return home in humiliation. Since Lord Lander had been accused of harboring revolutionary sentiments numerous times during his youth, most of the Brevic nobility believed the Surtovan accusations. The notable exception were members of [[House Orlovsky]], who claimed that the facts supporting the purported treason were contradictory and unclear, and countered that this was most likely Surtovan propaganda. This has caused a significant fracture between the houses of Surtova and Orlovsky, one that threatens to escalate into armed confrontation.
