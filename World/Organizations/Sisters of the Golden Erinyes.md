> Also known as the **Devil Nuns**, the **Sisters of the Golden Erinyes** are among the most well known of the monastic orders in [[Isger]] fostered by the [[Church of Asmodeus]] in the aftermath of the [[Goblinblood Wars]]. One of their primary missions is to take in children left orphaned by the wars, and raise them as worshipers of [[Asmodeus]]. Using [[Unholy water|unholy water]], the sisterhood baptizes rescued youths and drills them in the basics of infernal politics and [[Philosophy|philosophies]]. The training is eventually extended to exotic martial arts that are difficult to master, such as learning to tear [[Armour|armour]] apart with just bare hands, and gaining expertise with rare [[Weapon|weapons]], such as the seven-branched sword. Upon reaching adulthood, female orphans may be allowed to join the Order. Many male orphans seek to become priests of Asmodeus or [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]].


## History of the Sisterhood

> The Sisters of the Golden Erinyes is a branch of the original Sisterhood of Eiseth, a convent of female monks who hoped to become [[Erinyes|erinyes]] after their deaths. The Sisterhood worshiped [[Eiseth]], the first erinys. Prior to the death of the god [[Aroden]], the sisterhood operated under cover, typically hiding their convents amongst mausoleums or funeral houses. Following Aroden's death, the sisterhood expanded in some areas and contracted in others. It was in Isger that the Sisterhood had its greatest success, eventually re-branding itself in Isger as the Sisters of the Golden Erinyes.


## Hamatulatsu

> The sisters practice a vicious [[Fighting style|fighting style]] known as [[Hamatulatsu]], inspired by the combat prowess of the [[Barbed devil|barbed devil]]. The aim of the style is not necessarily to kill but to inflict painful wounds that cripple and scar opponents with memorable pain.
