> The **Al'Chorhaiv** tribe of fearless [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] lives in the open with no centralized lair or specific defenses. They recognize no territory and roam anywhere in the [[Brazen Peaks]] they can find meat. Their chieftain is Ahrikvask, a deceptive murderess and master of [[Scorpion|scorpions]]. Isvhag, a large monstrous scorpion, travels alongside the chieftain. 
> Another notable member of the tribe is [[Vamaag]], the former sacred mother in the service of [[Lamashtu]] and a silent opponent of the chieftain. Emissaries of the [[Carrion King]] often come to the Al'Chorhaiv seeking news of the surrounding lands, [[Poison|poisons]], and their skills as archers and assassins.
