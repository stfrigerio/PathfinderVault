![[Azaersi.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 General Azaersi, leader of the Ironfang Legion.
> The **Ironfang Legion** is a former mercenary legion that fought on behalf of the [[Molthuni Army]], then called the **Ironfangs**. Founded and led by [[Azaersi]], a survivor of the [[Goblinblood Wars]], the Legion no longer fights for money, but rather is working to conquer southern [[Nirmathas]] in order to form a [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]] nation in [[Avistan]], much like [[Kaoling]] in [[Tian Xia]]. [[Alchemist|Alchemists]] are celebrated in the Ironfang Legion unlike other [[Arcane magic|arcane magic users]]. Alchemists also serve as the Legion's main form of [[Healing|healing]]. The Ironfang Legion employs beastmasters who train [[Wolf|wolves]], [[Bear|bears]], [[Boar|boars]], giant [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Frog|frogs]], insects, and [[Worg|worgs]].



## History

> The Legion was founded by Azaersi in the [[Shrikewood]]. When her group, mostly veterans of the Goblinblood Wars or hobgoblin orphans of the same, defeated a Molthuni Army regiment, the [[General Lords]] approached Azaersi and hired the group to pillage [[Nirmathas]], though the Legion acted without official sanction from [[Molthune]]. The Ironfang Legion gained notoriety after they massacred [[Fort Ramgate]], and shortly thereafter, they fell off the map. Secretly, the Ironfang Legion stole the [[Artifact|artifact]], the *[[Onyx Key]]*, to help them deploy troops quickly on hit-and-run missions.


## Hierarchy

> Aligning with the strict organization of hobgoblin societies, the Ironfang Legion has a rigid structure composed of six ranks:

General
Azaersi is the founder and commander-in-chief of the Ironfang Legion.
Commanders
The Ironfang Legion has four commanders who are directly below Azaersi in power. They are the commander of the army, [[Kraelos]]; the coordinator for specialist missions, Taurgreth; the religious leader, [[Azlowe]]; and Azaersi's personal and magical advisor, Zanathura.
Lieutenants
Given wide discretion, lieutenants lead large groups of soldiers to carry out specific strategic goals.
Specialists
Somewhat outside the standard hierarchy, the specialists might report to a lieutenant, a commander, or even General Azaersi herself, depending on the scope of their mission.
Sergeants
These lead small groups of soldiers to achieve discrete and concrete tactical goals.
Troopers
The backbone of the army, troopers are usually hobgoblins, though there are [[Bugbear|bugbears]], worgs, and [[Kobold|kobolds]] among others in the troops.

## Heraldry

> The [[Heraldry|arms]] of the Ironfang Legion show a red field split with a thick, vertical, central black or dark brown band. The central band is surmounted by a [[Dagger|dagger]]. On the red band to the left, are three small, four-pointed [[Star|stars]] lying one above the other in a vertical line; on the red band to the right, is a single, large, four-pointed star.
