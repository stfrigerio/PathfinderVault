> The **Wasp Queens** are an elite society of female [[Elves|elves]] and [[Half-elves|half-elves]], who are also [[Rogue|thieves]]. They follow the teachings of [[Calistria]] related to trickery and revenge. They are for hire for any number of activities especially the ones that are considered impossible. The Wasp Queens have broken into the most secure vaults of [[Abadar|Abadars]] temples, have lifted huge amounts of [[Currency|coin]] from the banks of [[Absalom]], and are even said to have stolen the scepter of Queen [[Abrogail Thrune II|Abrogail]] of [[Cheliax]] herself and sold it back to her. They travel all across [[Avistan]], always eventually returning to [[Kyonin]]. Their commander is Arala Insifaal.
