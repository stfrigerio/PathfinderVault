## Previous Revolutionary Councils

> After the fall of the original Revolutionary Councilâ€”the only one so far to be democratically electedâ€”over a dozen governments have appeared, only to fall again and be replaced by the next. Other incarnations include:

The [[Cailean Council]]
The Cailean Council believed that Galt could only be saved through change, and as a result changed almost everything in Galtan culture, from the alphabet to the names of the week.
The [[Common Council]]
Believers that anyone with a political background was unworthy of rule, thus elevated beggars and farmhands to positions of power within the council.
[[Eye of Law]]
This disastrous council was led by the monstrous [[Witch|witch]] Taxyla, when a [[Hag|hag]] coven took power.
The Cabinet of Skulls

### *Final blades*

> The first Revolutionary Council was responsible for commissioning the infamous *[[Nethys/Artifacts/Final Blade|final blades]]*. The original councillors wanted a humane, painless form of execution that would also prevent the supposedly [[Evil|evil]] [[Soul|souls]] they executed adding to the ranks of [[Hell]].
