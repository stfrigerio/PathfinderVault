> The **Andoran faction** within the [[Pathfinder Society]] represented the interests of the nation of [[Andoran]] and advocated for freedom throughout the Inner Sea.



## Background

> From humble beginnings as loggers and merchants, the [[Andoran|Andorens]] proved themselves survivors on a hard frontier. Even before they won their independence they were an impressive people. Brave explorers and canny merchants, they were the first to sail the sea beyond the [[Arch of Aroden]]. They settled distant colonies, hewing a life from wild lands and an inhospitable coastline fraught with peril. The power of [[Taldor|Old Taldors]] navy rested on the shoulders of capable Andoren commanders whose skill at arms, fiery tenacity, and naval puissance was unrivaled in the empire's glory day.
> Andoran shrugged off the auspices of Old Taldor when [[Qadira]] invaded the empire. Shortly thereafter they shattered [[Cheliax|Cheliaxs]] diabolic chains. Now Andoran holds the reins of its own destiny in the strong hands of its people. They are the first government of the [[Inner Sea]] to entrust its power to its own citizens instead of dolloping it upon the crowned brow of a king. Their weapons are innovation, a stubborn dedication to idealism, and a firm belief in the potential of humanity. The Andorens are a hard people, dedicated to freedom for all, and unable to sit by and watch as the world around them submits to savagery and tyranny.


## Goals: Common Rule for All

> Andoran would see the tyrannic empires who once ruled them brought down. They would see slavery abolished and those who would buy and sell people punished in the extreme. They would bring the torch of freedom to the world's darkest places and banish mysticism, diabolism, and fear. Common Rule must be spread across each horizon.


## Methodology: Light the Fires of Freedom

> The Andoran faction attacks its enemies from within. They find dissidents, freedom fighters, and revolutionaries among the populations of their foes and offer them covert aid, equipment, intelligence and the funds they need to topple the tyrants. Missions assigned to Andoran faction members tend toward helping dissident groups within the other factions, though anything that shakes these tyrants' power is a worthy cause for an Andoren to lend himself to.


## Retirement

> This faction no longer reports to Andoran. An independent watchdog organization known as [[Liberty's Edge faction|Libertys Edge]] takes its place, headed by the Andoran faction's former leader [[Colson Maldris|Major Colson Maldris]].
