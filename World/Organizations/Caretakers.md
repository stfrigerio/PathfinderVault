> The mute women called the Caretakers on the [[Smoker]] island in the [[Shackles]] serve the wise prophets known as [[Keeba's Eyes|Keebas Eyes]]. They wear [[Owl|owl]] masks and dress with simple tunics of rough-spun cloth tied with brightly colored sashes. The Caretakers are sent by the Eyes to escort the petitioners to the [[Cauldrons of Calm and Calamity]].
