> The **Order of Heralds** is (or was, as its current status is unknown) a [[Mendev|Mendevian]] organization that succeed in curbing the worst excesses of the [[Third Mendevian Crusade]], refocusing the Crusade toward fighting the external [[Demon|demonic]] threats of the [[Worldwound]], rather than on rooting out internal corruption. It managed to stop all internal purges by [[4692 AR]], the same year the [[Fourth Mendevian Crusade]] was launched to counter the attacks led by the [[Balor|balor]] [[Khorramzadeh]].
