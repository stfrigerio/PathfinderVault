> The [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] tribes of the southern [[Sodden Lands]] are each ruled either by warrior kings or by spell-casting [[Shaman|shamans]]. The most powerful of the kings have started referring to themselves collectively as the **Terwa Lords**.
> These Terwa Lords have been increasing their own personal power at the expense of their more peaceful neighbours, and are responsible for increasing the general aggressiveness of the lizardfolk nation. In particular, they encourage raids against neighbouring areas of the [[Shackles]].
> To date, none of the Terwa Lords has been able to dominate the others â€“ but the brutal warlord [[Girzanje]] might become the first to achieve this feat.
