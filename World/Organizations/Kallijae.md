> The **Kallijae** are a tribe of [[Mualijae]] who inhabit the north-western jungles of the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. They oppose the [[Gorilla King]] of [[Usaro]]. They have largely settled in and around [[Lake Ocota]] in small conclaves, with many clustered to north and northeast of Usaro.
> While many Kallijae settlements are temporary and often rebuilt, there are two major settlements: [[Haven]], the largest settlement and the island in the middle of [[Lake Ocota]], and [[Bere Nibi]] in the Bandu Hills.
