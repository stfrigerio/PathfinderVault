> The **Adamant Company** is a military organization who acts as the enforcer of the [[Black Triune]], the rulers of [[Nidal|Nidals]] shadowy capital, [[Pangolais]]. The organisation's main role is to enforce complete loyalty to the Triune within the [[Uskwood]] and beyond. They are lead by the ruthless [[Vampire|vampire]] general, [[Mykos Roarik]], who is an ancient veteran of the [[Everwar]].


## Religion

> As subjects of Nidal, the members of the Adamant Company are required to adhere to the state religion, that of [[Zon-Kuthon]]. Despite this, they also greatly respect the terrible [[Spawn of Rovagug]] known as the [[Tarrasque]], although they do not worship him or his creator [[Rovagug]] as a god. They simply see him as a perfect melding of drive and purpose, the absolute apotheosis of desire, form, and action.
