> The **Slaves of Goroyasa** is the self-given name of the [[Human|human]] inhabitants of the island of [[Goroyasa]]. The island of Goroyasa lies off of the south west coastline of the [[Valashmai Jungle]] and is as inhospitable as the rest of Valashmai is, its main difference is that every plant and animal on the island shares a strange fungal infection that grants them strange powers but saps their free will. The humans of Goroyasa, calling themselves the Slaves of Goroyasa, worship [[Cyth-V'sug|Cyth-Vsug]], demon lord of fungus and parasites, but how much influence Cyth-V'sug has over the island's fungal entity or even if he is aware of its existence is unknown.
