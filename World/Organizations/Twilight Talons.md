> The **Twilight Talons** are a secret [[Andoren]] espionage organization under the control of the larger [[Eagle Knights]]. They operate outside the government's acknowledgement, and serve as spies, saboteurs, deep-cover agents, and assassins. They target [[Slavery|slavers]] and agents of [[House Thrune]] to protect Andoren democracy and spread freedom across the [[Inner Sea region]].



## Leadership

> The Talons are headed by [[Helena Trellis|Marshal Helena Trellis]], though this is not publicly known due to the clandestine nature of the organization.


## Communication

> The Talons use a system of secret hand signals and passwords to recognize one other and pass on information. As the ultimate mark of identification, each agent is marked with a magical tattoo that only reveals itself when a unique phrase is spoken out loud.


## Operations

> The Twilight Talons have placed numerous agents among all of Andoran's main rivals including Cheliax, [[Taldor]], [[Katapesh]], the [[Shackles]], and [[Nidal]]. These operatives are assigned to gather information, and rarely reveal their presence or conduct any disruptive missions. The presence of these agents is only known to [[Reginald Cormoth]], the commander of the Eagle Knights, and Marshal Trellis. Talon agents also infiltrate groups without state support, such as slave traders, pirates, puppet extensions of the Chelish [[Church of Asmodeus]], and the mercenaries of the [[Aspis Consortium]]. They then report their findings to the Steel Falcons, who can take more direct action against these groups.


### Members

> [[Othine Dalanse]]: A one-time field agent and slave ring infiltrator, Othine earned the meritorious service award known as the [[Eagle's Ring|Eagles Ring]]. Her current status is undetermined but she was last seen in [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]].
> [[Whispershade]]: A [[Human|human]] male [[Paladin|paladin]] commander operating undercover in Katapesh.


## Heraldry

> Even though the Twilight Talons have no uniforms, epaulets, or other overt regalia, they do have a secret symbol: a [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Eagle|black eagle]] holding a [[Sword|sword]] and arrows.
