> The **Dragonscale Loyalists** are a group of hand-picked agents that serve [[Noleski Surtova|King-Regent Noleski Surtova]] and the [[Dragonscale Throne]]. To the world, Dragonscale Loyalists appear as little more than courtiers with some small training in the [[Aldori swordlords|Aldori sword arts]], but in truth they are agents of the crown, fiercely [[Vigilante|vigilant]] against treachery and with a supernatural ability to detect such treason. When they do root out sedition, the Dragonscale Loyalists don fearsome [[Dragon|dragon]] masks to become agents of Noleski's vengeance.
