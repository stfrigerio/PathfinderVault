> The **Hornbreakers** is a [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarian]] raiding party who have engaged in several years of successful raids into the [[Sarkorian Steppe]]. They are led by the grizzled [[Kellid]] barbarian [[Khraigorr Half-Face]].
> The sight of the Hornbreakers riding into a camp, their [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] and [[Mammoth|mammoth]] mounts decorated in horn trophies broken from the skulls and bodies of slaughtered [[Demon|demons]], is enough to raise a thunderous roar from any barbarian camp. They ride along the length of the border seeking [[Demon|demonic]] incursions to destroy and helping to rescue other raiding parties fleeing overwhelming odds.
> The Hornbreakers have caught the notice of the deadly demon named [[Gashgelag]], who nearly killed Half-Face once before.
