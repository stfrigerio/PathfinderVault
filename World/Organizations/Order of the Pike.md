> The [[Hellknights]] **Order of the Pike** was founded prior to the [[Chelish Civil War]], and officially disbanded in one of the post-war reorganisations. However, its members continued to operate as Hellknights and, in [[4688 AR]], it was recognised once more as an official (albeit minor) order.



## Philosophy

> The Order of the Pike seeks to slay monsters that jeopardize peace and innocent lives. More than mere killers, these Hellknights often take a naturalist's approach to their monster hunting, learning about their prey and extensively documenting this information. As a result, they have an impressive library of information regarding strange and dangerous beasts.


## Members

> Even at its creation, the original Hellknights dedicated themselves to the eradication of violent beasts that the government chose to ignore. These early members were ranchers and simple townsfolk and, although more modern members enjoy a more prominent reputation, their valiant ideals remain. Hellknights are more likely to be scattered throughout the [[Inner Sea region]], taking stations in monster-stalked regions.


## Bases of operation

> The Order is based in the tower of [[Citadel Ordeial]], on the northeastern edge of the [[Whisperwood]]. They operate as monster hunters, initially in northern [[Cheliax]], but more recently also in central Cheliax and [[Isger]]. The Order enforce the law and bring authority to the unclaimed lands of the [[Crusader Road]] operating from their citadel in [[Fort Inevitable]].
> The order's records, held in the citadel's Library of Fangs, hold extensive information about rare [[Giant|giant]] types, such as the [[Shadow giant|shadow giants]] occasionally seen in the [[Menador Mountains]], or the [[Cave giant|cave giants]] that sometimes raid the [[Scar Thicket]] of the Whisperwood.
