> The [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Barstoi]] boasts three [[Pharasma|Pharasmin]] monasteries: the **Chapel of Guilts**; the [[Mother of Skulls]]; and the [[Vault of Tears]]. The Chapel of Guilts lies in the north-west of the county near to the source of the [[Delgavia River]] and is by far the most well known and feared.


## Description

> The monastery does not have the conventional look of such a place, rather it resembles a fortress and has a salt mine annexed to it, such that parts of the monastery, such as catacombs, are carved out of the salt.
> The monks of the monastery follow a particularly severe form of the extreme [[Pharasmin Penitence]] and are especially interested in evangelism, flagellation and inquisition. The monks take these devotions outside the monastery as missionaries and as [[Witch|witch]]-hunters.


## Inhabitants

> - The monastery is led by Abbot Phavad Nholinarm who is responsible for the severity of the application of the Pharasmin Penitence.
> - The oldest member of the Chapel of Guilts is Witchfinder Judge [[Erdin Coim]] who refuses to retire from his duties as priest, witchfinder, judge, and [[Inquisitor|inquisitor]] for the faith.
