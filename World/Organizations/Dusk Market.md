> The **Dusk Market** is a wandering bazaar that sets up within the shells of fallen temples, theaters, and other opulent ruins within the [[Westcrown]] district of [[City districts of WestcrownParego Dospera|Rego Cader]]. Here the brave and foolish buy contraband, under the very eyes of bribed [[Westcrown Dottari|rundottari]] (local watch). [[Recreational drugs of Golarion|Drugs]], exotic [[Poisons of Golarion|poisons]], strange beasts, and kidnapped [[Slavery|slaves]] can all be found in this semi-secret marketplace.
> Run by a secret syndicate, it takes place at a different ruin each day in the two hours before sundownâ€”hence its nameâ€”to avoid [[Order of the Rack]] [[Hellknights]] and the city's dangerous creatures. For a price, almost any local ne'er-do-well can tell visitors where the market will set up next.
