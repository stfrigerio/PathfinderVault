> Founded by escaped [[Slavery|slaves]], the **Freemen** are a loose organization of abolitionists working in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Kaer Maga]]. They work to free any who live or pass through the city from bondage, but after encountering persistent resistance from the slave-holding power groups within Kaer Maga, have scaled back their operations to emancipating those they purchase in the city's slave market, and encouraging runaway slaves to join them.
