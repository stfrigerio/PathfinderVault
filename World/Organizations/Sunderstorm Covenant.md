> The **Sunderstorm Covenant** are a group that were instrumental in the Feather and Starlight Rebellion which established the [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]] nation of [[Kwanlai]]. The Sunderstorm Covenant are devout worshippers of [[Hei Feng]] and believe that lightning is the [[Deity|gods]] purest weapon and that it must be used to defend Kwanlai, even at the cost of the wielder's life. While they were an important part of the nation's founding, the Sunderstorm Covenant have declined in popularity over the years. Like the lightning they worship, they are unpredictable and often violent, encouraging those who suffer even a minor slight to respond with violence, which has led to further instability for the already struggling nation of Kwanlai.
