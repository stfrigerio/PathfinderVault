> The **Wyrmslaves** are one of the lesser tribes in service to the [[Carrion King]]. The tribe consists of 18 [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] and their powerful leader, the [[Behir|behir]] [[Lazzairhage]]. The gnolls of this tribe were once known as the **Al'Drogat,** but their tribe was almost completely wiped out by the behir that now rules them. 
> Though Lazzairhage is the most powerful member of the tribe, he is slow, and while he thinks the gnolls as his servants, the tribe's smarter gnolls have successfully convinced him to join the ever-growing army of the Carrion King.
