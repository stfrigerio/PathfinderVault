> **Iobane** is a core group of [[MwangiZenj|Zenj]] [[Magus|magi]] guardians of the [[Doorway to the Red Star]], deep in the heart of the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. It is led by [[Mpondo|Warder-Chief Mpondo]] and is dedicated to keeping outsiders from reaching the Doorway to the Red Star, believing they dishonor their ancestors. They see themselves as the spiritual successors of the [[PathfinderWiki/Ten Magic Warriors]]. They are determined to use lethal force against intruders who refuse to heed their warning.


## History

> The first Iobane famously fought alongside [[Old-Mage Jatembe]] and the [[PathfinderWiki/Ten Magic Warriors]] to repel the invasion of the [[King of Biting Ants]] through the doorway. The first Iobane had strong [[Psychic|psychic]] powers that helped disconnect the king from his minions.
