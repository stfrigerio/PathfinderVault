> The **Thunderscale** are the largest of the [[Kobold|kobold]] tribes that live in the jungles of [[Mediogalti]] led by Chief Indak Spikecatcher and are dominated by green-scaled kobolds. They make their home in the vast cave network known as the  [[Thunderscale Warrens]] and are known for their habit of painting their scales with bright plant dyes.
> Compared with other kobold tribes, they are comparatively tolerant of non-reptilian [[Humanoid|humanoids]], and engage in a small amount of trade with the [[Human|humans]] of [[Ilizmagorti]]. They can also sometimes be hired as cheap, but extremely knowledgeable, jungle guides.
> The Thunderscale tribe revere the [[Sorted Traits/creature/dinosaur|dinosaurs]] of the jungle as gods, and engage in extremely dangerous religious rituals. Captive dinosaurs are released amongst members of the tribe; those kobolds who manage to survive the experience are considered to be blessed by their "benefactors".
