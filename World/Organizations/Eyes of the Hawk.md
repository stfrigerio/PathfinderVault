> The **Eyes of the Hawk** are an historical adventuring party from the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]] who defeated the outbreak of [[Shriezyx|shriezyx]] from the [[Irespan]] in [[4623 AR]]. They were led by the twin [[Wizard|wizards]] [[Cailyn Vanderale|Cailyn]] and [[Romre Vanderale]], and managed to rally the [[Magnimar city watch]] to drive the spidery monstrosities back into the inner chambers of the bridge, after which they collapsed the entrance. Ever since this time, tampering with the Irespan, or even construction within 50 feet of it has been forbidden by law. The heroic actions of the adventuring party are commemorated by the [[Eyes of the Hawk monument]], which stands in the city's [[Dockway|Dockway district]].
