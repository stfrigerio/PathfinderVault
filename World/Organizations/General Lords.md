> The nine **General Lords** are the rulers of [[Molthune]] and commanders of the [[Imperial Army]]. The general lords rule as local governors, called **territorial governors**, and the **imperial governor** (currently [[Markwin Teldas]]) is selected by them from among their number. Currently, the general lords are bent on the reconquest of the rebellious former Molthuni province of [[Nirmathas]]. They meet quarterly in the [[Imperial Castle]] in [[Canorate]] to guide the war effort.
