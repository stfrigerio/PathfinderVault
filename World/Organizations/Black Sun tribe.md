> The [[Orc|orc]] **Black Sun tribe** traces its history all the way back to the warlord [[Belkzen person|Belkzen]] himself. The black sun was the standard of Belkzen and his vast army of orc tribes that crushed the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] at the [[Battle of Nine Stones]] in [[-3708 AR]] and conquered [[Koldukar]].


## Leadership

> Today the leader of the legendary Black Sun tribe is [[Krun Thuul]]. The tribe is strong and influential, even if other orc leaders dispute this claim, and any major undertaking in the [[Hold of Belkzen]] would better be supported by the Black Sun tribe.


## Territory

> Unlike the other tribes of Belkzen, the Black Suns do not lay claim to any land. Instead, they offer their services to any other tribe during the yearly Proving Time.
