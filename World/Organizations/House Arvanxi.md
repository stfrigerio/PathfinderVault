> **House Arvanxi** is a noble house residing in the city of [[Westcrown]] in [[Cheliax]].
> Formerly possessing great power and influence, House Arvanxi is a house in decline. When a favored daughter named [[Ileosa Arvanxi]] abandoned the family to marry the [[Eodred Arabasti II|king]] of [[Korvosa]], it created a scandal that the noble house never fully recovered from. Fortunately for the family, it continued to wield authority through city mayor [[Aberian Arvanxi]].
> Unlike the other 11 major noble families in Westcrown, House Arvanxi focuses on the mainland instead of the city's [[Rego Corna]] district.
> Three lesser families are beholden to House Arvanxi: House Mhartis, House Ciucci and House Rasdovain.
