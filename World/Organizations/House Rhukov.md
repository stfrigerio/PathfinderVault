> **House Rhukov** is the most powerful of [[Mirnbay|Mirnbays]] 22 noble houses. The last surviving splinter of [[Iobaria|Iobarias]] royal [[House Arjal]], House Rhukov controls Mirnbay's [[Wizard|wizards]] and arcane colleges. With their longtime allies in [[House Xsagi]], they hold much of the power in Mirnbay's convoluted political system.
