## Breaching Festival

> On the last [[Sunday]] of [[Desnus]], the [[Acadamae]]â€”Korvosa's prestigious magical universityâ€”holds the Breaching Festival: a carnival centred around the famous challenge to enter the college's heavily defended Hall of Wards and leave alive, earning fame and wealth in so doing. Very few succeed. Each year, by tradition, the Cerulean Society is invited to send a sole competitor to test the efficacy of the college's defences and, most years, the thieves' guild sends a participant. Boule desires the winnings and the university gains free testing.
