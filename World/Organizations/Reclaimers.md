*For another meaning of "Reclaimers", please see [[Reclaimers elves]].*
> The self-proclaimed **Reclaimers** consist of courageous crusaders, followers of the [[Green Faith]], and descendants of [[Old Sarkoris]] who are determined to restore the [[Sarkoris Scar]]. Their only permanent holding is the town of [[Gundrun]], which they have fortified with walls and *[[Wardstone|wardstones]]*. Otherwise, they prefer a nomadic lifestyle and focus on restoring wildernesses, since they believe that this way of life is cleaner and nobler than settled life, and that the Sarkoris Scar remains too blighted to settle. Two of the Reclaimers' primary targets are the city of [[Dyinglight]] and the great library of [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druidic]] lore deep in the [[Shudderwood]], but both sites remain in [[Evil|evil]] hands: the former is controlled by [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendish]], [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[Giant|giants]], the latter by corrupted, tormented [[Fey|fey]]. Even the wild [[Animal|animals]] in the Sarkoris Scar are tainted with the touch of the [[Abyss]], yet the Reclaimers are making slow, painful progress eliminating them from the land.
