> The **Tiger Lord barbarians** are a tribe of [[Kellid|Kellids]] along [[Brevoy|Brevoys]] borderlands who trace their lineage to an [[Age of Destiny]]-era band of conquerors that once swept from the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] to southeastern [[Numeria]] behind the warlord [[Armag]]. Even today, they are the Kellid tribe with the broadest range of travel, providing mercenaries to such places as the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] in the west to [[Iobaria]] in the east. The Tiger Lords draw their inspiration from [[Tiger|dire tigers]] and revere an immense [[Smilodon|smilodon]] named Speartooth as their totem.



## History

*See also: [[Armag]], [[Armag the Twice-Born]],Â and [[Nethys/Artifacts/Ovinrbaane]]*
> Armag led the Tiger Lords from the Realm of the Mammoth Lords across [[Numeria]] and into [[Brevoy]], crossing the [[Rostland Plains]] before [[Iobaria|Iobarian]] warlords and [[Casmaron|Casmar]] [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] halted his advance. Armag's audacity and brutality drew [[Gorum]]'s favor, while his boasts that he could not be killed wrought [[Pharasma]]'s wrath upon him; the two gods waged a battle of influence using the Tiger Lords and their enemies as proxies until Armag's death in battle against a [[Red dragon|red dragon]].
> Gorum bound Armag's [[Soul|soul]] into the [[Sword|sword]] *[[Nethys/Artifacts/Ovinrbaane]]* and inspired Tiger Lord [[Shaman|shaman]] Zorek to build Armag's Tomb in what would become known as the [[Stolen Lands]], all with the intent of keeping Armag's spirit out of Pharasma's [[Boneyard]].
> Around [[4610 AR]], the Tiger Lords were led by [[Armag the Twice-Born]], a supposed reincarnation of Armag advised by the Black Sisters. This new Armag was driven back to [[Pitax]] by Baron Hannis Drelev, where Armag the Twice-Born struck an alliance with bandits for vengeance.
