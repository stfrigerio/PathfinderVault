> **Spell lord** is an official title within the government of the city of [[Absalom]]. Held exclusively by powerful [[Arcane|arcane]] [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]], spell lords are appointed by the [[Government of AbsalomPrimarch|primarch]], and are tasked with overseeing the institutions of [[Magic|magical]] instruction within the city, regulating the casting of all [[Spell|spells]], and overseeing the magical defense of the city. They work outside the structure of the [[Government of AbsalomGrand Council|Grand Council of Absalom]] or the [[Government of AbsalomDistrict council|district councils]], reporting directly to the primarch. There are currently four spell lords within the city, each with his or her own duties.



## First spell lord

> Lord [[Gyr of House Gixx]] holds the title of First Spell Lord, and is also primarch of Absalom. (This is unusualâ€”the primarch chooses which lordship they hold, but it is traditional for them to choose Sea Lord.) He has been missing since [[4717 AR]], and Garethal Brighteyes is Acting First Spell Lord. The first spell lord is tasked with overseeing all centers of magical learning within the city and all questions of magic. The [[Arcanamirium]] is his particular concern.


## Second spell lord

> The second spell lord is tasked with the magical defense of the city and has significant military powers. Lady [[Darchana of House Madinani]], Archdean of the Arcanamirium, currently holds this title. It is unclear if she comes into conflict with the first spell lord, who is particularly responsible for the Arcanamirium.


## Third spell lord

> [[Utgar of Gyr]], who resides in [[Azlanti Keep]], holds the title of third spell lord. The third spell lord is responsible for the [[Spellcasting|spellcasting]] judges known as the [[Varlokkur]].


## Fourth spell lord

> [[Muar Gauthfollow]], who lives in [[Eastgate]], is the fourth spell lord.
