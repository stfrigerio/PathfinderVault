> The **Scarab Seekers** were a group of [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] who operated in secret in [[Osirion]] before the [[Khemet III|Ruby Prince Khemet III]] opened his nation to foreign exploration in [[4707 AR]].


## History

> Although the Scarab Seekers operated in secret within Osirion (since the exploration of Osirian tombs was illegal at the time), they were known by the [[Pathfinder Society|Pathfinder Societys]] leaders, the [[Decemvirate]], and sometimes operated under their direct instruction. Dozens of members cycled through the group over the years, many of them losing their lives or meeting other grisly ends, while others moved on to other things or were arrested as tomb robbers by the Osirian authorities. They disbanded after the Ruby Prince lifted the ban on exploration, as they no longer needed to operate in secret. Many ex-members remained in Osirion and joined the [[Pathfinder Society|Pathfinder Societys]] [[Sandswept Hall]] in [[Sothis]], while some joined or were recruited by the newly emergent [[Shadow Lodge faction]].


## Members
