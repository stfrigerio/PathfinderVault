> Though the [[Pactmasters]] are rarely seen outside their palace walls, they are keenly alert of all that transpires within [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]] through their network of spies and active patrols of the **Zephyr Guard**. The Zephyr Guard is made up of diverse ethnic groups and races, but mostly [[Humanoid|humanoids]] such as [[Human|humans]], [[Half-elves|half-elves]], and [[Half-orc|half-orcs]]. Their unifying feature is their expertise in combat and the precision with which they carry out their duties. A Zephyr Guard squad is usually composed of five elite soldiers and their squad leader. Each squad leader carries a *[[Charm of aluum control|charm of aluum control]]*, which is [[Magic|magically]] bound to them, making it useless to anyone else.


## Role

> The Zephyr Guard are tasked with a number of duties that makes them popular with the city's merchant class:

> - apprehending magical thieves
> - catching those who destroy property
> - protecting the elite of Katapesh
> Punishment for such crime is quick and painful: usually dismemberment for stealing. The guards rarely get involved in other crimes such as brawling.
