> **The Sewer Dragons** is a [[Kobold|kobold]] tribe that dwell in the sewers of [[Absalom]]. They have an aptitude for navigating tight spaces, mapping complex underground areas, and digging new passageways, all skills that are highly sought after. The tribe first tunneled into the drainage system in [[4696 AR]].
> The Sewer Dragons, as a tribe, happily accept any kobold willing to work leading to a much more varied skin colour range than found in other tribes.
> According to rumours, they can provide discreet tunneling and [[Trap|trapmaking]] services to various noble houses. Kibizax, the current leader, is an aging but ambitious chieftain with expansionist ideals. His likely successors are the clutchmates Yiddlepode and Yippitok who both work in secret to undermine the chief's more foolish schemes, attempting to institute a more stable rule. Only Kibizax's plea can bring forth Lirovelix, the tribe's [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] mascot.
