> The **Apotheosis Almorain** is the strongest faction of the [[Knights of the Eastern Star]], one of the two sects of the once shining [[Azlant|Azlanti]] order of armored [[Magus|magi]] known as the [[Knights of the Ioun Star]]. Chapters of the Knights of the Ioun Star are known as *almorains*, an [[Azlanti language|Azlanti]] term akin to "family" or "alliance". This almorain of the [[Knight|knights]] has survived and is headquartered in [[Oppara]]. 
> The knights focus their attention further to the east, in the [[Windswept Wastes]] of [[Casmaron]]. They believe that a resurgent cult of the [[Ninshabur|Ninshaburian]] hero-god [[Namzaruum]] will produce the leader destined to become the next emperor of Azlant.
