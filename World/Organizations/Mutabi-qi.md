> The **Mutabi-qi** is the name given to the tribal inhabitants of the [[Shaguang|Shaguang Desert]] who wander across those harsh lands. The lands of Shaguang were technically claimed by the [[Lung Wa|Empire of Imperial Lung Wa]] but, in reality, the Mutabi-qi were barely affected when the empire fell a century ago. Ethnically, the Mutabi-qi are originally of the [[Tian-La]] but they have developed their own culture. Despite the harshness of Shaguang, the Mutabi-qi hold a deep-seated appreciation for the beauty of this land. They are a nomadic culture that travels between the various oases that dot the length and breadth of the desert. The Mutabi-qi generally avoid the areas nearest to the [[Wall of Heaven|Wall of Heaven Mountains]] as they are infested with huge [[Vermin|vermin]], hungry [[Bulette|bulettes]], ferocious [[Death worm|death worms]], and even sentient menaces like [[Lamia|lamias]] and tribes of [[Ash giant|ash giants]]. The Mutabi-qi also try to avoid the migratory route of the colossal [[Kaiju|kaiju]] known as [[Yorak|Yorak the Horned Thunder]]; those whose territory Yorak wanders into have learned to appease him by holding festivals full of song, dance, and lots of loud drumming, which seem to calm Yorak's otherwise infamous temper.
