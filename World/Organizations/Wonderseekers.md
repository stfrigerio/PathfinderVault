> The **Wonderseekers** are a largely [[Gnome|gnomish]] organization that helps gnomes across the [[Inner Sea region]] battle the effects of the [[Bleaching]] by exposing them to new experiences, stories, and adventures. They are an informal group with little defined structure and no significant leadership (as befits a group dedicated to destroying mediocrity, routine, and apathy). They were founded in the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Corentyn]] before [[4606 AR]] by a gnome who has taken on the name Pai-shay Wonderseeker.
