> The **Carrionwalkers** are one of the [[Eloko]] tribes that inhabit the town of [[Elokolobha]] on the boundary of the [[Screaming Jungle]] in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. This tribe was exiled long ago from the upper spires and forced to live in the carrion-filled crevasses below. The Carrionwalkers learned to survive in their horrid territory. The tribe's high priest is [[Guumkhonto|Guumkhonto the Plaguespear]].
