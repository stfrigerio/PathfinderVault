> **The Brattlebunch** is group of [[Leshy|leshy]] troublemakers and pranksters operating in [[Absalom]], targeting mostly businesses and individuals that harm the plants, animals and the nature as a whole. The group has developed a reputation among Absalomians as both one of the most amusing and annoying local crime gangs.
> The Brattlebunch was by Tumult Flower Flourish at the instruction of the [[Circle of Stones]]' second in command, [[KorhC3BCl|KorhÃ¼l]], and the two organizations are closely connected, whether its members know it or not. The attacks are always orchestrated from the [[Grand Holt]], and Tumult Flower Flourish primarily uses the gang to spy for the [[Circle of Stones]] and report to [[KorhC3BCl|KorhÃ¼l]] and Iolanthe. In turn, the [[Circle of Stones]] often backs up and helps the gang.
> The gang maintains a vast information network throughout the city by using their affinity for plants. Their targets are usually greedy slaugherhouse owners, cruel animal handlers, and especially employees of the Absalom Menagerie zoo. The Brattlebunches are also interested in disrupting the Street Performers and Actorsâ€™ Guild and its leader [[Alain Always]]. The gang is active in the [[Eastgate]], the [[Ivy District]], the [[Petal District]] and the [[Precipice Quarter]]. Several members keep an eye on [[The Docks|the Docks]], and newly arrived leshys swiftly receive a visit from Tumult Flower Flourish and a friendly offer to join up. Since the fast urban streets of Absalom are generally seen as hostile and unfriendly by most leshys, Tumultâ€™s offer is often accepted eagerly and immediately. Now, most of the Brattlebunch members are newborn or newly arrived leshys who band together out of fear of the cosmopolitan world around them.
