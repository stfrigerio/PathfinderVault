> **Precentors Martial** govern military affairs in [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] under the absolute authority of the [[Watcher-Lord]]. The five Precentors Martial have the authority to exploit civil resources but they rarely apply it. They are the Precentor Martial for Cavalry, the Precentor Martial for Infantry, the Precentor Martial for Garrison and Siege, the Precentor Martial for Scouting, and the Precentor Martial for Magic. Their civil equivalent in Lastwall are the [[Tribunes]].
> The current Precentor Martial for Magic, who also leads the Battlemage Academy of the [[Crusader War College]], is the dynamic fire-haired [[Veena Heliu]].
> The current Precentor Martial for Scouting is [[Keyron Saiville]].
