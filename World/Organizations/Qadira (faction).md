> The **Qadira faction** within the [[Pathfinder Society]] represented [[Qadira|Qadiran]] satrapy of the [[Kelesh|Keleshite Empire]], particularly its trade interests in the [[Inner Sea region]].



## Background

> The westernmost satrap of the Padishah of Kelesh, [[Qadira]] is a kingdom with the power of the sprawling [[Casmaron]] empire at its back. Qadira is Kelesh's doorway to [[Avistan]], and is perhaps the single most valuable piece of real estate on [[Golarion]]. Rivers of [[Spice|spice]] and gold flow through its capital of [[Katheer]], and [[Xerbystes II]], the Satrap of Qadira, boasts correctly that his kingdom holds the wealth of any other three on the Inner Sea.
> Qadira has long been a power to be reckoned with. [[Taldor]] has felt the bite of their scimitars and nearly lost their entire empire in the struggle. [[Osirion]] bowed before them for over three thousand years. The war drums of Katheer have been silent for an age, but they never stopped waging their wars. Gold is their weapon now, spices are their shield, and their incredible trading power is their armor.
> Qadirans value wealth above all else and they seek to make their fortunes abroad. The wealth of [[Absalom]], and more importantly the trading opportunities proffered by control of the great city, has long drawn the gaze of the satrap's most powerful merchant princes. Many Qadirans are ready to leave their deserts behind for the promise of lustrous Absalom gold.


## Goals: No Life without Trade

> The world is small and gets smaller everyday. The key to power is trade. Qadira couldn't care less who sits on the Grand Council of Absalom, so long as the Qadiran trade fleet dominates the harbor. Qadira plans to rule the Inner Sea's trade and then bleed their enemies' coffers dry. Collecting debts and supplying the demands of other nations' peoples is how Qadira plans to rule. If their kingdoms slave to send gold east, the satrapy remains contented.


## Methodology: All that Glitters is Power

> The Qadiran faction seeks trade and economic advantage above all else. They seek to break their enemies' monopolies and enforce their own. They offer wares and goods no one else can supply and destroy competition with a ruthlessness that put the devil-bowing [[Cheliax|Chelish]] to shame. Qadiran missions involve a greater plan, usually embarrassing or defaming an economic rival, or ruining the business of another nation's trade companies. 


## Leadership

> Pasha [[Muhlia al'Jakri|Muhlia alJakri]] retired after a controversial killing related to a Pathfinder Society mission in [[4711 AR]]. She was replaced by [[Aaqir al'Hakam|Trade-Prince Aaqir alHakam]].


## Retirement

> Aaqir al'Hakam bought this faction's assets after the [[Year of the Demon]] and partnered with former [[Sczarni faction]] leader [[Guaril Karela]] to create an independent trade cartel known as The Exchange.
