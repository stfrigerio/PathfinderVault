> The **Jah-Ipo** priesthood is a small group of [[Cleric|clerics]] that maintains the grave sites of [[Gebessek IX]] and the aboveground levels of the [[Pyramid of Masks]] in the [[Gozarin Necropolis]] in southern [[Osirion]]. Their authority does not extend beyond these distinct locations but they are uneasy with the way [[Adventurer|adventurers]] and tomb delvers pillage the lesser and older graves of the expansive necropolis. In [[4707 AR]], with [[Khemet III|Khemet IIIs]] opening of Osirion's tombs to explorers, the Jah-Ipo lost their right to arrest and try grave-robbers.
> [[Echume Hepripe|Father Echume Hepripe]], a paranoid and aggressive priest of [[Nethys]], is the current leader of the Jah-Ipo. He often orders Jah-Ipo guardians to spy on visitors to the necropolis.
