> **House Parastric** is one of the twelve most powerful [[Drow noble houses|noble houses]] of the city of [[Zirnakaynin]] and therefore of the [[Drow|drow]]. They are considered one of the lesser houses, as they are not quite as powerful as some of the others and are secretly reviled by most other drow; nonetheless, they are too powerful to be ignored. The House's patron is [[Haagenti]], the Whispers Within, [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of [[Alchemy|alchemy]] and change, who encourages her worshipers to indulge in the creation of monstrous new life. House Parastric is unique amongst the twelve noble houses in that they do not maintain a palace within Zirnakaynin, but instead have it outside the walls of Cocyrdavarin, in a place now known as the [[Moaning Vault]]. 
> House Parastric has maintained its power throughout the years due to their possession of a powerful secret: the art of [[Fleshwarping|fleshwarping]]. They have used it to create deadly guardians, like the [[Drider|drider]], powerful laborers like the [[Ghonhatine|ghonhatine]], or twisted living art like the [[Irnakurse|irnakurse]]. In addition to fleshwarping, they have created the technique called [[Fleshcrafting|fleshcrafting]], in which monstrous appendages are grafted onto a drow's body. Almost every member of House Parastric has had some fleshcrafting performed on them, and some even undergo full fleshwarps. The house's matron, [[Astranovidova Parastric|Astranovidova]], is guarded at all times by her daughter, [[Mardeis Parastric|Mardeis]], whom she had transformed into a drider.
