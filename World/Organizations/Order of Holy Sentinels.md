> **The Order of Holy Sentinels**, sometimes phrased **The Order of the Holy Sentinels**, was founded by the three disciples of Saint [[Clydwell]].
> They are based in [[Clydwell Keep]], largest of the fortresses guarding the [[Mendev|Mendevian]] border with the [[Worldwound]]. They are tasked with defending the *[[Demonscope]]*, the [[Artifact|artifact]] which powers the [[Wardstone|Wardstones]] that defend Mendev from [[Demon|demonic]] incursions. The *Demonscope* can affect the minds of mortals, so only the strongest of soul of the crusading [[Knight|knights]] of [[Mendev]] are invited to serve in the Order.
> The Order seeks to display the virtues of truth, sacrifice and valour.
