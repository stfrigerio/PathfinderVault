*See also: [[Pure Legion enforcer]]*
> The **Pure Legion** is the national law enforcement agency of [[Rahadoum]]. Their primary mission is to keep the Kingdom of Man free from religion in any form, including spoken and printed scriptures and sermons, proselytising, [[Holy symbol|holy symbols]], and other paraphernalia.
> This task is carried out through meticulous searches of all persons entering through the busy ports of [[Azir]], [[Manaket]], and [[Botosani]] and patrolling the vast deserts of the country's interior. When rumors of an underground cult change from being whispers of heresy to shadows of the truth, it falls upon the Legion to rout out the offending worshipers, whether through force or by manipulating a seemingly unrelated public disturbance which they can then clean up, in either case coming out looking the part of heroes.
> The Legion stands apart from the other government organs in Rahadoum, being answerable only to the First Law of the [[Laws of Mortality]].
> The centre of the organisation is the citadel of [[Shepherd's Rock|Shepherds Rock]], which houses their vast store of confiscated religious texts. The leader of the organisation, [[Karsakim]], the Sword of Man, is also based at the citadel.
> The traditional clothing of the Pure Legion is a white and gold garment that provides some resistance to [[Divine magic|divine magic]].
