> The **Dvezda** were a clever and strong tribe of [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] who united the clans of the [[Dvezda Marches]] and claimed the territory as their own. They were wiped out by the [[Dvezda plague]] sometime after this, but there are still some rare centaurs born in the Marches who have the characteristic bridled coat of the Dvezda. These centaurs are said to be **Lost Dvezda**.
