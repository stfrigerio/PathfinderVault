## History

> Eleven centuries ago, Falehetu, a student of the [[Monastery of Untwisting Iron]], lost a bout to an Unbreaking Waves student. Furious over this loss, he used a forbidden technique to create an earthquake that unleashed a tsunami upon the Monastery of Unbreaking Waves, drowning most of its students. The people of [[Niswan]] knew that the tsunami was [[Magic|magical]], but never learnt about Falehetu's involvement and assumed that the Monastery of Unbreaking Waves brought destruction upon itself.
> As the survivors attempted to rebuild the Monastery of Unbreaking Waves underwater, they were attacked by Falehetu, who was also caught in the tsunami and transformed into a [[Kurobozu|kurobozu]]. They managed to fend him off and imprison him in a partially restored building, but suffered great losses in doing so and were forced to abandon the half-reconstructed monastery under the sea.
> Many years later, Wavebreak Haven was settled by a community of [[Undine|undines]], who found the ruins of the Monastery of Unbreaking Waves with records of its techniques still intact, and began to learn and practice its traditions. After Falehetu's defeat in [[4718 AR]], the Monastery of Unbreaking Waves was formally re-established.
