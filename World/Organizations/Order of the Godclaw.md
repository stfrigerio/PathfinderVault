 A Hellknight of the Order of the Godclaw.
> The **Order of the Godclaw** (sometimes written "Order of the God Claw"; sometimes referred to as the **Hellknights of the Godclaw**) is a [[Hellknights|Hellknight]] order that extols the virtues of five [[Deity|deities]], distilling select tenets into a dogma far from any one [[Deity|gods]] faith. Not content with seeking [[Divine|divine]] approval for their [[Knight|knighthood]]'s righteous path, the Order of the Godclaw's members have sculpted their beliefs from the harshest, most exacting philosophies of five [[Lawful|lawful]] deities: [[Abadar]], [[Asmodeus]], [[Iomedae]], [[Irori]], and [[Torag]]. Remade as five stern, armoured paragons, the deities of this pantheon are known collectively as the [[Godclaw]]. The Hellknights follow revised doctrines to stamp out disorder, particularly its divine embodiments and beings of absolute [[Chaos|chaos]], with religious zeal. Rather than targeting the faiths of prominent religions, the order sets its eyes on supporting lawful crusades (such as the wars fought by [[Molthune]] and [[Mendev]]) and being at the vanguard of battles against the forces of chaos. No land is beyond the lawfulness provided by Hellknightsâ€”a fact the Order of the Godclaw endlessly seeks to prove.



## Leadership

> The cunning [[Lictor]] [[Resarc Ountor]] leads his order from [[Citadel Dinyar]] in [[Isger]], at the headwaters of the [[River Iseld]].


## Philosophy

> Although members of the Godclaw pay homage to the lawful doctrines of the gods Abadar, Asmodeus, Iomedae, Irori, and Torag, it is uncertain from where they get their [[Divine magic|divine power]]; it may be the case that their [[Magic|magic]] comes from their own convictions.
> Other Hellknight orders enforce their visions of law out of duty and necessity, but the Godclaw is inspired by religious zealotry and a clear belief that the world must learn the righteous path through force.


## History

> The Order of the Godclaw began with [[Seldinin Choaz]], a ranking member of the [[Order of the Pyre]], who led four of his fellow Hellknights to aid the [[First Mendevian Crusade]] in [[4623 AR]]. Their successes abroad won them the unofficial title, Order of the Godclaw. The group continued its crusade against the [[Worldwound]] [[Demon|demons]] until [[4665 AR]], when they abandoned the Leaden Cathedral in [[Mendev]] at the start of the [[Third Mendevian Crusade]] to return to [[Cheliax]]. Impressed by their efforts, the Order of the Pyre sponsored the small but wealthy group, formalizing the Order of the Godclaw as a recognised Hellknight order. Construction of Citadel Dinyar began soon afterwards.
> In [[4715 AR]], [[Iomedae|Iomedaean]] [[Knight|knights]] of the [[Glorious Reclamation]] raided Citadel Dinyar and reclaimed an [[Artifact|artifact]] of their goddess. The assault inspired rebels inside Cheliax, leading to the empire declaring martial law in several of its cities.
