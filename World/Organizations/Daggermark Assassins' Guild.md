> The **Daggermark Assassins' Guild** is an organization of hired killers based in [[Daggermark]], in the [[River Kingdoms]].



## History

> Three centuries ago, an [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|assassin]] army left their home, the city state of [[Yenchabur]] in [[Casmaron]], just before it was destroyed by a firestorm. The army battled its way through Casmaron and into [[Avistan]] in search of a new home. They eventually took over the town of Rivermark, in the [[River Kingdoms]], and re-named it [[Daggermark]].


## Guild school

> A school of assassins was established in Daggermark, and was openly called the Daggermark Assassins' Guild. It teaches the Three Preceptsâ€”Life, Death and the Vessel Between (*i.e.*, the assassin)â€”to all who wish to be taught. The [[Fighting style|fighting style]] of the Vessel Between relies on stealth, agility and secrecy. The Guild also has close links with the more recently established [[Daggermark Poisoners' Guild|Daggermark Poisoners Guild]].
> Lady [[Janna Smilos]], who has the title Supreme Vessel of the Assassins' Guild, currently runs the school.
> The Guild's masters are available for difficult jobs, most significantly for Daggermark society the students are available to anyone at a reasonable price with only two caveatsâ€”a person may only hire one student assassin per year, and the military could not be targeted. It is estimated that each month five citizens die from assassination or poisoning.
> All members are required to teach at the school at some point during their service.


## Hawk's Nest

***Main article: [[Hawk's Nest|Hawks Nest]]***
> Whilst the school is in the city of Daggermark, the Guild's home is a fortress known as the [[Hawk's Nest|Hawks Nest]]. It is built into a cliff face, and is designed to withstand a siege. Members (apart from those teaching at the school) live here whilst awaiting assignment. Non-members are not allowed inside.
> There are rumours that the families of the assassins live in a secret underground settlement beneath the fortressâ€”something the Guild denies.
