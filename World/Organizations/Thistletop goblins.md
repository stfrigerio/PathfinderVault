 The Thistletop goblins defend their lair.
> The most powerful [[Goblin|goblin]] tribe in western [[Varisia]], the **Thistletop goblins** take their name from the ruins they call home, and which allows them to maintain their powerful position. Led by Warchief [[Ripnugget]], the tribe has long held the island fortress of [[Thistletop]] and nearby forest of [[Nettlewood]]. In [[4707 AR]], an [[Aasimar's Mercy|aasimar]] [[Cleric|cleric]] of [[Lamashtu]] named [[Nualia Tobyn]] united the four other local [[Goblin|goblin]] tribes under the Thistletop tribe and plotted to invade and destroy the nearby town of [[Sandpoint]]. Unfortunately for the tribe and its leadership, their plans were foiled and their stronghold was raided by local [[Adventurer|adventurers]].
