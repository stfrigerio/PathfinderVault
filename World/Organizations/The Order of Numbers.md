 Abadar's Holy Symbol
> ***The Order of Numbers*** is the primary holy book of the faithful of the [[Deity|god]] [[Abadar]], the Master of the [[First Vault]]. Each copy is extensively decorated and contains detailed lists of the religion's rules and taboos.


## Lawgiver

> The [[Lawgiver]], the [[Herald|herald]] of Abadar, is said to understand numerous languages, but can only communicate by speaking numbers, measurements, and by quoting passages from *The Order of Numbers* and Abadar's other major holy text, *[[The Manual of City Building]]*.
