> The **Revenant Princes** are a group of [[Galt|Galtan]] aristocrats who fled to the [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Gralton]] after their homeland ousted them from power in the [[Red Revolution]] that began in [[4667 AR]]. They now bide their time in exile, slowly amassing mercenary armies, making raids into Galt, and waiting for the perfect time to return and overthrow the [[Revolutionary Council]]. Prominent members include [[Halidan Tarne|Lord Halidan Tarne]], his cousin [[Casal Tarne|Casal]], and the [[Dela Morgayn|Lady Dela Morgayn]].
