> The **Merrosett** family is influential throughout [[Taldor]] and are noted as talented [[Wizard|wizards]], particularly [[Evoker|evokers]] and [[Conjurer|conjurers]]. The family also maintains its own [[Knight|knights]], reportedly bred only from within the family, as shown by the sickly appearance shared by most of the knights.
