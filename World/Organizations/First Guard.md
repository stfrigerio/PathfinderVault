> In [[23 AR]], the [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]] himself commanded a group of volunteers to defend [[Azlanti Keep]] during the First Siege of [[Absalom]]. This unit eventually became the **First Guard**, the army of Absalom that protects the state from external threats.



## Mission

> Today, the First Guard is an elite force of warriors, wizards and scouts solely dedicated to uncovering and quelling threats to the safety of [[Absalom]]. It is headquartered in [[Azlanti Keep|Azlanti Keeps]] [[Grand Vault]] with the city watch. The First Guard mans the keep and serves as the core of the city's army, commanding other forces in times of war. The commission to command the First Guard is for life, and the force's vow is to protect the city, not the [[Government of AbsalomGrand Council|Grand Council]]. The First Guard is always at less than 20% capacity unless there is an active siege.


### Eagle Garrison

> While the main branch of the First Guard patrol the walls of Absalom, the **Eagle Garrison** patrols and protects the rest of the [[Isle of Kortos]] and its surrounding lands.


## Leadership

> The force's current leader is [[Chun Hye-Seung]], Captain of the First Guard and Commander Militant of Absalom. She is assisted by [[Symo of Wynsal]], First Siege Gear, and [[Utgar of Gyr]], Third Spell Lord. Lord Yuvin Vatir of House Damaq is Quartermaster and Silver Sword. Former captain Rothos of [[House Vastille]] was killed by the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] himself during the siege of [[Absalom]] in [[4719 AR]]. The captain before him, [[Wynsal Starborn]], has retired from the force, but holds the District Seat on the Grand Council.


## Recent history

> The First Guard helped fight off two recent attacks on Absalom. The first was the [[Fiendflesh Siege]] of [[4717 AR]], in which a strange alliance of [[Demon|demonic]] and [[Undead|undead]] forces took part. The most recent was an attack by the forces of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] himself in [[4719 AR]] that left behind the [[Necromancy|necromancy-blighted]] landscape to the east of Absalom called the [[Tyrant's Grasp|Tyrants Grasp]].
