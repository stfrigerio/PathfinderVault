> Under [[Cheliax|Chelish]] rule, the guards and wardens of the city of [[Kintargo]] were known as the **Kintargo Dottari**. The name [[Dottari|dottari]] is used to denote Chelish city guards elsewhere in the country, such as the [[Westcrown Dottari]].



## History

> In the decades before [[Barzillai Thrune|Lord-Mayor Barzillai Thrune]] arrived and scoured the city's dottari, it had a reputation for being loose with enforcing the city's laws, which cost it at least one recruit.


### Under Thrune

> Under Lord-Mayor Thrune, they were commanded by Duxotas Vannases Trex, who was the city's "high warden" and answered only to Thrune.


#### Uniforms

 The Chelish emblem, used on dottari uniforms.
> Under Chelish rule, members of the Kintargo Dottari wore black leather or chainmail [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] trimmed in red, and the Chelish emblem (a red circle quartered by a cross) on their shields.
> The dottari also served as the city's excrutiators and meted out public corporal punishment against prisoners on Lord-Mayor Thrune's orders. In this role, they wore black leather trousers and chainmail aprons with hoods that obscured their faces.


#### Organization

> Duxotas Trex was appointed by Lord-Mayor Thrune upon his appointment to the city by [[House Thrune]]. She demands loyalty and compliance from her subordinates, many of whom were also brought from outside of Kintargo by Lord-Mayor Thrune to replace existing dottari officers.
> In most of Kintargo, its dottari patrolled in groups of three and actively enforced Lord-Mayor Thrune's 9 a.m.-to-6 p.m. curfew alongside the sanctioned Chelish Citizens' Group militia.


#### Sites

> The dottari maintained a central barracks and administrative space in [[Castle Kintargo]], and staffed several towers within the city's walls. These towers also contained holding cells for criminals and political detainees before being transferred to the [[Holding House]] or [[Kintargo Keep]].
