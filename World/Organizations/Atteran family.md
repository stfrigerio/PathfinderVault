> The **Atteran family** is the most prominent of the [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horse]] ranching families of a region of northern [[Nidal]] known as the [[Atteran Ranches]]. It is not known whether the region is named after the family or vice versa. [[Vaide Atteran]], the family's patriarch, has been largely successful at keeping the agents of the [[Umbral Court]] at bay, maintaining a large amount of autonomy for the region. The Atteran family, and the other great families of the Ranches, maintain this independence by policing the region themselves, keeping out foreigners and curtailing the excesses of the lesser families.
