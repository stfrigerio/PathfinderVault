> The **Collectors of the Abattoir** serve as corpse collectors for the city of [[Vyre]], gathering the city's bodies for cremation in the [[Blissful Abattoir]] or, at least, so it appears. In truth, the Collectors of the Abattoir are not the civic-minded worshippers of an obscure [[Psychopomp|psychopomp]] [[Psychopomp usher|usher]] that they claim to be; they are, in fact, devotees of the deceptive [[Deity|god]] [[Norgorber]] in his aspect as the Gray Master. Unbeknownst to the rest of the City of Masks, the Collectors of the Abattoir do not cremate the dead but, instead, sell them to all manner of sinister organisations for reanimation as [[Undead|undead]] and purposes even fouler. They are led by [[Quentin Crabb]], a consummate liar who has helped maintain their image as orange-clad, [[Plague|plague]]-mask-wearing servants of the death goddess even in the face of investigations by the church of [[Pharasma]] itself.
