> The **Daggermark Poisoners' Guild** was established in the [[River Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Daggermark]] 90 years ago by a poisoner from [[Cheliax]] named Ambras Imre. Many blame the Guild for the death of the last king of Daggermark, who choked to death at dinner within a few months of Imre's arrival in the city.  The Guild's current leader is [[Tragshi|Tragshi the Herbalist]]. It has close links with the [[Daggermark Assassins' Guild|Daggermark Assassins Guild]], and its reputation has spread across [[Avistan]] and even beyond.
