![[Mikogu_Shimazi.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Mikogu Shimazi, a Golden League war leader.
> Originally founded in [[Minkai]] in [[Tian Xia]], the Golden League is an organisation dedicated to manipulating markets, both legitimate and otherwise, in order to obtain wealth and power for themselves.


## History

> Formed in [[4559 AR|7059 IC]] with the merger of a merchant house and a thieves' guild during a time of desperation, the two families controlled the economy of [[Minkai]] until its eventual collapse in [[4571 AR|7071 IC]]. The Golden League was banished from the nation by the emperor, forcing them into hiding until eventually resurfacing in [[Goka]] in [[4580 AR|7080 IC]].
> Although exiled and humiliated, the Golden League proved itself to be both resilient and resourceful. Learning from their previous errors, they began influencing markets in more subtle ways, using a mixture of bribery, extortion, threats and assassinations.


## Methods & Organization

> The Golden League now consists of dozens of powerful families in Goka, although they hold influence in every city in [[Tian Xia]]. Each family keeps a group of tattooed warriors at their disposals. These soldiers and [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|assassins]] are known as the Xun. Locals rightfully fear and respect these warriors, granting them deference upon seeing them.
