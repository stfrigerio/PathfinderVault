*For other meanings of "**Hellknight**", please see [[Hellknight disambiguation]].*
> The **Hellknights** are a collection of [[Knight|knightly orders]] with a unique focus on the promulgation of [[Law|law]]. They are interested less in the social [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|goodness]] and charity typical of [[Paladin|paladins]], but rather in the foundation and stringent maintenance of order at all costs. In their iron-handed exaction of lawâ€”specifically, the laws of their various orders and their home country of [[Cheliax]]â€”Hellknights emulate the organized and effective armies of [[Hell]]. They are not concerned with morality or methods, only results. If people cannot be trusted to obey the law out of their own senses of civility and social righteousness, Hellknights provide the need to obey out of fear of a master's stern hand.



## History


### Daidian Ruel and the White Plague

![[Daidian_Ruel.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Daidian Ruel]], the first Hellknight.
> The family of [[Daidian Ruel]], a [[Westcrown|Wiscrani]] worshiper of [[Aroden]], was killed by members of the [[Demon|demonic]] [[Path of Grace]] cult in [[4575 AR]] as part of the years-long [[White Plague]] of murder and suicide. Ruel was refused justice by cult collaborators among Westcrown's upper classes, and he abandoned his faith and formed a vigilante posse to capture, beat, and kill the cultists. The [[Westcrown Dottari]] did not approve of his vigilante methods and arrested him in [[Sarenith]] of [[4576 AR]], but his followers broke him out of prisonâ€”against his own ordersâ€”hours later and absconded to [[Fort Rivad]], then a [[Taldor|Taldan]] ruin.
> Ruel subsequently returned to the city and gave an impassioned speech indicting Cheliax's inaction against corruption and [[Chaos|chaos]] before [[Gaspodar|King Gaspodar]], who was so moved that he pardoned Ruel and commissioned him to form a new knightly order. The speech, now known as [[Merciless speech|Merciless]], remains one of the Hellknights' most important [[Philosophy|philosophical]] texts.


### Founding of the Hellknights

![[Citadel_Rivad.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 [[Citadel Rivad]], first headquarters of the Hellknights and current home of the [[Order of the Rack]].
> By [[Sarenith]] of [[4577 AR]], Ruel's order defeated the Path of Grace, and a grateful King Gaspodar gave Fort Rivad to be the knights' permanent home and authorized its restoration into [[Citadel Rivad]], which was completed in [[Neth]] of [[4580 AR]]. Ruel's public and repeated rejection of Aroden led the [[Deity|gods]] followers to dub the group "Hellknights", a denigration that Ruel defiantly adopted and which effectively made Ruel the first Hellknight. Ruel recruited his ally [[Sheel Leroung]] to his cause; Leroung would go on to form the [[Order of the Gate]] at [[Citadel Enferac]] in [[4599 AR]] and is known as the first [[World/Culture/Titles & Kings/Hellknight signifer]].


### Infernal influence

> Ruel became obsessed with the thought that the [[Soul|soul]] of his [[Eris Ruel|son]], who died by cult-encouraged suicide, was [[Damnation|damned]] to Hell's topmost layer of [[Avernus]], and sought Leroung's aid in [[Summon|summoning]] [[Devil|devils]] and interrogating them for information. Ruel incidentally learned much about how Hell organized its legions, and in respect of those methods incorporated them into the Hellknights'.
> However, Ruel came under the influence of [[Voulgarghas]], a [[Gelugon|gelugon]], who convinced him to search for ways to save his son's lost soul. In [[Calistril]] of [[4589 AR]], Ruel disappeared on the same night as a fire at Citadel Rivad's library and the death of one of Leroung's apprentices. He was never seen again, and while Hellknights believe Voulgarghas knows of Ruel's fate, the gelugon has kept that knowledge secret.


## Philosophy

> Regardless of their severity, Hellknights are not an inherently [[Evil|evil]] group; they are wholly unconcerned with morality. Although there are numerous evil membersâ€”particularly among their upper echelonsâ€”the majority of the orders are impartial arbiters and enforcers of order and justice. They see the study of Hell's tenets and even the summoning of devils as tools meant to intimidate and strengthen the individual resolve of the orders' members. Hellknights are taught to replace emotion with steely discipline, and are not interested in methods: only the end results matter.
> While Hellknights are widely feared and respected, the common Hellknight joins out of a sense of duty and a wish to be a part of something greater, seeing a world ruled by laws and free of rampaging beasts and cheating thieves as a future well-worth striving toward, even at the sacrifice of freedom. Countries and rulers sometimes invite Hellknights into their lands, leaving the dirty business of harsh law enforcement to an already loathed third party, although convincing Hellknights to leave once they have been welcomed sometimes proves problematic for more freedom-loving societies.


## Training

> They train with summoned devils, the signifers of their orders coaxing the ingenuity of diabolical tactics from infernal tongues, while the rank and file members spar against the very denizens of Hellâ€”making nearly any future conflict a far less daunting prospect. They learn that sacrifices must often be made for the greater good, obey draconian regimens of military conduct, commit to encyclopaedic memorization of the laws of their orders and local governing bodies, and undergo constant drills to train their bodies and minds.


## Appearance

![[Hellknight.jpg|right+hmed]]

> Every order of Hellknights has a distinctive, intimidating style of [[Nethys/Equipment/Armors/Full Plate|full plate]] [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] that distinguishes them from the others that is only allowed to be worn after the individual Hellknight has defeated a devil in combat. All Hellknights wear the armor of their order as a matter of pride and are rarely seen without it. The [[Order of the Nail|Order of the Nails]] armor, for example, features a horned helm and demon-faced [[Nethys/Equipment/Armors/Breastplate|breastplate]].
> 


## Organization and orders

> Following Ruel's disappearance in [[4589 AR]], his successor [[Aligois Thels]] reorganized the Hellknights' structures to align with the ranks of the ancient legions of the [[Jistka Imperium]].


### Organization

***Main article: [[Hellknight ranks]]***
> The leader of a Hellknight order is known as the lictor, while a leader whose training is more scholarly and less martial is known as a vicarius. Beneath him are an order's master or mistress of blades (field commanders) and paravicar (leader of the order's arcane/religious forces). Beneath them, paralictors (Hellknight officers), signifers (Hellknight spellcasters), rank and file Hellknights, and armigers (Hellknights in training) flesh out the ranks.


### Major orders

> There are numerous orders of Hellknights. Most have holdings in Cheliax, but a few have expanded or moved to operate outside the country, most typically in regions formerly held by the empire. Below are the seven major orders and their headquarters in alphabetical order:

> - [[Order of the Chain]] at [[Citadel Gheradesca]] near [[Corentyn]] (Cheliax)
> - [[Order of the Gate]] at [[Citadel Enferac]] near [[Pezzack]] (Cheliax)
> - [[Order of the Godclaw]] at [[Citadel Dinyar]] in the [[Aspodell Mountains]] ([[Isger]])
> - [[Order of the Nail]] at [[Citadel Vraid]] near [[Korvosa]] ([[Varisia]])
> - [[Order of the Pyre]] at [[Citadel Krane]] near [[Ostenso]] (Cheliax)
> - [[Order of the Rack]] at [[Citadel Rivad]] near [[Westcrown]] (Cheliax)
> - [[Order of the Scourge]] at [[Citadel Demain]] near [[Egorian]] (Cheliax)

### Lesser orders

> Numerous lesser orders of Hellknights exist, although few are known outside the borders of Cheliax. Although less pervasive, these smaller orders are only slightly less feared than their better-known brethren.

> - The [[Order of the Coil]] was formed in the former colony of [[Sargava]] (now known as [[Vidrian]]), and sought to prevent the "pollution" of the colonists by native cultures It's current status since the reforming of the government under strictly local control is unknown.
> - Little is known about the secret [[Order of the Glyph]].
> - The [[Whisperwood|Whisperwoods]] [[Order of the Pike]] hunts down monsters
> - [[Egorian|Egorians]] [[Order of the Scar]] stalks assassins
> - The [[Order of the Torrent]] rescues victims of kidnapping, but have been in severe decline for the past several decades.  It exists almost entirely in [[Kintargo]].

### Extinct orders

> - The [[Order of the Crux]] was hunted into extinction by the Order of the Scourge, although three [[Graveknight|graveknight]] members remain.
> - The Order of the Thorn was destroyed by the Order of the Pyre during the Chelish Civil War, with the decisive battle being the two-week Siege of Demain in [[Arodus]] of [[4635 AR]].
> - The [[Order of the Vice]] exclusively battled threats from the [[Great Beyond]].

## Favored familiars

> Signifers choose loyal, disciplined [[Familiar|familiars]] who respect authority. [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Dog|Dogs]] and [[Hawk|hawks]] contribute to success on the battlefield, and [[Arbiter|arbiters]] and [[Imp|imps]] reinforce the Hellknights' adherence to law.
