> The **Winter Council** was a group of advisors, and later secret manipulators, that influenced [[Elf|elven]] policy across [[Golarion]]. It was especially active in [[Kyonin]], where it worked through proxies to keep the existence of [[Drow|drow]] a secret from the rest of [[Golarion]].
> As of at least [[4717 AR]], the Winter Council has dissolved and is no longer active.



## History

> The council was not always a secret society. It started off as an organization whose members advised the [[Elf|elven]] rulers and served as elven ambassadors to [[Azlant]]. However, even in those days they engaged in some secret intelligence gathering, and it was one such operation that allowed them to anticipate the oncoming [[Earthfall]]. 
> They found out information which led them to believe that the rise of the [[Azlanti]] had been secretly aided by [[Alghollthu master|alghollthu masters]], and that the alghollthus were upset by the egotism of the Azlant and were planning to wipe them out.
> Most of the elves withdrew prior to Earthfall and the subsequent [[Age of Darkness]], and the Winter Council withdrew with them. The organization embraced more and more secrecy, and when the elves returned, they adopted the policy of operating completely through proxiesâ€”both elven nobles and later the *Shin'Rakorath*, or [[Lantern Bearers]]. The council itself faded into the background.
> The discovery of the [[Drow|drow]], and the fact that elves could spontaneously transform into them through the Dark Fate, caused the council to create the Lantern Bearers to deal with them.


### Outlook

> The council believed it had the age, experience, and talents that made it both their right and responsibility to make hard decisions and guide the elves through hardship. They were not particularly concerned if a few innocents suffered in the process. In any conflict between tradition and progress, they always came down firmly on the side of tradition.
> This approach often brought them into conflict with [[Kyonin|Kyonins]] more progressive ruler, [[Telandia Edasseril|Queen Telandia Edasseril]], who was happy to see the council's demise. For a long time, the council was too secretive and influential for Queen to move openly against them.
> The council's main political concerns were keeping the true nature of the drow secret, and hiding the fact that one of its members has become a renegade.


### Return to Thorn's End

> The council's traditional headquarters, the fortress of [[Thorn's End|Thorns End]], was situated within what had now become the [[Tanglebriar]], the domain of the [[Demon|demon]] [[Treerazer]]. The building's ancient wards kept it relatively intact, and the council concluded that with the aid of an artifact known as the *[[Maleficus Spike]]*, they could make it effectively "demon proof".
> In an act of incredible hubris, the council moved back into Thorn's End and defied the demons to do anything about it. They now had a secret base in which to carry out their plans, in a location completely safe from the attentions of any other elven factions.


### Dissent within the council

> One of the council's members, the famous general [[Allevrah]] proposed an audacious plan to destroy the [[Drow|drow]] by calling upon the same alghollthu magic that the council believed had caused Earthfall. The plan would unfortunately also ensure the destruction of much of [[Nirmathas]], [[Varisia]], [[Cheliax]], [[Druma]], and [[Andoran]], collateral damage that Allevrah insisted could not be helped.
> The rest of the council refused to agree, and a fight broke out in which Allevrah killed the council's leader, Auramesties. She then damaged the *Spike* in order to cover her escape.
> The demons were emboldened by the weakening of Thorn's End's wards and put the stronghold under permanent siege.
