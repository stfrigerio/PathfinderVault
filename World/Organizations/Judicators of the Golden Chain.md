> **The Judicators of the Golden Chain** are fifteen [[Devil|devils]] bound to each other in a circle with [[Gold|golden]] chains. They are the greatest of [[Mammon]]'s servants and manage the high level affairs of [[Erebus]], such as requests from the [[Material Plane]] and the transferring of valuables to other layers when needed by the other [[Archdevil|archdevils]]. An example of the meritocracy of [[Hell]], the group of [[Pit fiend|pit fiends]] and three unique devils count two [[Erinyes|erinyes]] among their number. The two furies have had their wings removed and in their place are trailing, animate silhouettes of golden chains. It is rumored that at least half of the Judicators have been seduced by [[Belial]].
