They were tolerated for a time in the open and friendly town of [[Hajoth Hakados]] in the [[Numerian Plains]], but recently their predations proved too severe, and the residents drove them out. Their secret [[Former Catspaw Marauders Guildhouse|headquarters]] in the town are abandoned.
> In [[4675 AR]], Catspaw Marauders backed [[Kamdyn Arnefax]] in his devastating sneak attack on the forces of [[Razmiran]] on the west bank of the [[West Sellen River|Sellen River]] that became known as the [[Moonlight Massacre]].
