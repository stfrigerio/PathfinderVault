> The **Valdemar family** is a once-prosperous family that has recently fallen on hard times. Found primarily in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]] and the nearby village of [[Sandpoint]], the family once generated significant revenue through their fishing, shipping, and logging businesses. They have lost much of these through competition with the less ethical [[House Scarnetti|Scarnetti family]], and due to recent tragedies. The head of the family is [[Ethram Valdemar]] who resides primarily in Sandpoint, while the family's remaining business in Magnimar is overseen by this son, Kaleb Valdemar.
