> The **Moniwa family** are a [[Minkai|Minkan]] noble family who have ruled over the [[Akafuto Province]] for over a millennia. Thanks to their careful rulership, Akafuto Province and the city of [[Akafuto]] are renowned for their political stability. The current governor is [[Moniwa Kamon]], though he earned much scorn from his own people by immediately siding with the [[Jade Regent]] after he claimed power.
