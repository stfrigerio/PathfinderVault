> At the height of [[Azlant|Imperial Azlant]], the **Knights of the Western Star** formed one of the two sects of the Azlanti shining order of [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armored]] [[Magus|magi]] known as the [[Knights of the Ioun Star]]. They served the emperor and the empire's Throne of Glass directly in business and intrigue within the empire, while the Knights of the Eastern Star searched the lands beyond the empire's borders for secret lore.
> The few Knights of the Western Star who survived [[Earthfall]] eventually came to serve the Living God [[Aroden]], whom they believed to be an embodiment of the Last Azlanti prophecy, the [[Starfall Doctrine]], while the Knights of the Eastern Star never believed that the [[Deity|god]], Aroden, was truly the Last Azlanti.
> The legendary, lost Sanctum of Aroden, somewhere below the streets of [[Absalom]], became the modern headquarters of Aroden's faithful Knights of the Ioun Star.
> Records of the [[Knight|knights]] accompanying Aroden in the early years of the city of Absalom abound, and armored Knights of the Ioun Star stood alongside the [[Human|human]] cultural hero in his struggles against the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]], his defense of Absalom, and other adventures from the [[Age of Destiny]] through to the [[Age of Enthronement]].
> Remnants of the ancient Azlanti Knights of the Western Star, that once served as Aroden's personal guard, perished when they were sealed within the Sanctum of Aroden under Absalom, upon the god's death.


## Ancient History

> In -6270 AR, during the [[Age of Legend]], Imperial Azlanti authorities divined the location of the exiled [[Wizard|wizard-prince]] [[Nhur Athemon]], in Brokenhelm Hill, on top of the [[Emerald Spire]], in what today is the northwestern [[River Kingdoms]]. They then launched a powerful attack, with an army of the Knights of the Ioun Stone, lead by Lady Estrekan of Almorain Blue, Knight Commandant of the Western Star.
