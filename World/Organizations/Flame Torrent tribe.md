> The **Flame Torrent tribe** of red-scaled [[Kobold|kobolds]] live near the heart of the [[Volcano|volcano]] [[Droskar's Crag|Droskars Crag]] serving the ancient [[Magma dragon|magma dragon]] [[Moschabbatt]]. The tribe is led by [[Ipmaark]] and worships Moschabbatt. Their makeshift settlement stands on the banks of the lava lake [[Blood of the Mountain]], which is the dragon's lair, and their proximity to the lava has hardened them against extreme heat. The kobolds work as Moschabbatt's servants, lookouts, guards, and excavation workers. 
> As skilled tinkerers, they have constructed levers and pulleys for transporting [[Dwarf|dwarven]] loot through a tunnel system and installed many well-crafted traps to deter intruders.
