> The **Firebrands** are a loose organization of daredevils, liberators, and fighters against injustice with a reputation for sowing chaos in the wake of performing ostentatious acts.



## History

> In [[4716 AR]], when the two newly-independent nations of [[Vidrian]] and [[Ravounel]] established diplomatic and trade relations, their respective [[Silver Ravens|freedom-fighting]] [[Salt Breakers|representatives]] also found that they shared an interest in fighting oppression and helping those who cannot protect themselves, and thus formed the Firebrands, sharing assets to combat tyranny where they could.


## Goal

> The Firebrands are unofficially divided into two factions: those who fight tyrants, help those in need, and work to rebuild after the revolution; and those who seek thrills and to bring attention to themselves. The former once tried to dissociate themselves from the latter, before realising that their work is made much easier when public attention is kept on the show-offs, and many Firebrands are part of both groups.


## Structure

> The Firebrands have no official structure. Instead, an individual's standing is based on their reputation; the more famous ones are considered higher-ranking. Every member is divided into four rankings, known as marks.
> Anyone can declare themselves a Firebrand, though membership only becomes official when the recruit earns some notoriety, usually when several dozen locals or a handful of nearby Firebrands become aware of them. After this quick process, the first mark is earned. Since this process is so easy, first marks come and go constantly, and are usually not considered truly official members until the second mark is earned.

> A Firebrand earns their second mark by being declared an official Firebrand by a member of second mark or higher, either publicly or among fellow Firebrands. Regardless of the publicity, the declaration comes with a symbolic gesture of the Firebrand and the first mark crossing [[Weapon|weapons]] or arms. Second marks gain access to the local Firebrands' resources.
> Third marks are recognised when the local populace knows of the members or groups in question; in the latter case, all members of that group are classed as a third mark regardless of individual standing or seniority. The fourth mark is awarded to those known across [[Golarion]], whether individuals like Devrin Arlos or groups like the [[Silver Ravens]] (whose members are all fourth marks). There are no official thresholds for the third or fourth mark, only a nebulous consensus. Many Firebrands like to debate whether a specific individual or group deserves the fourth mark, but certain key members are universally recognised as fourth marks.
> Although it is easy to join the Firebrands, the group has two ways to sniff out potential infiltrators. The Firebrands never intentionally harm innocents, and those who do so in their name never become second marks and usually attract the attention of proper Firebrands. Individuals that might be harmful to the Firebrands are also not informed of updates to local networks' secret codes and signals, and soon become obvious outcasts. Even when such protocols are absent, the Firebrands can still rely on local allies, who report any concerns to other members and allow the group to respond accordingly.


## Members

> When a small uprising in [[Galt]] pretended to be associated with the Firebrands, they quickly tried to offer support, and even though the uprising failed, the Firebrands' attempt to help became known. Many other rebels did the same, and claiming to be a Firebrand quickly became the easiest way to join the group, which acknowledge everyone who adopt the title and share their goals.


## Sites

> Firebrands can be found all across the [[Inner Sea region]], especially in large cities where there are plenty of people to provide attention or crowds in which to disappear. These cities also allow would-be Firebrands to join a Firebrand [[Ship|ship]] and set off in search of treasure.


## Relationships

> The [[Free Captains]] usually disdain the Firebrands, but are sometimes willing to provide transport when needed. [[Hurricane King|Hurricane Queen]] [[Tessa Fairwind]] seems to be inconstant, enjoying the Firebrands' antics on some days and disliking them on others.
> Adventurous Firebrands tend to find the [[Pathfinder Society]] alluring and join for the opportunity to hunt for relics and knowledge across Golarion, with the [[Horizon Hunters faction|Horizon Hunters]] being seen as particularly conducive.
> Authorities tend to find Firebrands a nuisance due to their tendency to cause collateral damage. Firebrands often oppose laws that they find oppressive (a distinction that can vary greatly between individuals), working alone or with locals depending on the situation. Rarely, authorities are willing to overlook the Firebrands' schemes, no matter how obvious, for the good of the community.
> Firebrands constantly find themselves at odds with the [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]], and work to evade their eyes and grasp.
