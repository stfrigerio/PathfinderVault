> The **Molthune Armsrunners** are a group of mercenaries based in [[Logas]] in [[Isger]]. They deal in shipments of high-quality arms in [[Cheliax]] and also smuggle infernal weaponry back to [[Molthune]], [[Andoran]], and [[Galt]]. It is not known if they are being controlled by Andoren paymasters, obeying [[Molthune]]'s governors, or doing it of their own accord. Rumor has it that the weapons go to the rebels and nobles alike. The Armsrunners' agents often work in the city of [[Misarias]], recruiting guards, customers, or scouts within Cheliax's borders.
