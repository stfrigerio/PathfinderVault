> The **Shouk** is a tribe of degenerate [[Ogrekin|ogrekin]] that once were [[Human|human]] holy men. Their lair is in the [[Barrier Wall]] mountains, roughly south-east of the [[Thuvia|Thuvian]] city of [[Duwwor]]. Once the Shouk were holy men and [[Oracle|oracles]] of some renown. Their wisdom was sought by many other nomadic tribes. However, at some point in the distant past, this clan of holy men became tainted by the blood of [[Ogre|ogres]] and ogrekin began to be born among the ranks of the Shouk. With each generation the taint spread, and more and more brutish, vile ogrekin were born. Now the tribe is composed exclusively of ogrekin, and has lost all prophetic ability. Purely out of tradition, the tribes of the area still occasionally seek out the Shouk in times of great need. These visits rarely yield any result other than the loss of life, as the Shouk are also now cannibals.
