> The **Scarlet Rose** is an organization of former [[Gray Maidens]] who abandoned all ties to their former master [[Ileosa Arabasti]] and remained in the city of [[Korvosa]]. Its members act as a support network for those who seek to undo the indoctrination and heal the trauma of their shared past. The group holds Korvosa's wellbeing as one of their primary goals, acting as guardians to the city they once terrorized. Most Gray Maidens alive today are either members of the Scarlet Rose or their bitter rivals, the [[Cheliax]]-based Erinyes Company, who remain loyal to Ileosa's memory and now gladly serve another cruel ruler. The Scarlet Rose enjoys good relations with the [[Silver Ravens]] and the followers of [[Shelyn]].
