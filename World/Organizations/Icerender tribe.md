> The **Icerender tribe** is a [[Kobold|kobold]] tribe that lives in a pass in the [[Tusk Mountains]]. The kobolds work tirelessly to keep the pass open. A lot of caravans use that mountain pass in order to avoid the attacks of the white dragon [[Lydek|Lydek the White]] in the south. The kobolds sporadically attack and loot the caravans and then they dispose of the remnants of them. A large part of the loot the kobolds obtain, is offered to Lydek the White as a tribute.
