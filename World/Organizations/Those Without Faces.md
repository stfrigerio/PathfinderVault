> **Those Without Faces** were a group of [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]]-priests who sought to communicate with otherworldly beings. They operated from an ancient, massive, seven-tiered pre-[[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] ziggurat on [[Thoska Isle]] that has since been overgrown and buried over time and now known as the [[Grass-Shrouded Ziggurat]].
