> The taciturn **Larko family** was one of the three families who founded the town of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] in [[4573 AR]]. The Larko family was the one to step up and sacrifice their eldest son to marriage with the [[Hag|hag]] [[Ulizmila|Ulizmilas]] daughter to ensure the community's survival, in [[4603 AR]]. But the same neighbors Larkos' sacrifice saved would seize upon the Larkos' tainted bloodline. During the Falcon's Feud, in [[4701 AR]], the family was eradicated by mass burning.
