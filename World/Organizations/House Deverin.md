> The **Deverin family** is one of the most down-to-earth aristocratic families in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city of [[Magnimar]]. They are led by the elderly [[Hobart Deverin]], whose understanding of the plight of regular Magnimarians has earned him the nickname "the Simple Lord". Along with [[Deverin Villa]], their modest town manor located in the [[Naos]] district, they also own the [[Fancy Reefclaw]], one of Magnimar's most successful breweries. A branch of the family sailed north with four other important Magnimarian families in [[4666 AR]] to found the town of [[Sandpoint]], and continue to live there to this day. [[Kendra Deverin]] is the current leader of that branch of the family, and is also the mayor of Sandpoint.
