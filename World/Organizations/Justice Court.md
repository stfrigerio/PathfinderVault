> The Justice Court of [[Magnimar]], sometimes referred to as the **Justice Council**, is the city-state's highest court. This body of thirteen Justices acts as the final arbiter of the city, ruling on disagreements when the law itself comes into question and determining the guilt or innocence of those who come before them accused of breaking the law. Among the thirteen Justices, one serves as Lord Justice and maintains order within the Court; currently the position is held by Bayl Argentine. The Court meets in the [[Pediment Building]] in the [[Capital District]], the lowest levels of which serve as a prison for the city's most hardened criminals, known as the [[Hells]]. Associated with the Justice Court are the [[Halls of Virtue]].
