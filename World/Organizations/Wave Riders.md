> The **Wave Riders** of [[Absalom]] are a [[Hippocampus|hippocampus-mounted]] light cavalry unit that protects the harbor of the City at the Center of the World, as well as the entire coastline of the [[Isle of Kortos]].


## Tactics and resources

> Excellent scouts, the Wave Riders are also trained to harass [[Ship|ships]] by attacking their hulls and throwing combustibles into the rigging. They also target enemy naval officers and attack [[Magic/Conjuration|summoned]] or trained enemy aquatic creatures. Another tactic involves quickly approaching small vessels and attacking its occupants before they have a chance of mounting a serious defense.
> Most Wave Rider cavalry units only operate within sight of land, as their air-breathing riders cannot sleep underwater, even if their steeds can. To overcome this obstacle, special "wave tender" barges were built in the port town of [[Escadar]] that resemble giant, floating doughnuts. Their inner pool allows the hippocampi to access the sea while the riders rest on the ships. The cavalrymen are equipped with a uniform of [[Magic|magically]] buoyant leather [[Nethys/Equipment/Armors/Breastplate|breastplates]] with sea-green capes, and are generally armed with [[Crossbow|crossbows]] and [[Spear|spears]].


## Training

> Members of the Wave Riders receive their hippocampus training from the [[Gillman|gillmen]] of Escadar on the [[Isle of Erran]]. The Low Azlanti occasionally join the cavalry company, even though they are still seen with some suspicion by the general populace, despite their obvious superiority in the aquatic environment.
