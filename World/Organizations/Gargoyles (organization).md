> **The Gargoyles** are [[Magnimar]]'s most refined gang if they can even be referred to by such a common and demeaning term. The Gargoyles are an elite, hand picked group of skilled cat burglars that rob throughout the wealthy districts of [[Summit Magnimar district|the Summit]] and view themselves as well above the [[Sczarni]] gangs that operate in the slums of Magnimar. The group is overseen by [[Vammiera Symirkova|Lady Vammiera Symirkova]] an ageing aristocrat with magical gifts who controls the gang from behind the scenes. Many of the Gargoyles' most high profile raids are lead by Vammiera's daughter the beautiful yet cold [[Mizmina Symirkova]].
