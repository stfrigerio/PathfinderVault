> The **Swifthooves** is one of many nomadic [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaur]] tribes living on the [[Egobarius Plain]] in southern [[Cheliax]]. They are led by [[Menamyn Vox]] and it is the largest tribe in the region.
> Like most centaurs in the area, the Swifthooves tend to prefer the traditions and inter-tribal politics of their own people. Even so, under Menamyn's leadership they occasionally aid victims of bandit attacks.
> Centaurs of the tribe have been known to interact with Chelish society, and even leave the tribe entirely. Menamyn's sister, [[Maidrayne Vox]], grew tired of the tribal traditions and politics and abandoned it in favor of the [[Order of the Nail]]: she currently serves the [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]] as their [[Mistress of Blades]].
