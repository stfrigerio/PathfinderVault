> **White Stewards** is the most respected and successful "ice cleaving" company of [[Trezira]]. In [[4623 AR]] [[Elvanna|Queen Elvanna]] granted the monopoly of the "ice cleaving" vital task on the [[Frozen Road River]] to the small town [[Trezira]]. Teams of fur-clad ice wardens sail up and down the Frozen Road all through the year dealing with the ice that constantly threatens the flow of life-sustaining foodstuffs, lumber, and other goods. They use their distinctive "breaker barges".
> The White Stewards company is led by [[Trepek Gorny]]. Trepek is a laconic man who lost his twin sons in [[4713 AR]] in a ice cleaving run 20 miles west of [[Chillblight]]. The other six companies that are involved in the ice cleaving business are trying to exploit Trepek's mourning, spreading rumors that Trepek's sympathies lie with the town of [[Atvan]], which has long coveted Trezira's lucrative monopoly.
