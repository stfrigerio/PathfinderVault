> The **Dominion of the Black** (also known by many names, including the **Dominions of the Black** and the **Black Truth**) is a malevolent, [[Galaxy|galaxy]]-spanning conglomerate of aliens, known for eating memories, stealing thoughts, inhabiting bodies and destroying numerous [[Planet|planets]] over the aeons. The Dominion of the Black has been described as a "mysterious consortium of emissaries," suggesting that it may in fact act as a lower hierarchical rung that serves the malignant incomprehensible intelligences that rule the aether of the [[Dark Tapestry]], the lightless places between the [[Star|stars]].



## History

> The Dominion of the Black first took note of [[Golarion]] around [[-4363 AR]], when the *[[Divinity]]* crash-landed in [[Numeria]] after fleeing a Dominion attack through a [[Wormhole|wormhole]]. Though Dominion forces could not follow the *Divinity*, they had planted several [[Rhu-chalik|rhu-chaliks]] during the battle, which were able to transmit their location to their masters.
> References to the Dominion of the Black were first found in the [[Ancient Osiriani|hieroglyphs]] of ancient [[Osirion]]. Some of the earliest inscriptions allude to visitors descending from the stars, "making playthings of men" and offering "gifts of [[Mind quakes|mind quakes]] when favor [was] found and obliteration when it [was] not." Some paintings surviving from this period depict the victims of flesh-warping plagues and laborers with insectoid limbs.
> The Dominion is believed to have had profound influence over the rise of the four [[Pharaohs of Ascension]] at the dawn of Osirion's [[Second Age of Osirion|Second Age]] in [[-1498 AR]]. The [[Pharaoh|Pharaohs]] made unprecedented [[Magic|magical]] and [[Technology|technological]] strides during their reign and are known to have received 11 powerful gifts from an otherworldly patron. The [[Pharaoh of Numbers]] was also notably obsessed with the [[Planet|planet]] [[Aucturn]], which itself is believed to be tied to the Dominion.
> In [[4598 AR]] a Dominion agent known as the [[Emissary from Beyond]] was able to influence the [[Lirgen|Lirgeni]] [[Astronomy|astronomer]] [[Gelviel Zorriah]] to create the [[Spaceship|spaceship]] *[[Lirgen's Glory|Lirgens Glory]]*. The ship launched [[4600 AR|two years]] later only to be overtaken by the Emissary in [[4656 AR]]. Once the Emissary finished corrupting the crew, it turned the ship around and ultimately crash landed in [[Isger]] in [[4712 AR]], where it briefly attempted to make preparations for a larger invasion force.
> A separate Dominion force touched down in the [[Scar of the Spider]] in [[4709 AR]]. This force was tasked with investigating the ruins of the *Divinity*, and quickly set about reverse engineering a recovered [[AI]] core and retrofitting two [[Annihilator robot|annihilator robots]] for their purposes.
> Some believe that the ancient Osiriani countdown clocks point to a date early in [[4718 AR]], which these scholars claim is the date a massive Dominion invasion force will arrive on Golarion.


## Structure

> The Dominion of the Black is a loose collection of alien races with an intergalactic range and no central home or headquarters. A family of genetically engineered speciesâ€”[[Neh-thalggu|neh-thalggu]], bah-thegga, bah-uurla, [[Deh-nolo|deh-nolo]], jah-tohl, rhu-chalik, and [[Yah-thelgaad|yah-thelgaad]]â€”comprise the front lines of their vaguely expansionist actions. [[Lunarma|Lunarmas]], the [[Neshmaal|neshmaal]], and [[Yangethe|yangethes]] are also associated with Dominion activity.
> Above these servants is an amorphous hierarchy of priestly [[Chyzaedu|chyzaedu]] and haeshi-shaa, as well as navigational [[Shipmind|shipminds]].
> Beyond this collection of beings, the most powerful documented entities of the Dominion include:

> - The-Five-Who-Speak-As-One, who reportedly lives on a massive organic spaceship
> - Infinity-Ceases-Now, an amoeba-like monstrosity inside a rogue planetoid
> - Grandchild-of-Eternity's-Despair, an administrator of unknowable appearance who rules the Dominion's fleshfarms
> - [[Tychilarius]], They Drown the Gods in Oblivion (sometimes mistranslated as the Drowned God), a tremendous aberration made of thousands of creatures supposedly fused in the heart of a [[Black hole|black hole]]

## Symbology

> A symbol used by the Dominion of the Black to represent the Dark Tapestry is a strange tangle of tentacle shapes.


## Technology

> The foundation of most Dominion of the Black activities are its fleshfarms. These facilities are said to be the size of nations, and their operations are overseen by the jah-tohl. The fleshfarms are built to receive entire species as they are conquered by the Dominion, which are used both as slaves and raw materials in the manufacture of new servant races for the Dominion.
> Likely the most iconic of all Dominion technologies are their shipmind-driven cyborg spaceships that can range in size up to that of continents or even [[Moon|moons]]. The larger of these are capable birthing lesser ships for use as shuttles. These ships are often unable to lift off after landing, as the Dominion does not consider pulling back after an invasion has begun. Once on the ground, the organic components of these ships slowly rot, [[Poison|poisoning]] the land, and the former crew recycles the metal to harvest or corrupt native species.


## Relationships

> Among the Dominion's closest relationships are those with [[Intellect devourer|intellect devourers]], which serve various research purposes, and [[Vespergaunt|vespergaunts]], which often serve as scouts and emissaries.
> Beyond the creatures known to work alongside their forces, the Dominion of the Black has several other notable relationships.


### Aucturn

***Main article: [[Aucturn]]***
> Golarion's [[Solar system|solar system]] includes the mysterious living planet Aucturn, and researchers of that distant world suspect its ruler Carsai the King to be connected to the Dominion. Also known as the Stranger, Aucturn may be Golarion's link to the Dark Tapestry.


### Cults

> A small number of cults devoted to the Dominion of the Black operate across the [[Inner Sea region]]. Because the Dominion has little interest in engaging [[Humanoid|humanoids]] on their own terms, these cults see little support from their patrons and are largely disorganized in their activities.
> One especially active cult is lead by [[Abtaroh Vorenic]], whose family has a long history of exposure to Dominion agents. She operates her cult from her family estate in [[Macridi]].. These cultists wear distinctive magical amuletsâ€”black discs ringed by white dots, common to other Dominion cultists on Golarion.


#### Night Heralds

***Main article: [[Night Heralds]]***
> The [[Night Heralds]] are the most organized cult devoted to the Dominion of the Black. While their practices may seem religious to outsiders, they think of themselves more as diplomats. These fanatics hold that defeat at the hands of the Dominion awaits all, and therefore seek to have their brains harvested by the neh-thalgguâ€”a fate they see as a sort of immortality.


### Great Old Ones

***Main article: [[Great Old One]]***
> Though Dominion texts such as *[[The Last Theorem]]* make seemingly reverent references to the [[Great Old One|Great Old Ones]] and their [[Old Cults|cults]], most scholars on the subject are convinced the Dominion is actually in open conflict with both. The [[Shub-Niggurath]]-worshiping [[Mi-go|mi-go]] are deserving of special note in this category, as they are known to have carried on an eons-long conflict with the Dominion of the Black. [[Nyarlathotep]] views the Dominion as just another group of [[Mortality|mortals]] that he can manipulate in order to sow chaos and despair.


## Scholarship

> Many who study the Dominion on Golarion go mad from the effort, leading mainstream scholars to deem most sources on the subject unreliable at best. Nonetheless, irrefutable traces of the Dominion's past and present influence on the world are readily found by those who know where to look, and even the texts and scholars most detached from reality still offer truths about this distant group. Libraries in [[Katheer]], [[Omash]], and [[Sedeq]] all reportedly contain works about the Dominion in their stacks, as do private libraries across the Inner Sea region, including a collection in [[Egorian]].
> Known scholars on subjects related to the Dominion of the Black include:

> - Abdullah Aben of [[Sedeq]].
> - Anekept of [[An]], whose research led him to believe the ancient countdown clocks of Osirion are counting down to a harvest.
> - Co Latimer of the Nightstone Academy in Absalom.
> - Fulvia Nostraema, committed to the [[Darakole Sanitarium]] in [[Vyre]], author of an essay on her belief that the Dominion uses [[Black hole|black holes]] to perform tremendous ceremonial sacrifices of slaves and Dominion ships alike.
> - [[Gaius Beaulenard]], an [[Oppara|Opparan]] [[Aristocrat|aristocrat]] who arranged for his own death after attempting to directly contact the Dominion.
> - [[Imed Ibn Surhal]], a deceased [[Qadira|Qadiran]] sage who went mad after publishing *Apocalypse at the Dark Center of the Universe*, a treatise suggesting the Dominion seeks complete extermination of all sentient life in the universe.
> - Paucol the Gray in Absalom's [[Grand Lodge]].
> - Rouolon Ulmer of [[Manaket]].
> - Shayla Aaosk, committed to the [[Havenguard Asylum]] in [[Caliphas]].
> - Teramin Mais, an [[Aspis Consortium]] agent in [[Ostenso]].
> - Van Jeust, author of *Lords of the Night Heralds*, a collection of cryptic articles describing the Dominion and its goals.
> - Dr. Verid Oscilar of the [[Sincomakti School of Sciences]].

### Other works

> The following texts are of unknown authorship.

> - *Account of the Hierophant*, *Predators of Light*, and *Life Slake* are rambling descriptions of Dominion space-faring vessels.
> - The *Encyclopedia of Vhaeso's Tears*, a catalog of the Dominion's subservient races.
> - *The Entrails of Creation*, a mad inscription on ruins outside of [[Absalom]] that depicts the horrific Dominion fleshfarms, nation-sized [[Slavery|slave]] processing facilities that convert living beings toward terrible ends.
> - The *Libram of Absolute Emptiness* and *Mah-Theneg Codices*, purported translations of Dominion writings.
> - The *[[Secrets of the Dreaming Dark]]*, which is thought to provide the means of contacting the Dominion.
> - *[[The Last Theorem]]*, a translated Dominion text that references the Great Old Ones.
> - *Nullity*, a 13-word riddle that ostensibly grants its solver knowledge of all divinity, though all who have solved it have been murdered.

> A major article on the Dominion of the Black is in *[[Valley of the Brain Collectors]]*.
