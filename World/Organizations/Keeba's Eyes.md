> The three otherworldly prophets known as **Keeba's Eyes**, [[Cenabal]], [[Raeke]], and [[Zhaegog]], live in the [[Cauldrons of Calm and Calamity]], a series of mystical caves at the foot of [[Mount Keeba]] on the [[Smoker]] island. The three prophets are famous in the [[Shackles]] for their wisdom and oracular prowess. No one knows their true forms but many pilgrims arrive in [[Plumetown]] seeking words of wisdom from the Eyes. They are informed by the residents that they have to wait there until a [[Caretakers|Caretaker]] seeks them out when one of the Eyes is willing to give an audience. The wait may last from hours to years. When a Caretaker does come to Plumetown with a summons, the silent figure escorts the petitioners on the long, paved road called the [[Wise Artery]] to the Cauldrons of Calm and Calamity. Upon arrival, they are guided to one of Keeba's Eyes, who hears each petitioner's question and names the non-negotiable price for its answer.
