> The **Storm Kindlers** were a fanatical group of priests of [[Gozreh]].
> They viewed the appearance of the [[Eye of Abendego]] as a manifestation of their deity and flocked to the [[Sodden Lands]]. Their leaders wore [[Goz mask|goz masks]], but ultimately even these failed in the face of the unexpected ferocity of the Eye. All of the Storm Kindlers died.
> A second generation cult of followers of Gozreh adopt the name of Storm Kindlers. They also seek to understand the Eye of Abendego. Aware of their precursors' mistakes, this new generation of Storm Kindlers has devised elaborate methods to navigate the storm-lashed Sodden Lands.
