> **House Davian** was one of the noble houses of [[Cheliax]]. They were one of the main houses contending for the throne of Cheliax in the [[Chelish Civil War]] that followed the death of [[Aroden]]. They were supported in this by [[Grallus|Baron Grallus]] of [[Sargava]], who financed them out of the Sargavan treasury. 
> House Davian's ambitions came to an end when they suffered a heavy defeat to [[House Thrune]] at the [[Battle of a Hundred Kings]].
> Many of House Davian's supporters, including [[Venture-Captain]] [[Aiger Ghaelfin]], were later hunted down by a murderous [[Wizard|wizard]] known as Commandra Voxlay.
