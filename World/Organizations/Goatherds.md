> The **Goatherds** are a [[Cheapside]] criminal gang run by [[Zandros|Zandros the Fair]]. They make their headquarters in [[Cheliax]]'s [[Egorian|capital]], in a group of buildings on [[Eel Street]] known locally as the Goat Pen. Formed by Zandros before [[4680 AR]], the gang is fairly plebeian in its goals, focusing on theft, loan sharking, and other petty crimes.
