> The **Order of the Scar** is a nearly-defunct [[Hellknights]] order which focuses on finding and killing [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|assassins]].  Originally founded by [[Gaspodar|King Gaspodar]] of [[Cheliax]] as an act of desperation in the early years of the [[Chelish Civil War]], the Order is thought to now number fewer than forty individuals. They are said to favor the [[Rapier|rapier]] over other [[Weapon|weapons]]. Most of the remaining Hellknights are located in the [[Taldor|Taldan]] city of [[Cassomir]], with the remaining residing in other parts of Taldor and [[Qadira]]. Members of the Order of the Scar survive by hiring themselves out as mercenaries to those who fear the assassin's blade; employers hope to hunt the killers down before becoming victims themselves.
