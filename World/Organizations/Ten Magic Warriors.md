> The **Ten Magic Warriors** were ancestral heroes of the [[Zenj]] tribes of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] and disciples of [[Old-Mage Jatembe]].



## History

> According to legend, there was a great [[Mwangi]] civilization in the Mwangi Expanse, which was wiped out by the fall of the *[[Starstone]]* that ushered in the [[Age of Darkness]]. The Magic Warriors gave up everythingâ€”even their names, known to history only by their golden masks in the forms of fantastic jungle creaturesâ€”to maintain this lost civilization's culture and learning in the disaster's aftermath.
> Jatembe and the Warriors defeated [[Evil|evildoers]] such as the [[King of Biting Ants]], whose stronghold was the [[Doorway to the Red Star]]. They became advisers to and protectors of the people. The Warriors aided Jatembe's creation of the *[[Ring of Nine Facets]]*.


## Members

> The earliest warriors, led by Jatembe, included:

> - Azure Leopard, the Patient Warden, a [[Human|human]] woman and founder of the [[Tempest-Sun Mages]]
> - [[Black Heron]], the Wings of Knowledge, who united the [[Shory]] people into the [[Shory Empire]]
> - Carmine Jaws, the Hyena who Looks Between, who may or may not have been a [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]]
> - Elephant, the Conjured Chronicle, who chronicled the deeds of the warriors and founded the Uzunjati
> - Golden Snake, the Tireless Guide, who was likely a [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]], although some argue he was a [[Nagaji|nagaji]]
> - Ibex, the Flourishing Field, who pioneered [[Medicine|herbal medicine]] and [[Healing|healing]]
> - Shifting Frog, Storyteller of the Past and Future, an [[Ekujae]] [[Elf|elf]]
> - Verdant Spider, the Speaker of Needs, who fought for the rights of ordinary people and inspired the Magaambya's history of service
> - Whistling Kite, the Vigilant Seer, a prominent emancipator always depicted as an intelligent [[Hawk|hawk]]
> - White Bull, the Horn-Forger, an [[Iruxi|iruxi]] known for several prominent achievements in architecture
> Among the Zenj, some [[Arcanist|arcanists]] proffer disputed claims that as many as three of the Ten were themselves arcanists.


## Legacy

> The greatest students of the Warriors founded a center of magical learning in [[-2832 AR]] called the [[Magaambya]]. The Warriors are represented in mosaic on the ten towers of the Magaambya, buthere are no known tombs for any of them.
> Some credit Jatembe and his Warriors with the destruction of [[Ird]], a lost city whose surviving relics paint a picture of a foul and decadent culture.
> The [[Iobane]] consider themselves spiritual successors to the Warriors as they defend the Doorway to the Red Star.
