> The **Wyrmtooth Tribe** is a tribe of [[Taiga giant|taiga giants]] who have abandoned their people's nomadic ways to set up a permanent camp in [[Iobaria|Iobarias]] [[Eastern Ice Steppes]]. The tribe seeks revenge against the [[White dragon|white dragon]] [[Sjohvor]] who killed a half-dozen tribal elders during a conclave centuries ago. Led by the young [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druid]] [[Drugezna]], the Wyrmtooth have easily fended off attacks from [[Frost giant|frost giants]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbaric]] [[Tsolniva]] [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] while they prepare to assault the [[Sjohvornor|dragons lair]].
