> **House Vendikon** controlled the [[Barony of Perin]], a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] barony northwest of the [[Aspodell Crossroads]]. When [[Andoran]] still belonged to Cheliax, all three baronies of the area ([[Barony of Perin]], Barony of Pamiatazova, and Barony of Darkmoon) belonged to the County of Elberwick. [[Galdur Vendikon|Lord Galdur Vendikon]] did not embrace the revolution nor did he join the evil Chelish empire. After the revolution, Lord Vendikon controlled little more than the few miles around his strategically important [[Baron Vendikon's Keep|keep]] in [[Piren's Bluff|Pirens Bluff]].
