>  **Devil's Four** is the name given to the four [[pirate]] captains under the control of the [[Pathfinder]] captain [[Challys Argent]]. Using the power of the [[magical]] [[sword]] Siren Call, Challys placed a *geas* upon four of the most dangerous pirate captains of [[the Shackles]], saving hundreds, if not thousands, from their piratical depredations.
>  The Devil's Four are:

>  - [[Adalbert Aspodell]], also known as "Aspodell the Lash", a former aristocrat who fights with a duellist's elegance while inflicting sadistic injuries with his signature [[rapier]].
>  - [[Otondo]], the bloodthirsty, [[cannibal]] [[Ogre]] captain. Otondo is the size of three men and he wields a specially forged cutlass to cut down swathes of his enemies.
>  - [[Rira]], a pirate queen whose face is hidden by a terrifying, ancient mask fashioned in the likeness of a [[Sahuagin]]. She is an accomplished [[Arcanist]] and she uses her [[spells]] to lethal effect.
>  - [[Seagrave]], a filthy pirate captain whose knowledge of the Shackles is near encyclopedic and was renowned for his utter ruthlessness.
