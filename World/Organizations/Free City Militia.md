> The **Free City Militia**, sometimes termed the **Free City Citizen Militia**, of [[Cettigne]] is the city's traditional and independent guard. Indeed, when the formerly independent city-state was annexed by [[Molthune]], the militia retained its existing role. [[Irina Klim|General Lord Irina Klim]] has orders to deploy it to the front line of Molthune's ongoing conflict with [[Nirmathas]], but its officers have delayed this move with insubordination andâ€”according to Klimâ€”outright sedition. Its members frequently find creative ways to undermine Klim's orders. Klim ordered three of the guard's high-ranking officers, including the charismatic and well-connected [[Xander Bretonne|Guard-Captain Xander Bretonne]], to be imprisoned indefinitely on suspicion of attempting to usurp her rule over Cettigne. Rumours abound that the general lord may soon resort to open violence to ensure the militia's obedience.
