> The **Blades of Aaramor** are a [[Kellid]] tribe who occupy the ancient fortress city of [[Aaramor]] in northern [[Numeria]]. The [[Aaramor person|namesake warlord]] founded the tribe thousands of years ago, and since then they have represented a rare example of a non-nomadic Kellid tribe; they are bound to and have sovereign control over their home through ancient agreements granted by Numeria's [[Black Sovereign]].



## History

> Aaramor's construction was ordered in [[1305 AR]] by legendary Numerian kings and named after the Blades' founder. The city once defended the border against the [[Giant-kin|giant-kin]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Barbarian|barbarians]] of [[Sarkoris]].
> In [[1521 AR]], Aaramor's ruler had its northern stone bridge replaced with a fragile [[Wood|wooden]] bridge to deter [[Giant|giants]] from crossing the [[West Sellen River]].
> After the opening of the Worldwound in [[4606 AR]], Aaramor became Numeria's first line of defense against the [[Demon|demonic]] hordes.


## Goal

> The Blades continue to uphold their end of ancient pacts that charge them with defending Numeria from threats and invasions from their north. In exchange, they collect tribute from residents of the fortress city and its surroundings.


## Structure

> Membership to the Blades is a birthright, but the tribe allows for adoption of outsiders who pledge loyalty to the tribe above all other considerations, including race. The result is a membership that includes [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and [[Half-orc|half-orcs]].
> The tribe is led by Blades of Aaramor [[Rothgar|Chief Rothgar]], who must balance his loyalty to the [[Black Sovereign]], the town's defense, the relationship between the townsfolk and tribe, and the fiscal demands of the [[Technic League]].
> The Blades' rule over the town of Aaramor is a privilege granted by the Black Sovereign, though revoking that privilege would likely spark a civil war.
