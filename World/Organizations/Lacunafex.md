> The **Lacunafex** is a small network of spies and couriers that operate in secret across [[Cheliax]], and are based out of [[Lady Docur's School for Girls|Lady Docurs School for Girls]] located in the [[Villegre]] district of free-spirited [[Kintargo]] in northern Cheliax.
> The school provides both a cover and a recruiting ground for the Lacunafex, as its headmistress [[Mialari Docur|Lady Mialari Docur]] is also the organization's founder. Lady Docur runs the school, which caters almost exclusively to [[Half-elf|half-elven]] girls from across Cheliax, [[Isger]], and [[Molthune]], but secretly recruits her most talented pupils into the Lacunafex, where they are taught spycraft. The organisation was founded on somewhat of a whim, but now works across the nation, and is known to frequently work with the [[Irori|Iroran]] [[Sacred Order of Archivists]].
