> The **House of Thrune** is an ancient noble house of [[Cheliax]] whose adherence to the infernal philosophy of [[Diabolism]] long predates the fall of [[Aroden]]. Members favored black and gothic designs in dress.
> After over 30 years of [[Chelish Civil War|civil war]] following the death of [[Aroden]] in [[4606 AR]], House Thrune seized the throne of Cheliax by promising a return to glory and stability, although at a heavy price. The [[Treaty of Egorian]] was signed on the 19th day of [[Calistril]], [[4640 AR]], marking the [[Thrune Ascendancy]] and commencement of the reign of Queen Abrogail. [[Loyalty Day]] is held  each year on the anniversary of the signing the treaty to honor the Thrune Ascendancy.
> The Thrune Ascendancy brought changes to both Cheliax and its history. Major portions of Cheliax history prior to that time have been expunged by the agents of House Thrune. New histories are produced every three months and the [[Order of the Rack]] have made it their responsibility to ensure that libraries and universities have the most up to date copies, burning the old editions in so called 'clarity pyres'.
> The armies of House Thrune are supplemented with the bound denizens of [[Hell]] and they remain close allies of the various orders of [[Hellknights]]. Nobles from the House of Thrune regularly enter into dark pacts with infernal agents in return for incredible power. Other noble house have followed House Thrune's lead in this practice.


## Line of succession

> There is no law to limit the line of succession in the ruling House of Thrune and a number of internal factions and clans within the house scheme and maneuver for power, seeking to place their chosen candidate upon the throne. As of [[4709 AR]], the head of House Thrune, and monarch of the empire of Cheliax was [[Abrogail Thrune II|Abrogail II]], the sixth member of the house to wear the crown since the establishment of their dynasty.
