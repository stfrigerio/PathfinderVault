> The **Haskodar tribe**, or **Haskodar Clan**, of [[Orc|orcs]] wars for control of the city of [[Blisterwell]] with the [[One Eye tribe]]. The clan is led by [[Tulluk Clovenface]] who hates deeply [[Molkk Dwarf-Mangler]], the leader of the One Eye tribe. Tulluk is supported in his war with the One Eye tribe by the clan [[Shamanism|shaman]], [[Ysok Rockcaller]]. The Haskodar are not originally from the [[Hold of Belkzen]], they are in fact a [[Darklands]] orc tribe. They emerged onto the surface in [[4701 AR]] as part of a truce with their long-time rivals, the [[Duergar|duergar]] of [[Fellstrok]]. Having long warred across [[Nar-Voth]] with the duergar, the Haskodar tribe agreed to peace in exchange for large amounts of [[Slaves|slaves]] and high-quality duergar [[Weapon|weapons]] and [[Armour|armour]]. [[Brithuan|War Marshal Brithuan]] granted the Haskodar this in exchange for them attacking and conquering the orc surface city of Blisterwell. Unbeknownst to the Haskodar tribe, War Marshal Brithuan plans to use Blisterwell as a beachhead in his effort to destabilise [[Grask Uldeth|Grask Uldeths]] control of [[Urgir]], hopefully allowing him to place an orc puppet on the throne and allowing him to expand his [[Slavery|slaving]] operation.
> The renowned [[Half-orc|half-orc]] [[Warpriest|warpriest]] [[Adventurer|adventurer]], [[Oloch]], was also a member of the Haskodar tribe before venturing out on his own.
