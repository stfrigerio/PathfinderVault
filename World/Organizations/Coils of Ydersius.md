> The **Coils of Ydersius** is an organization dedicated to the [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]] [[Demigod|demigod]] [[Ydersius deity|Ydersius]], and the return of the serpentfolk civilization to greatness. Although some believe that the god is dead, members of the cult are aware that he is not, although it is generally believed that he is divided into two sections: a skull-like head, and a still living body.  The Coils of Ydersius hope to bring about his and the serpentfolk's triumphant return to the surface of [[Golarion]]. The serpentfolk themselves are believed to be asleep somewhere, waiting to be woken up. Some [[Human|human]] members believe that they are the reincarnated spirits of ancient serpentfolk, although it is unknown whether this is actually the case.
