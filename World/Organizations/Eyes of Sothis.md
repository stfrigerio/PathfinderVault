> The **Eyes of Sothis** is the name of [[Sothis]]' city guard. The Commander of the Eyes of Sothis is also the First Captain of the [[Risen Guard]].  He who holds these titles drops his name and former identity and adopts the name of his weapon. The leader becomes a weapon whose sole role it is to protect the [[Pharaoh|pharaoh]] and the capital Sothis, the heart of [[Osirion]]. Currently these titles, and the leadership of the organization, are held by the [[Khopeshman of Sothis]] who has taken them up from the [[Spearwoman of Sothis]] in [[4704 AR]].
