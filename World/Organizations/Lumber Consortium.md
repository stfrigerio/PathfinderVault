> The **Lumber Consortium** is a company which has a monopoly on the hardwood and [[Darkwood|darkwood]] lumber industry in the country of [[Andoran]]. A remnant of the past when Andoran existed as a [[Cheliax|Chelish]] holding, the Lumber Consortium has seen its wealth and influence decline with the coming of democracy. Nonetheless, the Lumber Consortium continues to exert great pressure on smaller and weaker regions and communities, particularly in the less developed areas of the nation. The Consortium's major logging operation occurs in and around [[Darkmoon Vale]], and as such, this is where their continued power is most noticeable.



## History

> The Lumber consortium was founded in the year [[1853 AR]], to provide a steady supply of lumber to [[Taldor]].
> But little is known of the Consortium before [[Barenddo Novotnian]] founded the city of [[Olfden]] in [[4128 AR]] as the first lumber town in the [[Darkmoon Vale]] region. Novotnian lumberjacks provided wood to [[Oregent]], where Barenddo's business partner, Lord Rene Rakesclaw, owned the necessary sawmills. Lumber was sent off to [[Augustana]]. There were many chefs involved in the lumber stew.
> Rene's grandson, Tarris Rakesclaw, bought out Novotnian, headed up a partnership and established a lumber organization focused on efficiency and profits, not employee welfare, in [[4139 AR]]. Rakesclaw's efforts were very successful and he bought out competitors and vendors and donated generously to the Chelaxian Empire.
> In the ensuing three centuries, the Lumber Consortium was unstoppable. Government-run operations were privatized (lobbied for by the Consortium) and absorbed. Privately operated competitors were taken over, be they lumber companies, sawmills or barge operations. The Consortium had a complete monopoly when the Thrice Damned [[House of Thrune]] took power in [[Cheliax]].
> Not a big fan of anybody holding power but themselves, the Thrune government tried to legislate the Lumber Consortium out of business. Years passed and the Consortium's power and control decreased. Then [[Andoran]] rose up and declared independence from Cheliax and the Consortium's Board saw a golden opportunity. They supported the new government and came to a mutually agreeable arrangement, though both sides distrust the other, as the Consortium's management style is in direct opposition to Andoran's principles of liberty.

## Structure

> The Lumber Consortium is controlled by a board of directors in Oregent, all of whom possess a controlling share of the company. They oversee the operations of the organization, laying out the long-term, large-scale strategies and leaving the day-to-day management to on-site foremen known as **gavels**. At its height, the Consortium had over a dozen, but currently employs only three gavels: [[Thuldrin Kreed]], [[Cedrog Deadknuckle]], and Rhyma Bloodthorn. No one rises to power within the Lumber Consortium without making their fortunes on the backs of lumberjacks and at the expense of the forests and native civilians. Though they have never been known for their kind hearts or straight morals, members of the board have become increasingly sadistic and cruel as their power has eroded. Hushed rumors even tie a few of the directors to the mysteriously sinister [[Aspis Consortium]].
> The board consists of:

> - Jemi Arkona of [[Augustana]]
> - Gol Ephialtes of [[Almas]]
> - Garland Rakesclaw in [[Oregent]]
> - Miastrano Festulian in Oregent
> - Bocha Wade in Oregent
> - Marson Trabe in Oregent
> - Chozan Korpuls in Oregent
> - Maxinarius Kollepolis in Almas
> The company employs 600 lumberjacks, 400 security guards, 300 millwrights, 200 laborers, 150 clerks, 100 blacksmiths, and 100 other.


## Notable members

> [[Thuldrin Kreed]] is the gavel in the Darkmoon Vale region, and his sadistic and cruel ways keep the town of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] subservient to his every hateful whim. As a gavel, Kreed has absolute control over the consortium's presence in Darkmoon Vale, including its employees and hard assets. His only true job is to continue increasing profits for the company every year, something which has become harder year after year. As long as this happens, the board turns its eye from all of his misdeeds. In fact, Kreed has been saved from a hangman's noose on numerous occasions, thanks to the work of the Consortium's well-paid barristers.
> [[Cedrog Deadknuckle]] is the other current Gavel. He oversees the city of Oregent in Andoran.
> [[Bruiser Tor]] is the Lumber Consortium Enforcer in the large city of Oregent.
