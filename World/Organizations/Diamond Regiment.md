> The **Diamond Regiment** is an [[Andoran|Andoren]] army group consisting of about 388 regular army soldiers alongside 12 [[Eagle Knights]]. They are based out of the tower of [[Adamas]]. The primary function of the regiment is to ensure that shipments of [[Darkwood|darkwood]] travel through the area safely on their way to the Andoran shipyards. The regiment is headed by Commander [[Ingrid Odeber]], a [[Paladin|paladin]] of [[Iomedae]].  Through her, it has ties to the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of the [[Greenfire Circle]] with which the regiment cooperates.
> The insignia of the regiment is a gold patch with a black and grey silhouette of a [[Falcon|falcon]] carrying a sword.  At the bottom tip of the patch is a red (denoting sacrifice) diamond.
