> The **Rats of Karneik** are a pack of [[Giant rat|giant rats]] led by a rat king that has historically preyed upon the poorly defended town of [[Chastel]] in the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] county of [[Lozeri]]. Taking advantage of the town's lack of defensive walls, the giant rats have long preyed upon its stockyards and marketplace.
