> The **Ninth Battalion** is an inter-clan group of [[Dwarf|dwarf]] warriors dedicated to defend the remaining dwarven enclaves in [[Golarion]]. When enemies threaten a clan home, the Ninth Battalion will soon be there, answering the call for aid. It was founded and still led by [[Charak Helmrunner|General Charak Helmrunner]]. The headquarters of the group is the [[Earth Axle]], a massive stone fortress constructed on an island at the center of a mountain lake, and said to be close to a [[Sky Citadel]]. The Ninth Battalion also focuses on forging excellent [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]] and [[Weapon|weapons]] for its members, including its unique *tunnel defender stoneplate* armor.
