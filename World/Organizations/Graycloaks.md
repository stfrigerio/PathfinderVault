> The **Graycloaks** are the district guard for [[Absalom|Absaloms]] [[Ascendant Court]] district, and are tasked with keeping the peace in the polytheistic neighborhood. Their membership requires denying divine authority of all deities so as to hold the laws of Absalom above all and their public atheism ensures their impartial reputation in conflict between believers. They believe gods exist, divine magic being the most obvious proof of them, but see them simply as very powerful beings, unworthy of adoration.
> The Graycloaks have a relatively flat organizational structure. All assignments are handled by the captain, [[Runewulf the Unbeliever]], (cousin of [[Estrid the White]]) or his immediate lieutenants. They are well known for their dedication to acquiring all the information they can before taking action, arranging elaborate sting operations on their targets.


## Dress

> Like their name implies, members of the Greycloaks dress in simple, gray woolen cloaks over their standard uniform without any symbol or identifying marker. This lack of insignia is yet another proof that no religion holds any sway over them, an important characteristic in a district known for extreme religious plurality. It has the additional benefit of helping them blend into crowds.
