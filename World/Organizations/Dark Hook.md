> **Dark Hook** is a [[Goblin|goblin]] tribe that inhabit the [[Raingale Isle]] along the northern edge of the [[Shackles]]. The goblins imitate [[Human|human]] [[Pirate|pirates]]. Their [[Ship|ships]] often seem more like mounds of debris than actual vessels, but prove surprisingly adept and occasionally manage to take down merchant ships.
