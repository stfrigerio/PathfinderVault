> **Oasis** is the name of a secret society of rebels who oppose the tyranny of the [[Water Lord Ular Kel|Water Lords]] who rule [[Ular Kel]]. While many chafe under the Water Lords rule, Oasis recruits only the most dedicated dissenters, those willing to use violence to oppose Ular Kel's tyrannical rule. Despite most citizens avoiding discussing politics, the phrase "Even their trees drink first" (in reference to the lush gardens the Water Lords maintain atop the [[Water Houses]], while the poorest citizens struggle to access water) has come to be commonly used to bemoan the rampant nepotism and corruption of the Water Lords.
