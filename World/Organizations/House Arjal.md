> **House Arjal** was the ruling house of [[New Iobaria]]. Descended from one of the three warlords who in [[3212 AR]] lead the Restoration War to rescue the realm of [[Iobaria]] from foreign powers, House Arjal would eventually betray its ally House Narkys to the [[Dragon|dragons]] of Iobaria's mountains to gain the dragons' allegiance. Later, House Arjal would enter into a feud with house House Korya, which resulted in House Korya and its allies fleeing west into the lands that would one day become [[Brevoy]].
> After the collapse of [[New Iobaria]], [[House Rhukov]] of [[Mirnbay]] has become the last remaining faction of the once-great House Arjal.
