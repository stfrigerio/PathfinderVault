> The **Triunes of Lambreth** was the ruling council of the small domain of [[Lambreth]], in the [[River Kingdoms]]. Lambreth was formed in [[4502 AR]] from the union of the three important merchant families in the area: the [[Cullerton family|Cullertons]], the [[Angelidis family|Angelidis]], and the [[Vizcarra family|Vizcarra]], who founded the tiny city-states of [[Maashinelle]], [[Lockridge]], and [[Sezgin]], respectively. The union was the result of 10 years of delicate negotiations between the three families and was proposed by [[Leeoda Cullerton]]. It gathered together all of the isolated villages between the [[West Sellen River]] and the Tolemaida River to the east.
> When Lambreth was threatened by imminent invasion from neighbouring [[Razmiran]] in [[4675 AR]], the Triune, in desperation, offered the lordship of the realm to [[Kamdyn Arnefax]].
