*See also: [[Arclord of Nex]]*
> The **Arclords of Nex** are one of the factions that have been fighting for control of the nation of [[Nex]] since the disappearance of the archmage [[Nex (person)|Nex]] in [[576 AR]]. They consider that the current unofficial peace with the neighbouring nation of [[Geb's Rest]] would displease the archmage.



## Goals

> They claim to be descended from Nex's household servants, and seek to further Nex's wishes in the modern world. They identify his opinions based on their interpretation of the various diaries, notes, and [[Scroll|scrolls]] that Nex left behindâ€”although some of these works are of dubious authenticity.
> One of their more esoteric abilities (since copied by others in Nex) is the power to open a third eye on the forehead, granting increased perception of the magical world.


## History

> The Arclords of Nex founded the prestigious school of magic, the [[Arcanamirium]], in [[Absalom]].
> At one time, several centuries after the archmage's disappearance, the Arclords managed to gain control of the country, reinitializing hostilities with [[Geb's Rest]] while hoarding any scrap of information regarding their lost master. This did not end well for the Arclords, and they fell from grace and were eventually exiled, settling on the isle of [[Jalmeray]]. They were driven out of Jalmeray by rajas of [[Vudra]] in [[2822 AR]]. Angered by their humiliation the remaining Arclords unleashed the [[Conjured Siege]] on [[Absalom]]. Using charmed, summoned and constructed forces, the Arclords besieged the city in [[2850 AR]], but were eventually driven off.


## Structure

> The current leader of the Arclords of Nex is the archmage [[Agrellus Kisk]], who has a senior position on Nex's ruling [[Council of Three and Nine]].
> 
Other members:

> - [[Ambellek Dyr]].

### Symbol

> The symbol used by the Arclords of Nex is that of an eye within a triangle.


### Favored familiar

> The Arclords, and their affiliates at the Arcanamirium in Absalom, prefer exotic and clever [[Familiar|familiars]], such as [[Archaeopteryx|archaeopteryxes]], [[Homunculus|homunculi]], [[Rhamphorhynchus|rhamphorhynchuses]], [[Tuatara|tuataras]].
