> The **Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye** (rarely known as the **Eldritch Order of the Palatine Eye**) is a secretive organization of scholars and historians based in [[Ustalav]]. Their mission is to study and monitor dangerous lore and inhuman monsters, and their primary antagonists are the cultists of the [[Whispering Way]] and the [[Night Heralds]]. Since [[Tar-Baphon|Tar-Baphons]] re-emergence in [[4719 AR]], the Order's opposition to the Whispering Way has become increasingly direct and in the open, a change that disturbs some of its older members. Their primary identifying symbol is a golden scarab.



## History

> In [[4063 AR]], the Order aided those responsible for defeating the [[Blue dragon|blue dragon]] [[Kazavon]], who had set himself as a warlord in [[Belkzen]].

## Members

> Members of the Order are deeply enmeshed in political and arcane matters and are sworn to guard Ustalav and its ancient traditions. One of the main written works of the Order is the *[[Manual of the Order of the Palatine Eye]]*, which is adorned with the symbol of the Order: a [[Scarab beetle|scarab beetle]] with a single eye image on its back.
> Members once communicated with each other through coded messages and symbols that hold special meaning, but have become less careful since the Whispering Tyrant freed himself from imprisonment in [[Gallowspire]].


### True silvered thrones

> Those who ascend to the upper echelons of the Order are known as **true silvered thrones**. Such [[Shaman|shamanistic]] scholars embrace the [[Occult|occult]] and are masters of occult [[Ritual|rituals]].


### Favored familiars

> [[Cat|Cats]], [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Bat|bats]], [[Greensting scorpion|greensting scorpions]], and [[Toad|toads]] all have [[Occult|occult]] connections that draw members of the Order to select them as [[Familiar|familiars]], while [[Pseudosphinx|pseudosphinxes]] and [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]] attract those with specific interest in [[Osirion]].


> There is a major article about this organization in *[[Trial of the Beast]]* 70*ff.* and an article in *[[Disciple's Doctrine|Disciples Doctrine]]* 8*f.*
