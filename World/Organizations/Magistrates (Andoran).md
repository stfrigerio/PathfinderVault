> The **magistrates** of [[Andoran]] are judicial officers who are appointed by the government's ruling body, the [[People's Council|Peoples Council]], to argue the law and interpret its constitution, known as the [[Associative Act]]. They are members of the government who are subordinate to the members of the People's Council when it comes to purely political issues.


## Responsibilities

> In addition to arguing and interpreting Andoren law, magistrates also have the ability to call local public meetings called moots. On rare occasions, magistrates may also be called on to serve as Andoren dignitaries abroad, and are always protected by members of the [[Steel Falcons]] when doing so.
