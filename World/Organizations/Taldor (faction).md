> The **Taldor faction** within the [[Pathfinder Society]] represented the interests of [[Taldor]] as it struggled to solidify its standing in the [[Inner Sea region]].



## Background

> [[Taldor|Old Taldor]] once ruled the entire northern coast of the [[Inner Sea]], from gold gilded [[Oppara]] to the wild frontier of [[Varisia]]. Now it's reduced to a quarter of its former glory. As Old Taldor's gaze turned ever inward, its vassals and conquered colonies slowly slipped away without a fight. [[Andoran]] and [[Cheliax]] broke off hundreds of years ago, and few in Taldor had either the desire or the motivation to go to war to stop it. Why bother dealing with petty trifles in the countryside when your own political destruction is taking place in the lime light of Taldan high society?
> It's easy to forget Taldor's former glory and dismiss the entire country as a band of narcissistic fools who spend more time preening their wigs than they do defending their borders or quelling the unrest roiling within their great cities. Little do most know that while the majority of Taldor's upper crust are more concerned with this season's fashions than the well being of their collapsing empire, a few of the world's most dangerous operatives are honed in the constant battleground of Oppara's feuds. Old enmities between ancient houses have engulfed the Gilded City in shadowy violence and assassinations for hundreds of years, and more than a fair share of skilled adventurers have come up surviving the feuds, either as hired muscle or scions of noble houses mixed up in these simmering cauldrons of bloodshed.
> Taldans are decadent bon vivants, favoring rich foods, ornate attire, and jeweled accoutrements for even the most minor of casual affairs. To a Taldan, appearance is an expression of power, and a keen sense of fashion represents a keen mind. Their appreciation for the arts extends beyond fashion and painting, dabbling in sorcery, dueling, and the murky strategies of politics and war. A Taldan mind, when raised to ire, is a dangerous thing, and the rest of the Inner Sea is about to receive a painful reminder of this timeless fact.


## Goals: Get Back in the Game

> Petty differences and ancient feuds have slowly ground Taldor down from a great polished stone to a whittled nub. The key to restoring the empire's sense of purpose lies in finding an enemy to galvanize Taldor's splintered factions, an endeavor worthy of rediscovering the nation's august past glory. Seizing the political reins of [[Absalom]] is the perfect medicine for the wasting disease deep in Taldor's bones.


## Methodology: Wolf and Tiger

> Taldor's strategy for seizing control of Absalom lies in turning its enemies against one another. Misdirection and psychological warfare are the orders of the day. Taldan missions involve sparking old enmities between [[Qadira]] and [[Osirion]], driving Cheliax and Andoran to rekindle their old war. "Sick the wolf on the tiger and the hunter's work is done" is an old Taldan saying, and the mantra by which Taldor's agents create havoc around the Inner Sea.


## Leadership

> [[Gloriana Morilla|Lady Gloriana Morilla]] succeeded [[Jacquo Dalsine|Baron Jacquo Dalsine]] after his death in [[4711 AR]].


## Retirement

> Lady Gloriana Morilla formed the [[Sovereign Court faction|Sovereign Court]] after the [[Year of the Demon]] to unify Taldan nobles and rally them into a more active group for Taldor's advancement.
