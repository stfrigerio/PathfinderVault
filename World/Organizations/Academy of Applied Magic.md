> The **Academy of Applied Magic** in [[Pezzack]] focuses on pragmatic [[Magic|magical]] skills, training artisans to create [[Magic item|magic items]], [[Potion|potions]], and [[Scroll|scrolls]]. Rather than teach [[Spell|spells]] useful to [[Adventurer|adventurers]] or in combat, its faculty teaches utilitarian magic for construction and infrastructure. The school continues to function despite the town's years-long blockade by the [[Chelish Navy]].



## Structure

> [[Sanda Malferixian]] leads the academy as headmaster, though she is openly desperate to convince any qualified student or [[Wizard|wizard]] to take over the school.


## Members

> - [[Kalizandrex Poppo]], professor

## Sites

> The Academy is housed in western Pezzack, across from the ruined Glass on the Hill theater.
