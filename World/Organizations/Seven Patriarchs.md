> The **Seven Patriarchs** are the legendary and secretive rulers of the [[Duergar|duergar]] race. They issue their decrees from the secluded fortress of [[Diepkamer]] in the [[Darklands]] region of [[Nar-Voth]], and duergar leaders occasionally travel there to consult with them.
> They are said to be the first duergar to worship [[Droskar]], who granted them immortality as a reward. The duergar believe they commune with the god and their proclamations amount to divine law.
> However, five of the seven Patriarchs have died within the past few years in mysterious circumstances, much to the consternation of the folk of Diepkamer. So far the remaining two have kept this a secret from the duergar of the wider world, and they are frantically seeking a reason for the deaths.
