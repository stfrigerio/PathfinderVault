> The **Accressiel Court** is a [[Fey|fey]] court that rules over the [[Southern Fangwood]]. It was founded by and is once again ruled by the [[Glaistig|glaistig]] [[Gendowyn]].


## History

> The Southern Fangwood has had a history of connections with the [[First World]] since before recorded history, when [[Elf|elves]] settled the forest during the [[Age of Legend]]. Gendowyn formed the Accressiel Court and became its queen in [[-3852 AR]], about 150 years after [[Kellid]] clans began claiming parts of the woods as their territory; within [[-3850 AR|two years]], the clans declared the forest forbidden after rumors of hauntings spread among the tribes.
> In [[-3701 AR]], Gendowyn established contact with one of the tribe's chieftains, named [[Ilba]], and negotiated an alliance with him. This agreement would last for more than 6,000 years, until the march of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] brought ruin to the Fangwood's doorstep. The alliance was broken when Gendowyn reluctantly decided to abandon the tribes just as they came under assault from the Whispering Tyrant's forces in [[3203 AR]]. Instead of lending their support, the court retreated deeper into the Fangwood and [[Magic|magically]] hid themselves from the Tyrant's forces.
> Years after the Tyrant's [[Gallowspire|imprisonment]], and after the [[Rending]] shattered [[Dwarf|dwarven]] culture in the region, Gendowyn once again reached out to the material world beyond the Fangwood to establish an alliance with the [[Sky Citadel]] of [[Kraggodan]]. This relationship was cut short by the spread of the [[Darkblight]] at the hands of the corrupted [[Dryad|dryad]] [[Arlantia]] in [[4062 AR]]. The Accressiel Court failed to contain the blight, and Arlantia imprisoned Gendowyn, leaving Kraggodan to erect stone monoliths in an attempt to contain the blight's spread.
> In [[4717 AR]], Arlantia was killed by [[Nirmathas|Nirmathi]] militia leaders, and Gendowyn once again rose to take control of the Accressiel Court.


## Relationships

> Gendowyn now seeks allies to help her deal with the remaining pockets of Darkblight and with the [[Orc|orcs]], [[Dragon|dragons]], and other foes living in the Fangwood that kill the fey on sight. She has established relations with the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of [[Crystalhurst]] and with the Nirmathi [[Chernasardo Rangers]]. As these relationships are tenuous at best, the fey queen welcomes any potential allies skilled in negotiation or [[Primal magic|primal magic]].
