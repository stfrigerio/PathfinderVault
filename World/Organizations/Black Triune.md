> The **Black Triune** are the rulers of the nation of [[Nidal]] and are based in its capital of [[Pangolais]]. No longer fully [[Human|human]] and caught between [[Mortal|mortal]] life and [[Undeath|undeath]], the membership of the council has remained unchanged since the beginning of the [[Age of Darkness]] in [[-5293 AR]], and none has sought to challenge their authority in all those years. The will of the Triune is enforced by [[Mykos Roarik|General Mykos Roarik]] and his [[Adamant Company]], who carry out their wishes with brutal and unswerving loyalty. All three members of the Triune are also members of the [[Umbral Court]], Nidal's ruling body.


## History

> Following the devastation of [[Earthfall]] in -5293 AR, the tribal leaders of what is now Nidal prayed to the [[Deity|gods]] to deliver their people from extinction. They were heard by the newly freed [[Zon-Kuthon]], who had recently emerged from his exile to the [[Plane of Shadow]] somewhere near modern-day [[Ridwan]]. The Midnight Lord offered his protection in return for their eternal servitude and that of their descendants. The leaders agreed and were transformed into the Black Triune.


## Members

> The Black Triune consists of a [[Cavalier|cavalier]] and [[Sentinel prestige class|sentinel]] of Zon-Kuthon, a [[Mechanics/Rules/traits/ranger|ranger]] and [[Exalted|exalted]] of Zon-Kuthon, and a [[Witch|witch]] and [[Evangelist prestige class|evangelist]] of Zon-Kuthon. Their true identities are virtually unknown; all three have carefully erased all records of their lives, no one knows their names, they rarely appear in public, and they usually obscure their identities with shadow [[Magic|magic]] in private audiences. Scholars who try to learn too much often meet grisly ends at the hands of the Black Triune's agents.
