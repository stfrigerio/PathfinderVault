> The **Mammoth Lords**â€”a term used not as a rank but to collectively refer to all of its membersâ€”are a collective of nomadic [[Kellid]] tribal groups that roam their frigid, hostile [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords|namesake realm]] in central northern [[Avistan]].

## Structure

*See also: [[Following]]*
> At its most granular level, the Mammoth Lords are comprised of Kellid tribes as small as a few families in number. These tribes form larger groups called [[Following|followings]], which themselves can include hundreds of tribes. A following is when two or more tribes join together to follow a particularly powerful warrior or leader, known as a [[Herder|herder]], who has proven themselves through acts of great courage, strength, or guile, and is backed by a following's most prominent family.
> When a herder dies, often while attempting another epic feat to impress their followers, each tribe of their following either elects to either follow a new hero who must have achieved similarly spectacular feats, split into their original family tribes, or try to join another following.


### Known followings

> There are normally anywhere between 10 and 30 large followings at any one time. There are also typically around 200 smaller followings comprised of only a couple of tribes banding together for survival's sake, or are outcast families or bandits.
> The most prominent followings include:

> - **[[Bearpelt following]]**: The largest and most powerful following numbers in the thousands, makes its winter home southeast of [[Icestair]], and is led by [[Kuldor|Mighty Kuldor]].
> - **Flameblood following**: These nomads of the northwestern Realm near Icestair are considered subversively modern and open. They prosper through trade with [[Po La]] and are led by Urif Flameblood.
> - **[[Greattusk following]]**
> - **[[Ice Chasm following]]**
> - **Night Hunt following**
> - **[[Raptorscale following]]**
> - **[[Slothjaw following]]**
> The **Six Bears following** is considered deceased, though its traditions live on through its former grand matron, [[Omak|Great Mother Omak]].
