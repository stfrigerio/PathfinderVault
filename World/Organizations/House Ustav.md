> **House Ustav** was the royal family which ruled [[Ustalav]] from its founding in the 24th century AR, until the coming of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] in [[3203 AR]]. Descended from the country's founder, [[Soividia Ustav]], this [[Varisian]] family was destroyed in the long, dark years of the [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lichs]] rule. The monarchs of House Ustav ruled with absolute power over the squabbling Ustalavic noble houses of that country until [[2862 AR]], when [[Kaldemov|King Kaldemov]] divided the country into sixteen semi-autonomous counties, owing allegiance to the crown.
