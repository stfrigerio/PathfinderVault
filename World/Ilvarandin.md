> The Vault of **Ilvarandin** is located in [[Orv]], deepest of the levels of the [[Darklands]]. The entire cavern is a single, gigantic city that is largely uninhabited, earning it the title of the **Mute Metropolis**. At the heart of the Vault lies a relatively small section that is inhabited named [[High Ilvarandin]], and is the center of [[Intellect devourer|intellect devourer]] culture in the Darklands. It is perhaps best known on the surface world through the poem [[Songs at Sun's Ebb|Ilvarandin]] by [[Vumeshki]].



## History

> The city is incredibly ancient—some believe it was built by the [[Vault Keepers]] themselves. Its buildings have been built in a number of [[Architectural|architectural]] styles, some of which are apparently unique, but having an ancient [[Azlanti]] character. It consists of gigantic plazas, small, winding streets, high towers, domes, and arched bridges.
> During [[Earthfall]], a group of surface [[Elf|elves]] took refuge in the western part of the ruins, but fell prey to intellect devourers of High Ilvarandin. A handful of elves escaped to the surface and spread tales of Ilvarandin's horrors. The intellect devourers have since adopted more subtle tactics, spreading word that Ilvarandin is a subterranean utopia in order to try to lure fresh victims to the city. However, they also attracted unwanted attention. The [[Neothelid|neothelids]] of [[Denebrum]] have resolved to destroy the intellect devourers, and their army is now encamped in the northeastern district.


## Geography

> The Vault of Ilvarandin is hundreds of miles wide, and is bisected by the [[Irikusk River]]. To its north lies the Vault of [[Denebrum]], the [[Midnight Mountains]] are to the east, [[Doga-Delloth]] to the south, and the [[Sightless Sea]] to the west. In surface-world terms, it is located beneath northwestern [[Cheliax]]. The entire Vault is lit by phosphorescent spores that hang high in the air above the abandoned city.


### Districts

> As Ilvarandin is a largely uninhabited city the size of a country, it can usefully be broken down into nine major districts, each with its own architectural style and varied inhabitants.


#### Ajamote

> The collapsed district of Ajamote is inhabited by [[Gug|gugs]], making this passage to the Midnight Mountains a risky endeavor.


#### Aumentral

> This region is now controlled by the armies of the [[Neothelid|neothelids]]. Its varied architecture is a mix of old [[Garund|Garundi]] styles and primitive stone buildings. Its main features are a vast chasm and a [[Fungal|fungal]] swamp.
> The main inhabitants are the minions of the neothelids—[[Seugathi|seugathi]] and [[Worm that walks|worms that walk]]. However, there are also [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] in the chasm, who sometimes risk the dangerous depths to recover [[Gemstone|gemstones]] of great quality. They claim the depths of the rift are incredibly hot, and home to monstrous [[Ghorazagh|ghorazaghs]].
> A strange fungal version of the [[Shambling mound|shambling mound]] can be found in the fungal swamp. These creatures often carry other dangerous fungi, such as [[Hazards of GolarionYellow mold|yellow mold]].


#### Duskport

***Main article: [[Duskport]]***
> The waterfront district of Duskport stands on the Irikusk River where it meets the Sightless Sea. Its inhabitants include [[Drow|drow]], [[Duergar|duergar]], [[Tiefling|tieflings]], [[Mongrelman|mongrelfolk]], and [[Human|humans]]. There is a temple here to the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Socothbenoth]]. The district is a gateway to trade across the Sightless Sea, and is ruled by a mysterious figure known as the [[Rakehell]].


#### Otha-Thola

> The district of Otha-Thola also stands on the shores of the Sightless Sea, and is south of Duskport. The architecture here is mainly in elven style and extends into the sea, where [[Lacedon|lacedons]] have settled. [[Alghollthu|Alghollthus]] and enslaved [[Skum|skum]] live in the shallow water, while free skum live on land. There is a tall plateau in the southern part of the district, which is home to a tribe of mongrelfolk.


#### Scales

> The eastern district is known as the Scales, named after the [[Diseases of GolarionScales|disease]] of the same name, which is rife in the district. Much of the architecture is in the [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]] style, but there are also massive ruins in the southeast in the style of the [[Cyclopes|cyclopes]]. The inhabitants of this region are fearsome gugs, led by four large specimens which are actually hosts for intellect devourers.


#### Urkalla

> The architecture of this region is in the [[Troglodyte|troglodyte]] style. It is currently controlled by [[Urdefhan|urdefhans]] who have scavenged the buildings for materials to build their fortress of Irith-Arnakian. It is ruled by the warlord [[Vilthanter]], who ensures the safe passage of merchants.


#### Warrens

> The Warrens is Ilvarandin's southern mountain district. The architecture varies, but the two most common styles are [[Dwarf|dwarven]] and the style of ancient [[Thassilon]]. There are few intelligent creatures here, but the most common are the [[Dero|dero]], svirfneblin, and duergar. Its main feature is the Builder's Mark, a massive crater three miles in diameter. Great stairs lead down to the bottom of the crater, which appears to hold nothing of interest. According to legend, there is a secret entrance somewhere down there which leads to the personal domain of one of the Vault Builders. The dero mine the crater floor but their progress is hampered by a strange black sludge that seeps into their tunnels; they cart this away and use it to make [[Clay golem|clay golems]].


#### High Ilvarandin

***Main article: [[High Ilvarandin]]***
> In contrast to the rest of the city, [[High Ilvarandin]] is full of life. Unfortunately, it is life dominated by the intellect devourers.


## Trade

> The intellect devourers are avid consumers of luxury goods, and have a thriving trade with the [[Denizen of Leng|Denizens of Leng]]; the black [[Ship|ships]] of [[Leng]] are a familiar sight in [[Duskport]] (Ilvarandin's main access to the Sightless Sea), and on the Irikusk River. Other races also trade in Duskport, and land-borne trade mainly arrives from the south, via the district of Urkalla.
