> The legendary hero [[Arustun]] recorded everything he saw and learned during his quest of civilization around the [[Inner Sea]] and the [[Outer Sphere]], as well as the legends of his people, in his extensive journals; these were later to be collectively known as the ***Poleiheira***. Arustun returned home from his odyssey in [[-4120 AR]] and founded the [[Jistka Imperium]], the first [[Human|human]] civilization after the [[Earthfall]]. The early government of the Jistka Imperium was based on the *Poleiheira*.
> Sections of *Poleiheira* were condemned by the rulers of [[Rahadoum]] and are now encrypted and known as the *Yemalan Codex*. Remnants of these have been broken into several folios and are in the hands of various collectors.
