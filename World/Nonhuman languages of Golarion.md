> Although there are many [[Human languages of Golarion|human languages]] across [[Golarion]], there are many more of nonhuman origin. Some of them have existed longer than [[Humanity|humanity]] itself.


## Adlet

> The language of the [[Adlet|adlet]], a snow-wolf-like [[Humanoid|humanoid]] species.


## Alghollthu

> The language of [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]], also known as the **Aboleth** language, is one of the oldest on the face (and below the waters) of Golarion. It is spoken by the various species of alghollthus as well as some of their traditional enemies.


## Amurrun

> In addition to [[Taldane]], most [[Catfolk|catfolk]] also speak their own language, called "Amurrun", which is also the term they use for themselves. Amurrun is spoken widely in the large community of catfolk living in the [[Valashmai Jungle]]. As the language of catfolk, this language is sometimes also referred to as **Catfolk**.


## Arboreal

> The language of [[Arboreal|arboreals]] and other [[Plant|plant-like creatures]] is presumably used during moots. [[Arboreal regent|Arboreal regents]] are also known as "treants", so this language is sometimes also referred to as **Treant**.


## Boggard

> This language of croaks and belched pops is spoken by the [[Boggard|boggards]] of the [[Mushfens]] in [[Varisia]].  A crude pidgin of it is also spoken by [[Marsh giant|marsh giants]], and is supposedly even more disgusting to hear.


## Ceratioidi

> The language of the [[Ceratioidi|ceratioidi]].


## Cyclops

> The language of the [[Cyclops|cyclops]] was also once spoken by [[Giant|giants]]. It developed before the coming of humans, among the cyclops of the legendary realm of [[Ghol-Gan]].


## Draconic

> It is believed that Draconic is among the oldest, if not the oldest language of the [[Great Beyond|multiverse]]. Because of this, nearly all other languages can trace some roots back to this primordial tongue. Draconic is one of the two major languages spoken on the [[Planet|planet]] [[Triaxus]], and is commonly spoken in the [[Tian Xia]] nation of [[Xa Hoi]], as it is the racial language of the [[Tian-Dan]] people. It has a throaty character and defaults to an imperative tone.


## Druidic

> This language has been guarded so vigilantly by the [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of Golarion that it remains a secret language to this day.  Speakers of [[Elven]] or [[Sylvan]] may be able to discern a few individual words here and there, but even they remain baffled without a greater context to place them in.


## Dwarven

*For another meaning of "**Dwarven**", please see [[Dwarf]].*
> Dwarven is a clipped language of hard consonants and guttural pronunciation. Dwarven shares its runic alphabet with [[Terran]], along with a number of other similarities. Dwarven names are full of harsh-sounding consonants, and rarely include soft, or sibilant sounds. Honorifics are common in given names, such as "-sun" ("-son"), "-dam" ("-daughter"), and "-hild" ("-wife"). Family names sometimes contain words in [[Common]] such as "gold" or "hammer". Also, the letters Q and X do not appear in Dwarven. *Dörak* is a dwarven term meaning "off-plan", which is not a good thing for dwarves to do.


## Elven

***Main article: [[Elven]]***
> Elven is believed to be among the eldest, if not the eldest of the languages mortals speak on Golarion.  Scholars conjecture that it was formed when [[Elf|elven]] speakers of [[Sylvan]] tried to introduce grammatical rules and vocabulary from both [[Languages of the Great BeyondCelestial|Celestial]] and [[Draconic]]. The elven alphabet contains thirty-three letters (twenty-four consonants and nine vowels). It is a complex language, but sounds poetic in tone and cadence. In [[Tian Xia]], Elven is naturally most commonly spoken in the elven nation of [[Jinin]], although it is also common in [[Kaoling]], [[Zi Ha]], [[Shokuro]], and [[Amanandar]].


## Garuda

> Garuda is the name of the language and the name of the creature that speaks it. [[Garuda|Garudas]] are brightly coloured avian creatures living in tropical climates, including on the island nation of [[Jalmeray]]. Garudas, being intelligent creatures, may also speak [[Common]] and [[Human languages of Golarion|Vudrani]].


## Giant

> The language of the various races of [[Giant|giants]]—sometimes called **Jotun**, or more simply, **Giant**—that exists today is a mixture of [[Cyclops]] and [[Dead languages of GolarionThassilonian|Thassilonian]]. First used by the giant slaves of the [[Runelords|runelords]] in the time before [[Earthfall]], it spread to the rest of Golarion after the destruction of that realm. In [[Tian Xia]], Giant is most commonly spoken in the brutish nation of [[Chu Ye]].


## Girtablilu

> Girtablilu is the language spoken by the [[Girtablilu|humanoid-scorpion hybrid creatures]] of the same name.


## Gnoll

> This language is hard for [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|non-gnolls]] to understand and speak, as it is made up of countless barks, growls and yips. Like many other racial languages, its construction is a clear reflection of the cultural priorities of its speakers: gnoll has 37 words for the term "slave" and only two for "work".


## Gnome

> In terms of the sheer number of words in its vocabulary, Gnome, or **Gnomish**, is the largest language known. It has changed dramatically since [[Gnome|gnomes]] first introduced it to Golarion, a process which has by no means halted. It shares certain similarities with both [[Darklands languagesAklo|Aklo]] and [[Sylvan]].


## Goblin

> Goblin vocabulary is shared by the [[Goblin|goblin]], [[Bugbear|bugbear]], and [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]] races, even if the pronunciations, inflections, and usage differs wildly among them. When spoken by goblins, it is nearly incomprehensible to outsiders, and sounds more like high-pitched yapping. Among the martial hobgoblins, it takes the form of short, barked commands, while the bugbears speak their taunts with a sibilance not heard among the other goblinoid races. It is an extremely flexible language, containing a plethora of terms related to subservience, fear, and death. In [[Tian Xia]], Goblin is the official language of the hobgoblin nation of [[Kaoling]], although the dialect is different from the Goblin spoken in the [[Inner Sea region]]. Goblin speakers there also use the [[Human languages of GolarionTien|Tien]] alphabet.


## Grippli

> [[Grippli|Gripplis]] are humanoids that are clearly related to [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Frog|frogs]]. They may speak [[Common]] but, amongst their own kind, they speak their own language called Grippli. Grippli language is spoken widely in the [[Valashmai Jungle]] as there is a large community of grippli living there.


## Halfling

> The language of [[Halfling|halflings]] is believed to have developed from a coded version of [[Human languages of GolarionTaldane|Taldane]] and Varisian.  It was first used in [[Cheliax]] among the halfling slave population and eventually spread across [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]]. The language has many regional dialects to the point that halflings may find difficulty communicating with foreign halflings in complex areas. Modern halfling has the same grammar structure as [[Azlanti]]; scholars can only suggest why this is the case, but it tends to suggest halflings were present within the ancient Azlanti empire alongside the humans.


## Jotun

*See Giant above*

## Kasatha

> [[Kasatha|Kasathas]] are four-armed humanoids who have their own language, also called Kasatha.


## Kech

> [[Kech|Keches]] are evil simian creatures found in warm jungles who have their own language, also called Kech.


## Kuru

> Kuru is the racial language of the [[Cannibal|cannibalistic]] [[Kuru|kuru]] who make their home in the [[Shackles]].


## Munavri

> Munavri is the racial language of the albino [[Munavri|munavri]] who make their home deep beneath the continent of [[Arcadia]].


## Nagaji

> The hissing Nagaji language is spoken almost exclusively by the inhabitants of [[Nagajor]], specifically the [[Nagaji]]. The Nagaji tongue has been heavily influenced by the [[Naga]] over the centuries, and even when translated possesses various terms considered strange by non-native speakers.


## Orc

> Much like the folk who speak it, **Orc**, or **Orcish**, is a harsh and violent language, full of sharp delivery and hard consonants. It uses the [[Dwarven]] alphabet, and is spoken as a majority language only in the [[Hold of Belkzen]].


## Plantspeech

> Many sentient [[Plant|plants]] manage to communicate with other plants through a 'language' that is equivalent to a continuous *speak with plants* spell, called plantspeech. Sometimes, this plantspeech is only effective for communication with plants of the same species.


## Rougarou

> Rougarous are a shapechanging wolf-headed humanoid, though emphatically not a type of lycanthrope. Usually able to speak Common to those outside their community, rougarous use their own racial language, also called Rougarou, to communicate amongst themselves.


## Sahuagin

> The language of the [[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] sometimes spoken by [[Merfolk|merfolk]] and [[Gillman|gillmen]].


## Samsaran

> Even though the Samsaran language is primarily spoken in the mountainous [[Tian Xia]] nation of [[Zi Ha]], it is also the racial tongue of the [[Samsaran|samsaran]] people, and a secondary language of the [[Kitsune|kitsune]], [[Nagaji|nagaji]], and [[Wayang|wayang]] peoples.


## Sasquatch

> Sasquatch is the name of the language spoken by the simian species of humanoid called sasquatch or, sometimes, "bigfoot". As well as more normal vocal words, the language is supplemented by howls and "knocking" sounds. The latter are produced when a sasquatch bangs a tree or rock with an implement. This complex language sounds similar to the normal sounds in a forest and thus aids in protecting the privacy of the species.


## Senzar

> Senzar is the truly ancient language of the [[Spirit|spirits]] of [[Tian Xia]], and spoken most frequently by the [[Kami|kami]] of the [[Forest of Spirits]] as well as the inhabitants of the [[Wall of Heaven Mountains]]. Scholars believe that it may be the root language of all human tongues on the continent, as many words associated with the spirit world or [[Dragon|dragons]] have Senzar roots. Senzar is also spoken natively by the [[Kitsune|kitsune]], and as a secondary language by the [[Nagaji|nagaji]], [[Samsaran|samsarans]], and [[Wayang|wayang]]. Although the [[Sylvan]] language is known in Tian Xia, most creatures that one would expect to speak it, instead speak Senzar.


## Sphinx

> Sphinx is spoken by the [[Sphinx|guardians]] of [[Osirion]]. The ability to speak this language is needed to become a [[Living monolith|living monolith]].


## Strix

> The language of the [[Strix|winged men of Cheliax]] is a pidgin of [[Dead languages of GolarionAzlanti Ancient Azlanti|Azlanti]] and [[Languages of the Great BeyondInfernal|Infernal]]. The language sounds to human ears more like an [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Eagle|eagle]] screeching than a form of humanoid communication. The strix refer to their own race as *itarii* in their own language.


## Sylvan

> The language of the [[Fey|fey]], Sylvan is one of the most linguistically static of all languages.  Thought to be nearly as old as Draconic or [[Languages of the Great BeyondAbyssal|Abyssal]], Sylvan has a tiny vocabulary, which has barely changed over the eons. Although Sylvan is spoken by a small minority on the continent of [[Tian Xia]], most creatures whom one would expect to speak Sylvan there instead speak [[Senzar]].


## Syrinx

> [[Syrinx|Syrinxes]] are an owl-like [[Humanoid|humanoid]] resident on the continent of [[Arcadia]] that have their own language also called Syrinx.


## Tengu

> The language of the [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]], which may be found in a number of dialects. The language is also spoken by [[Yamabushi tengu|Yamabushi tengus]]: [[Oni|oni]] that resemble tengus, and is the national language of the tengu nation on [[Kwanlai]] in [[Tian Xia]].


## Thriae

> Thriae is the language spoken by the female bee creatures of the [[Thriae|same name]].


## Vanaran

> Vanaran is the racial language of the forest-dwelling, simian humanoids known as [[Vanara|vanara]].


## Vishkanya

> The same word, Vishkanya, is used for the name and the racial language of the [[Vishkanya|dark-skinned humanoids]], who are famous for their ability with [[Poisons of Golarion|poison]].


## Wayang

> The [[Wayang|wayangs]] racial language is spoken in [[Tian Xia]] most commonly in the [[Wandering Isles]].
