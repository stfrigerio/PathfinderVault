 [[Blightburn]], a naturally occurring source of radiation in the [[Darklands]].
> **Radiation** in [[Golarion]] refers to [[Poisons of Golarion|poisonous]] emissions of natural, [[Magic|magical]], or alien energies, and is most frequently encountered in the [[Technology|technological]] ruins of [[Numeria]] and parts of the [[Darklands]]. It can penetrate most materials and its effects can have variable intensity, though its strength-draining effects are slower than most poisons.



## Sources

> Radiation can occur naturally, especially in the Darklands:

> - [[Caphorite]], also called drowstone, is the most common source of radiation in the Darklands. Its emissions include a faint aura of [[Transmutation|transmutation]] magic and can [[Mutant|mutate]] some [[Plant|plants]] and fungi.
> - [[Blightburn]] is a potent source of non-magical radiation that emits a visible green glow and disrupts [[Teleportation|teleportation]] magic.
> - [[Lazurite]] is a source of [[Necromancy|necromantic]] radiation associated with veins of marrowstone in [[Sekamina]].
> Numerous technological items can also generate hazardous levels of radiation:

> - The aptly named [[Extinction wave device|extinction wave device]] is a radioactive [[Bomb|bomb]] that emits radiation so intense that it can kill intelligent creatures across a wide radius without damaging objects or harming mindless creatures.
> - An atom gun emits a targeted beam of radiation.
> - An [[Grenade|atom grenade]] irradiates an area for 24 hours.
> - A fission reactor converts radioactive fuel into nuclear energy.
> Certain [[Arcane|arcane]] spells, such as *irradiate*, also generate radiation through magical means. [[Cleric|Clerics]] of [[God|deities]] whose reach includes radiation can also irradiate objects with nauseating transmutative radiation.


## Detection

> Radioactive energies can be detected by technological devices as well as through [[Spell|spells]], such as *radiation ward*.


## Protection

> Certain types of metals, such as [[Lead|lead]] and [[Djezet 1|djezet]], can block certain types of radioactive energy more effectively than other materials, while the spell *radiation ward* also provides some protection from its effects. Spells that cure the effects of poisons also cure the effects of radiation exposure in creatures, as does the spell *remove radioactivity*, which can also remove radiation lingering in the environment and in more powerful versions drain naturally radioactive materials.
> A powered hazardous environment suit or panic suit can also protect its wearer from the effects of radiation, as can a spacesuit.


## In religion

> Certain deities, especially those worshiped by underground dwellers, include radiation as a [[Subdomain|subdomain]] of their divine oversight. [[Kobold|Kobolds]] suffering from blightburn sometimes worship [[Trelmarixian]], the Horseman of Famine.
