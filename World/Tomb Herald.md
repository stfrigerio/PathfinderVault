> **Tomb Herald** is a unique sort of Bramble that grows in most of [[Avistan|Avistans]] temperate forests and can only be found growing nears burial grounds of some description, it also has a unique property. It is unique in the effect it has on [[Bugbear|bugbears]], when eaten (an unpleasant experience to say the least) it enhances their sense of smell somewhat, when the brambles are fermented into a spirit known as [[Bramble-Sick Brandy]] the effect is increased many time over giving them a far more acute sense of smell and thus making them more ferocious hunters.
