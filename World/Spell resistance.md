> **Spell resistance** is a form of [[Magic|magical]] defense possessed by many creatures, particularly powerful [[Undead|undead]], [[Dragon|dragons]], [[Golem|golems]], and [[Outsider|outsiders]]. It acts as a form of magical immunity, but only against certain types of [[Spell|spells]], and generally only when a creature with spell resistance is specifically targeted by the spell. Creatures can voluntarily lower their spell resistance to allow others to cast beneficial spells on them. Spell resistance does not grant unfettered immunity to these spells, however; the caster can pit his or her own magical might against the spell resistance in order to overcome it and render it useless.
