> The **House of Golden Veils** has served two different [[Deity|deities]] as a temple; since the [[Thrune Ascendancy]], it has served as the house of worship for [[Abadar]]. Situated in the north-eastern corner of the [[Temple Hill Kintargo|Temple Hill]] district of [[Kintargo]], before the draconian rule of [[House Thrune]], the House of Golden Veils was known as the **House of Satin Veils** and served as the temple dedicated to the now outlawed deity [[Calistria]]. Now, the temple primarily serves as a bank as Abadar has attracted few worshipers in the rebellious city; those with a more [[Lawful|lawful]] nature tend to be drawn to the much more powerful [[Temple of Asmodeus Kintargo|church of]] [[Asmodeus]]. As such, the House of Golden Veils' head priest, Mhelrem Gesteliel, focuses more on the mercantile aspect of his god, providing banking services, and also keeping a large stock of [[Divine|divine]] [[Magic item|magic items]], including a powerful *[[Scroll|scroll of]] [[Raise dead|raise dead]]*.
