> A **meteoroid** is a small part of an [[Asteroid|asteroid]], [[Comet|comet]], or other space-borne debris ranging in size from a grain of sand to a few feet in diameter. As it travels through [[Golarion|Golarions]] atmosphere it becomes very hot and bright, leaving a streak across the sky that is known as a **meteor**, but more commonly called as a **shooting star** or **falling star**. If it survives passage through the atmosphere and impacts the ground, it is called a **meteorite**.


## Impacts on Golarion

 While even small meteorite strikes can be destructive, larger impacts can be cataclysmic.
> The biggest meteorite ever to impact Golarion was the [[Starstone]], which was pulled from the heavens by the ancient [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]] to punish the [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] people. Its impact caused global destruction, created the [[Inner Sea]], and plunged the world into the thousand year-long [[Age of Darkness]]. A more recent (and far less destructive) meteorite impact occurred in [[4708 AR]] on the island of [[Devil's Elbow|Devils Elbow]], located in the [[Varisian Gulf]] off the coast of [[Riddleport]]. Much to the surprise of locals, it contained significant deposits of the [[Skymetal|skymetal]] [[Noqual|noqual]].
