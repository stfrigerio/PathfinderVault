> A heatstone is a round or oval piece of volcanic glass that weigh anywhere from 2 to 4 pounds each. They are activated by hitting the stone against a hard surface. Depending on the outside temperature, a heatstone can heat anywhere from a twenty to forty foot square area for up to 24 hours. These stones last three years before they lose their warmth, and must be replaced. This fact keeps their value up in the colder regions of the world. These magical stones are formed naturally in [[Qadira]], where those who wander the desert collect them to sell in [[Katheer]].
> Although they are used to keep troops warm in winter battles, a heatstone cannot offer enough heat to be used as a weapon, or even to cook food with. Some say that [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]] [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]] use heatstones as a device to allow them to listen in on conversations over long distances.
