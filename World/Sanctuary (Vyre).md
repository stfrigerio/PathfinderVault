> **Sanctuary** is one of the three neighbourhoods that make up the district of [[Bliss]] in the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] city of [[Vyre]]. The districts of Bliss are what most people are thinking of when they imagine the sin-soaked City of Masks. Sanctuary is home to a row of derelict temples called [[Heretic's Row|Heretics Row]]; these temples now serve as some of the most prestigious locations in the entire city to set up any sort of den of vice.
