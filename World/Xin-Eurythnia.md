> The ancient city of **Xin-Eurythnia** was the capital of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] realm of Lust, [[Eurythnia]]. Ruled by the [[Runelords|Runelord]] [[Sorshen]], it was destroyed during the cataclysmic events that followed [[Earthfall]] in [[-5293 AR]]. The modern [[Varisia|Varisian]] city-state of [[Korvosa]] is built in the exact same location, and a few ancient remnants of the capital still survive.
