> The **Watcher's Tor** is a rocky schist at a bend of the [[Path River]], where the great [[Castle Overwatch]] was founded. The whole city of [[Vigil]] is planned and built in concentric circles around the Watcher's Tor. Hedgerows of dawn roses, ivory-white and salmon-pink petals edged in scarlet clinging cover its lower slopes, and wild climbing roses scaling even its steeper scarps below the castle. The magnificent [[Cathedral of Sancta Iomedaea]] lies at the foot of Watcher's Tor.
