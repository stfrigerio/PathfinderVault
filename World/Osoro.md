> **Osoro** is one of the [[Planet|planet]] [[Liavara|Liavaras]] five major [[Moon|moons]].


## Geography

> Osoro's lower atmosphere is [[Poisons of Golarion|toxic]], due to the [[Poison|poisonous]] gas produced by [[Sulfur|sulfurous]] vents and poisonous [[Plant|plants]]. Above this layer, which might be anywhere from a few dozen feet to half a mile thick, is the oxygen-rich upper atmosphere.


## Inhabitants

> The intelligent residents of Osoro are colonists from [[Arkanen]] who build their settlements in the oxygen-rich air of the upper atmosphere, and travel between their settlements by long bridges, attached to hang gliders, or by riding [[Magical beast|magical beasts]]. They occasionally have to defend themselves against the dangerous creatures of the poisonous jungles below, and risk being cut off from their kin by wind storms. Recently, various scholars and [[Adventurer|adventurers]] have explored the toxic lower atmosphere with [[Magic|magical]] and [[Technology|technological]] diving apparatuses, seeking to confirm the theory that the poisonous gas layer used to be much thinner and that hidden ruins on the surface might hold secrets about the growth of the gas layer, and its possible recession.
