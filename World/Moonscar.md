*See also: [[The Moonscar]]*
> The **Moonscar** is an alien jungle on the light side of the [[Moon Golarion|Golarions moon]] inhabited by a family of [[Succubus|half-succubi]] sisters who have lived there for the last 12,000 years. They are all descended from a single [[Succubus|succubus]] ancestor, and are generally content to rule their city and occasionally raid or demand tribute from the other pocket ecologies of the moon. These ageless creatures sometimes travel to [[Golarion]] via [[Magic|magical]] flight (a trip that takes 2 years) to abduct [[Humanoid|humanoids]] and return with them to the Moonscar. Many stay on the moon for breeding stock or are sent back to Golarion to become agents of the [[Abyss]].
