*For another meaning of "Void", please see [[Negative Energy Plane]].*
> The **void** is a concept not fully understood, but may be invoked by certain trained [[Wizard|wizards]] who access it similarly to how an elemental wizard might access the four natural elements: air, earth, fire and water. Whether the void is a fifth element is debated, but many agree that it an energy that holds the [[Material Plane]] and all the other planes together, while also binding spirits to sentient creatures.
