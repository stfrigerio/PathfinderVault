> **Himcho** is one of the sacred mountains that dot the [[Wall of Heaven|Wall of Heaven Mountains]] that form the westernmost border of the continent of [[Tian Xia]]. It is the tallest peak in the entire mountain range, standing over 37,000 feet tall, its airless top shrouded in perpetual winter. A range of temples to various [[Deity|gods]] stands at the base of Himcho, but few of the pilgrims that make the arduous trek here ever try and ascend the mountain itself. Translated, Himcho means "Mother of the World".
