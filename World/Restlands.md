> The area used for burying the dead of the town of [[Ravengro]] is called **The Restlands**. It is located on moorland to the north of the small town and well tended by the Church of [[Pharasma]] based in the town's [[Temple of Pharasma Ravengro|temple]] and supervised by Father [[Vauran Grimburrow]]. A local tradition is the respectful drawing of a spiral over one's heart when passing by, or through, the graveyard; this is a reference to the [[Holy symbol|comet symbol]] of the [[Deity|goddess]] Pharasma.
> The large graveyard is 120 yards wide and 80 yards deep and has gravel walkways marked to avoid people walking haphazardly across the graves. The paths are called:

> - Ancestor's Walk
> - The Black Path
> - The Dreamwake
> - The Eversleep
