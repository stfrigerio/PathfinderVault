> The **Holding House** was [[Kintargo|Kintargos]] original prison; the amount it is used has fluctuated over the years. Located in the [[Old Kintargo]] district, the Holding House fell out of use when [[Castle Kintargo]] and [[Kintargo Keep]] began to be used to hold the city's prisoners. For years, the bunker-like structure sat all but abandoned but, with the coming of [[Barzillai Thrune]], it has seen renewed use as a temporary jail and processing centre for those caught in the Lord-Mayor's crackdowns. It is run by an efficient [[Inquisitor|inquisitor]] of the church of [[Asmodeus]] known as [[Sabo|Sabo the Spider]].
