> **Mammon's Bier** is the nexus of [[Erebus]] and the tomb of the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Mammon]]. From here, [[Asmodeus]] expanded vaults beneath the city of [[Dis]] into an entire layer of [[Hell]]. Surrounding a coffin made of [[Diamond|diamond]] are the 13,001 chests of [[Gemstone|gems]], now infused with the energy of the [[Maelstrom]], that Mammon had tried to win the [[Protean|proteans]] over with. Within the coffin is what remains of his former body and seven [[Ruby|rubies]] said to be a drop of blood from each of the original archdevils. The Lord of the Third promotes a common misconception and perceived weakness regarding his crypt. It is commonly believed that Mammon's heart is his former [[Angel|angelic]] body, kept safely guarded in the deepest reaches of his realm. In truth, Mammon's corpse holds no power and is nothing more than dust and bones.
