> **Olakapuna** is an island in the [[Rendah Pulu]] region of [[Minata]], just off the coast of the [[Valashmai Jungle]]. Olakapuna is infamous amongst the wandering islands as, in addition to the [[Demon|demon]]-worshipping [[Cannibals|cannibals]] that inhabit most of Rendah Pulu, Olakapuna is also home to cloisters of [[Evil|evil]] priests and vile [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]] who practise unspeakable blasphemies in the island's depths. Rumour has it that the island, like many of the isles of Rendah Pulu, may contain ruins of the ancient [[Taumata]].
