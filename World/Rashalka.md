 [[Erdija]], a Rashalka centauress of the Voaldyn clan.
> The **Rashalka**, translated as "Thundering Hooves", are an ethnicity of [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] who dwell in large numbers in western and southern [[Iobaria]]. They range from [[Okor's Basin|Okors Basin]] to the [[Caemorin]].
> The most numerous and common of the three primary Iobarian ethnicities, these centaurs are the most similar to the more well-known centaurs of the [[Inner Sea]]. Indeed, the smaller Nomen centaurs of the eastern [[Stolen Lands]] are an offshoot of this larger group.
> The Rashalka are split into a large number of smaller clans or tribes who share certain territory, such as [[Hoofwood]]. The settlement of [[Vurnirn]] is the shared seat of power for the clans Kraask, Phelor, Tsurvom, and Voaldyn, with the city split into three zones of control.
