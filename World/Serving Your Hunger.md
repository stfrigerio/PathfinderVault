 Urgathoa's unholy symbol
> ***Serving Your Hunger*** is one of the [[Unholy|unholy]] and profane texts of the [[Deity|goddess]] [[Urgathoa]], goddess of [[Undeath|undeath]] and [[Disease|disease]]. It was written by her first knight-commander and [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Antipaladin|antipaladin]], [[Dason]] who was rewarded for its completion with the *[[Defiled Disks of Urgathoa]]*. It contains the goddess' basic tenets of faith, several recipes for extravagant meals (a few copies are rumored to include instructions on how to cook [[Humanoid|humanoids]]), and the most well-known ways of becoming [[Undead|undead]] (dealing primarily with [[Ghoul|ghouls]], [[Wight|wights]], and [[Vampire|vampires]]).
> The text contains riddles intended to jar the mind, shaking it loose from conventional thought such as morality and moderation. It also serves as a primer to prepare one's mind for a more conciliatory approach to the undead.
> Urgathoa has several other unholy texts.
