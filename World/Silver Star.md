> The **Silver Star** was believed by most to be a simple [[Musical instrument|musical instrument]] shop in the foreign quarter of the [[Jarvis End]] district until it burned down during [[Kintargo|Kintargos]] [[Night of Ashes]]. Unknown to most, Silver Star had been serving as a secret temple dedicated to the outlawed [[Deity|goddess]] [[Sarenrae]]. The Silver Star's owner, [[Shensen]], was a renowned star of the [[Kintargo Opera House|Kintargo Opera]] but was also a vocal critic of the [[House Thrune|Thrune Government]] inviting their eventual wrathful retribution. Shensen has not been seen since the fire that burned Silver Star to the ground and nothing is known of the congregation that previously secretly worshipped here.
