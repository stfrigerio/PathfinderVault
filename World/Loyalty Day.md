 Flag of Cheliax
> **Loyalty Day** is a holiday in the nation of [[Cheliax]] commemorating the date on [[Calistril]] 19, [[4640 AR]] when [[House Thrune]] signed the [[Treaty of Egorian]], declaring it the victor in the [[Chelish Civil War]] and ruler of the empire. Because of House Thrune's well-known ties to the infernal, this holiday is also observed by the Church of [[Asmodeus]] who consider it a feast day. The church along with local governments provide a free meal to all citizens to remind them of the benefits House Thrune provides them with.
