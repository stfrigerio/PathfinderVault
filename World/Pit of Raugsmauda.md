The **Pit of Raugsmauda** is located on [[Motaku Isle]] in the [[Shackles]]. It was the former subterranean lair of the infamous [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]] [[Raugsmauda]].
> It was assumed that Raugsmauda was gone forever but, in [[4512 AR]], a group of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] descended into the Pit of Raugsmauda and discovered the sorcerer, now transformed into a vicious [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|lich]]. The adventurers fought Raugsmauda who fled westward and eventually settled on a small uninhabited, cave-riddled volcanic isle that now has the name of [[Raugsmauda's Reach|Raugsmaudas Reach]].
> The upper levels of the Pit have long been plundered over the years but much of the massive dungeons of the Pit's cavernous depths still remain unexplored, holding Raugsmauda's treasures and horrors.
