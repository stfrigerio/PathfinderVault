 No matter the rank of a [[Devil|devil]], knowing its true name could grant great power over it (or a horrible death).


“

The magic of true names rests on the principle that if you know someone's name, you have power over them. After all, to name a thing is to describe that thing—but to accurately describe a thing, you have to understand it, and if you understand it, you can control it.

”

> A **true name** is a kind of hidden [[Magic|magic]] word inscribed upon each [[Soul|soul]], though it is very hard to find a [[Mortal|mortal]]'s true name.

## Learning true names

> Apart from intensive research, there are several ways in which to learn a creature's true name:

> - locate a "namer" in a secret society whose work is to teach others already determined true names;
> - if a true name was recorded by [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] even long-dead before, others can find it;
> - the true names of popular targets can rarely be found in prayers, in a dedicated way or through protective chants;
> - [[Occultist|occultists]] using trances;
> - [[First World]] and similar entities' true names could be found looking in nature;
> - for a lucky few, the true name just comes to them spontaneously;
> - a *true name amulet* reveals the true name of a single creature only to its wearer if they have invested the amulet.

## Variations of true names

> For many creatures, the nature of true names may vary. For example,

> - a [[Devil|devil]]'s true name is mutable as it gains in stature;
> - an [[Elemental|elemental]] suffers no penalties when its true name is used during a [[Binding outsiders|binding]] [[Ritual|ritual]], though it often starts with a more positive attitude towards a binder who knows its true name;
> - [[Protean|proteans]] and [[Qlippoth|qlippoths]] lack true names as they are fundamentally too [[Chaotic|chaotic]];
> - there is a rumor about [[Aeon|aeons]] having two true names and the need for both to take control of such creatures; this makes handling aeons tricky;
> - a particular [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aberration|aberration]] was aware of his true name but tore it off.

## Nameless thing

> When a creature, such as an [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Aberration|aberration]], [[Celestial|celestial]], [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiend]], [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Monitor|monitor]], or [[Spirit|spirit]] enters the [[Material Plane]] from another [[Plane|plane]] or another [[Universe|universe]] altogether—one where the laws of magic are different—they may not have any true name and are designated as **nameless things**.


## Fragmentary names

> Sometimes, a binder only knows fragments of a creature's true name, not the whole one. Still, they could try using the [[Spell|spell]] *compel true name* with the fragmentary name, or another true name ability against the opponent creature, although this is very dangerous as [[Incapacitation|incapacitation]] can stack with this usage.
> A further danger to the caster failing in the use of *compel true name* is that this reveals the caster's true name fragmentarily or fully to its opponent.
