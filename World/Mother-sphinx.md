> The **mother-sphinx** is one of the two mascots of [[Absalom]], the other being the [[Hippocampus|hippocampus]]. The [[Sphinx|sphinx]] is the older of the two, brought over by some of the first inhabitants migrating to Absalom from [[Osirion]]. The mother-sphinx almost always has the body of a [[Lion|lion]], a female [[Humanoid|humanoid]] woman's torso and head, and wings. She often has [[Human|human]]-like hands, carries a scale and scepter, and is sometimes shown as pregnant, holding a [[Scroll|scroll]], or riding on the crest of a wave.
> She represents the mixed nature of the city, using the hybrid form of the sphinx to represent the various locations around [[Golarion]]. She also can be found on the platinum sphinx, Absalom's [[Platinum|platinum]] [[Coin|coin]].
