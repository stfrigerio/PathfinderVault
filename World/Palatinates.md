> **The Palatinates** is the collective term for the three counties of north-eastern [[Ustalav]] which deposed their hereditary ruling families in 4674 AR and replaced them with citizens' councils: **Palatine Councils**. These are [[Canterwall]], [[Lozeri]], and [[Vieland]]. The other counties of Ustalav continue under noble rule, and are known collectively as the [[Soivoda]].  The adjective describing the Palatinates is **Palatine**.


## History

> The first of these counties to overthrow autocratic rule was Lozeri, in [[4670 AR]], in a relatively non-violent coup. The ruler of all Ustalav at that time, [[Valislav Ordranti|Prince Valislav Ordranti]], was disinterested by this political manoeuvre and quickly recognized the new arrangement in Lozeri. Shortly thereafter, the two counties of Vieland and [[Tamrivena]] followed suit, the latter county re-established itself and changed its name to Canterwall. These three counties became known as the Palatinates.


## Current situation

> Nowadays, the Palatinates are known for innovative ideals and [[Science|scientific]] advances. Although some view them as a danger to society due to their methods, academics, [[Alchemist|alchemists]], and other highly educated individuals are making fast progress in the fields of science. Recently, black market imports from [[Numeria]] have allowed significant breakthroughs in [[Clockwork|clockwork]] automation, electricity, steam power, and many other fields.
