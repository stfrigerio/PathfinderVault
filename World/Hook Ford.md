> The [[Pale River]] may not be particularly wide but it is for most of its length deep, with **Hook Ford** one of the few places where it can be forded. Hook Ford is a vital asset to the nearby town of [[Bronze Hook]] which once grew rich of the toll charged to cross the river. As land based trade across the [[Uwaga Highlands]] trade route became less common, Hook Ford became less and less important. Now, the only reminder of its former importance is a watchtower manned by a single guard. The only other notable feature is the pride of [[Dragonne|dragonnes]] that live in the nearby hills that the lone guard keeps placated with offerings of meat.
