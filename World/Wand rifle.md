> Designed by [[Pathfinder]] [[Kaldis Blacksquall]], the **wand rifle** is a wooden-barreled device that can be loaded with two separate [[Magic item|magical]] [[Wand|wands]]. This enables the user to cycle between them as desired, though only a single wand can be activated at a time. The slender barrel provides greater accuracy to the user than when wielding a wand by hand. The rifle itself can be fitted with a serrated bayonet for use in situations when ranged attacks are not possible or ideal.
