> **Grandbridge Vagabond Camp** is sometimes considered the sixteenth district of [[Oppara]]. Most Opparans don't consider it part of the city because of its location on the south shore of the [[River Porthmos]], across the [[Grand Bridge of the Empire]] and its history of viciously attempts to raid or destroy it.
It is a massive camp of more than a thousand [[Vagabond|vagabonds]], wanted criminals, escaped convicts, and runaway soldiers and sailors. It is largely ignored by the Taldan authorities, mainly because whenever they tried to clear it, they met stiff armed resistance.
