> **Narmek Tar Kuata**, a [[Sothis|Sothan]] priest of [[Irori]] now venerated as a saint, founded the the [[Monastery of Tar Kuata]] near [[Tar Kuata]] in [[Osirion]] in [[1490 AR]]. The relics of his skull and spine remain in a spire of rock near the mountain's summit, and thieves' attempts to steal result in disaster.
