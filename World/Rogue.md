> Cunning and quick, the **rogue** brings skill and expertise to aid his teammates and outsmart his enemies. In battle, they hide in the shadows and ambush their foes, just to disappear again after the strike. Each rogue's approach to their craft depends on their racket, and their vast knowledge of numerous topics lets them specialize as they see fit.
> Rogues are the clever tricksters of the world, the consummate professional criminals, or even the highly trained informants and spies. Where [[Fighter|fighters]] rely on their martial training, [[Wizard|wizards]] on their mastery of [[Arcane|arcane]] power, and [[Cleric|clerics]] on the grace of their [[Deity|deity]], the rogue relies on training of the body and mind to overcome obstacles. They are any combination of athletic, cunning, shifty, convincing, learned, and crafty. They augment their training with a precise working knowledge of anatomy: where to deliver a knock-out blow when the situation requires.



## On Golarion

> Rogues typically begin their training aloneâ€”learning from various teachers in secret, on the hard streets, or in the wild. The so-called "thieves" guilds of [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]] rarely take such training upon themselves, preferring to recruit able members and avoid the messy physical and financial costs of training new ones. Depending on the location, guilds might operate in secret (the most common method), in the open (such as [[Absalom]] and [[Sedeq]]), or even with some degree of authority. Fortunately, constant wars between rival guilds often limit the resources and effectiveness of these ubiquitous organizations.
> [[Adventurer|Adventuring]] rogues are common, thanks to their unique skills set. Though guilds frown on thieves operating independently, they have no control over other occupations, though adventuring does often attract their attention thanks to the enormous wealth that can be accrued by such activity.
> Rogues are common across the regions and nations of [[Golarion]]. As a matter of course, the class is much more common in areas with loose laws and looser morals. The [[Shackles]], [[Varisia]], and [[Katapesh]] all give rise to abnormally high numbers of rogues. [[Nidal]] and the [[River Kingdoms]] city of [[Daggermark]] are another exception, as they are a haven for [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Assassin|assassins]]. Large guilds can also be found in Absalom, [[Manaket]], [[Korvosa]], [[Oppara]], [[Port Peril]], Sedeq, and [[Westcrown]].


## Races

> Being a rogue is a way of life, and is mostly reliant on self-fulfilled goals. The rogue is as common across the races as it is throughout regions, social strata, nations, or districts.
> There are no restrictions on the race of a rogue, but [[Elf|elf]], [[Goblin|goblin]], [[Halfling|halfling]], [[Catfolk|catfolk]], [[Kobold|kobold]], [[Ratfolk|ratfolk]], [[World/Culture/Races/Tengu|tengu]], [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]], [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], [[Changeling|changeling]], [[Tiefling|tiefling]], [[Beastkin|beastkin]], [[Fetchling|fetchling]], [[Bestiary/Fleshwarp|fleshwarp]], [[Ganzi|ganzi]], [[Kitsune|kitsune]], [[Sprite|sprite]], [[Strix|strix]], [[Anadi|anadi]], [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]], [[Grippli|grippli]], and [[Automaton|automaton]] [[Adventurer|adventurers]] often become rogue.


## Religions

> Rogues are a diverse lot, and might cast their favor to any [[Deity|deity]] they feel helps their personal cause. [[Calistria]] is no doubt one of the most common deity of rogues, emphasizing trickery and revenge. [[Cayden Cailean]] also shares many personality traits with some members of the class. [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good]] rogues might be inclined towards [[Desna]], while those focused on battle might choose [[Gorum]]. [[Evil]] rogues tend towards [[Norgorber]] or [[Droskar]]. [[Abadar]] is common, though often too strict for a rogue's slippery morals.
> [[Achaekek]] deserves a special mention as the patron deity of the [[Red Mantis]], a group of contract assassins operating from [[Mediogalti|Mediogalti]].
