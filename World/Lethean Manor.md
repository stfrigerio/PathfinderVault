> Built upon the [[Laurelight Hill]], **Lethean Manor** has served as the ancestral home of the [[House Caliphvaso]] for generations. Lethean Manor sits amongst manicured private gardens of sweetly scented [[Poison|poisons]], dotted with eerily gazing statues; it overlooks much of the rest of the city of [[Caliphas city|Caliphas]]. The manor is the most regularly used home of [[Carmilla Caliphvaso|Countess Carmilla Caliphvaso]] and her all-male serving staff; it also serves as the most common venue for her much-lauded fetes. Those who attend such revelries at the Lethean Manor recall the decadence of their surroundings, scandalous entertainments, and a feeling of constantly being observed, but little else. Details of what actually occurred at these gatherings, or in the manor itself, are scarce.
