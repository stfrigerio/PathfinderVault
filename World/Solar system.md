*This article covers [[Golarion|Golarions]] solar system. For solar systems in general, see [[httpenwikipediaorgSolar system|Wikipedia]].*
> The **solar system** in which [[Golarion]] exists is vast and yet just a tiny part of the infinite [[Material Plane]]. It contains many other worlds, some of which are inhabited.


## Composition

> The following [[Astronomy|astronomical]] bodies or objects can be found within the solar system:

> - The [[Sun|sun]] is the source of all light and sits at its center.
> - The eleven [[Planet|planets]] that orbit the sun, in order from the closest to the most distant from the sun: [[Aballon]], [[Castrovel]], [[Golarion]], [[Akiton]], [[Verces]], [[Eox]], [[Triaxus]], [[Liavara]], [[Bretheda]], [[Apostae]], and [[Aucturn]].
> - Numerous [[Moon|moons]] around many of these planets.
> - The remnants of two other planets, [[Damiar]] and [[Iovo]], which now form an [[Asteroid|asteroid]] belt called the [[Diaspora]].
> - [[Comet|Comets]].
> - General space debris, which may be witnessed as a falling star or [[Meteorite|meteorite]].

## Travel

> Travel between the planets of the solar system often requires [[Magic|magic]], and most are connected via permanent [[Portal|magical portals]]. These bridges tend to either be lost or heavily guarded, resulting in very little [[Space travel|interplanetary travel]].
