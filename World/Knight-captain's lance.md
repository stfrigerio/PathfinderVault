> A ***knight-captain's lance*** is a [[Mechanics/Spells/Spells/Level 1/Magic Weapon|magic]] lance that changes color and style to match the wielder's [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]], and its pennant displays the wielder's personal [[Heraldry|heraldry]], if any. This lance is particularly effective against creatures harmed by [[Silver|silver]]. A blow from the lance often raises the morale of the wielder's allies.
