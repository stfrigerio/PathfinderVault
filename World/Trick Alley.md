> **Trick Alley** is a [[Cheapside]] neighborhood in the southeast of [[Cheliax|Cheliaxs]] capital, [[Egorian]].  Located between Parley Circle and Bilgetown, it is one of the poorest districts in the city.  It gains its name from the many brothels and houses of ill-repute which can be found there, the most infamous of which is the Tall Tail, a bordello with exclusively [[Tiefling|tiefling]] employees.
