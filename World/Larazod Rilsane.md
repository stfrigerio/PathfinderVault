> **Larazod Rilsane** is the main character in the the notorious [[Cheliax|Chelish]] play *[[The Six Trials of Larazod]]*, written by [[Lokoris Sarini]]. A [[Tiefling|tiefling]] at a time when being a tiefling isn't easy. To most [[Chelaxian|Chelaxians]], tieflings are considered a distasteful mixing of pure bloodlines and diabolic influences based not on thoughtful and potent compacts and bargains, but rather a crude relationship and mere carnal episode bearing rotten fruit. Larazod is a low-ranking scion of a lesser house and has no real influence. He achieved nominal acclaim as an officer in the [[Everwar]] but has never really been recognized as a hero. He is an odd choice for [[Asmodeus|Asmodeuss]] messenger, but his faith in the Dark Lord is peerless and unquestioning. He is a simple and low-ranking member of society who is chosen nonetheless by Asmodeus to right a terrible wrong through faith alone.
