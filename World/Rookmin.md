> According to the records in [[Caliphas]], **Rookmin** was a small trade village in the country of [[Ustalav]]. Its inhabitants worked the salt mines in the nearby hills, and later quarried fine granite there. Salt and granite were sent downriver across [[Lake Encarthan]].The village, as well as its salt mines and its granite quarries, were abandoned, when the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] raised the [[Orc|orc]] hordes in [[3203 AR]]. Five centuries later, the crusaders of the [[Shining Crusade]], established [[Fort Lorrin]] in the area. After the end of the crusade, this site was chosen as the location for [[Vigil]], the new capital of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]].
