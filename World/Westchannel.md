> **Westchannel** is the main waterway of [[Westcrown]]. It splits sharply from the [[River Adivian]] directly after the split of the Dhaenflow. Garbage rarely flowed into Westchannel, and people said that Westchannel is blessed by [[Aroden]]. The truth is that a century after Aroden's passing, more and more wood, ship wrack, and other flotsam drifts into the Westchannel and the island's canals.
