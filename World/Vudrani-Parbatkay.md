> The **Vudrani-Parbatkay** are one of the many ethnicities that make up the greater [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]] people.  
The Vudrani-Parbatkay dwell amongst the highest reaches of the more northern ranges of the [[Johar Mountains|Johar]] and [[Pardaparbat Mountains]] in isolated settlements and holy pagodas. Stockier and lighter in skin colour than the typical Vudrani, the Vudrani-Parbatkay are viewed as being somewhat aloof but also more pragmatic, due to the harshness of life in the high mountains.
