> A ***ring of shadow walking***, which has a dull black stone set into the band, allows its wearer to open a portal into the [[Shadow Plane]]. When it is activated, a swirling black mist arises to form the portal through which the monochromatic Shadow Plane may be viewed and entered by the wearer and her companions. Due to the nature of the Shadow Plane and the [[Material Plane]], travelling between two points on the Material Plane via the Shadow Plane is much faster than simply travelling between them on the Material Plane.
