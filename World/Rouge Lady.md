> '**The Rouge Lady** is a gambling hall in the town of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] in [[Andoran]]. The [[Silk|silk]]-veiled rooms in the back of the building double as a brothel. The Rouge Lady's owner, [[Kabran Bloodeye]], is the leader of the [[Redrock Guild]], a criminal organization that controls the town's underground activities for [[Thuldrin Kreed]]. Kabran's best prostitutes work at the Rouge Lady. His current favorite is [[Ralla Hebbradan]] who is ever in demand by wealthy patrons. The gambling hall offers several games of chance, such as "huckle-chuck", "Rouge Lady-Grim Lady", and "Spin the Saw". The basement of the Rouge Lady serves as a torture chamber where Kabran interrogates anyone that Thuldrin suspects of crossing the [[Lumber Consortium]]. Kabran enjoys flaying his enemies alive beneath the gambling hall and their screams add to the Lady's dark atmosphere.
