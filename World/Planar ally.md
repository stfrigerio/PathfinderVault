> ***Planar ally***, ***lesser planar ally***, and ***greater planar ally*** are a trio of [[Spell|spells]] that allow the caster to [[Calling|call]] a servant of a [[God|deity]] from the [[Great Beyond]] in order to bargain with him or her, generally in order to perform a specific task. Unlike [[Summoning|summoning]] spells, the creature bargained with is not compelled to perform the task, and the caster must therefore negotiate a price for its service. The price depends on the time needed to perform the task, its level of danger, and the overall power of the servant. The three versions of the spell each summons a servant or servants of a god of increasing levels of power from lesser to greater.

 A [[Dretch|dretch]] is a possible choice for a *planar ally* spell, but much more powerful allies are available.
