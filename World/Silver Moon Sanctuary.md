> The **Silver Moon Sanctuary** is the [[Pathfinder Lodge]] of [[Olfden]] in the nation of [[Andoran]]. 
> A fairly new Lodge, the Silver Moon Sanctuary is administered by the semi-retired [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] [[Luna Aldred]] and serves as both a Pathfinder Lodge and an animal sanctuary. It houses the descendants of many of the original wolves that haunted the town during the Night of Silver Blood.


## Description

> Sitting at the outskirts of Olfden, a statue in front of the building depicts a woman welding blade and wand against an overwhelming force of werewolves. The lodge itself is decorated with trophies from Lunaâ€™s adventuring days, as well as gifts from grateful townsfolk.
