> **Swift Prison** is a rarity for [[Taldan]] prisons, in that it is not on the frontier, rather it is within [[Old Cassomir]], and financed by the [[Taldan Imperial Navy|Imperial Navy]].



## Management of the prison

> Under the watchful eyes of the **thief-takers**, who are trained in the **"Rules of the Swift"** and who memorize the faces of every prisoner, few prisoners have ever escaped in the prison's more than ten-century-long history.


## Parts of the prison

> The prison complex is built to a design by [[Engineering|engineers]] from the Ismacco family, including a [[Gold|golden]] statue at the front of the prison.
> Not merely a standard prison, it is also a complete city block with blocks of apartments, a factory, shops, even an open-air market. Lesser criminals, non-capital offenders, under "house arrest" are given leave to walk the entire city block upon which the thousand-plus-year-old prison is housed, (within the confines of the "Rules of the Swift" which form an invisible wall that earns the death penalty for those who cross it).
> Capital offenders, those awaiting the monthly "workman's holiday" and their parade to [[Pharasma's Pulpit|Pharasmas Pulpit]] to meet [[Maximilian Marley]], [[Cassomir|Cassomirs]] Lord High Executioner, are contained in the central prison keep under heavy chains.

## Recent history

> A [[4710 AR]] [[Aspis Consortium]] plot—involving [[Dero|dero]] worshippers of [[Groetus]] abducting all of the prisoners and guards, taking them through the cellar known as Stavian's Fair and the extensive Ismacco tunnel system, to the [[Darklands]]—resulted in the theft of Swift Prison's (and even one of [[Taldor|Taldors]]) greatest treasures: the [[Artifact|artifact]] known as the *bell of obedience*.
