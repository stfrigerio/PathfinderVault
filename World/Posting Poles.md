> Around the town of [[Ravengro]] are five huge wooden posts called **Posting Poles**, which are used to disseminate news to residents. To ensure that all five posts carry the same information, the lad [[Pevrin Elkarid]] is employed as 'Post Boy': he charges 1 [[Copper piece|copper piece]] to make five copies of any message and ensure they are attached to each Posting Pole for a week.
> The five poles are situated as follows:

> - The north side of the [[Town Square Ravengro|town square]];
> - Outside the [[Laughing Demon]] tavern;
> - Just off the eastern end of the northernmost bridge across the Ravengro Creek;
> - Outside the [[Temple of Pharasma Ravengro|Temple of Pharasma]];
> - Outside [[Mirta Straelock]]'s house to the south of the town.
> The Posting Poles may be used for such news items as banns of marriage, job vacancies and requests from locals; what residents favour the most is the weekly *[[Wealday Parchment]]*, a simple newspaper for the town written by [[Gharen Muricar]].
