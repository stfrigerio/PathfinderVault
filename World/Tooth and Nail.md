> The **Tooth and Nail** is a quiet, run-down tavern located on [[Tuce Alley]] in the [[Old Kintargo]] district of [[Kintargo]] and is run by [[Setrona Sabinus]]. The Tooth and Nail is an unassuming single-floor building marked only by a post with four old nails and six [[Wolf|wolves]] teeth hammered into it; it shares its roof with the neighbouring [[Sweet Tooth]] confectionery shop. The interior of the Tooth and Nail is poorly lit, stinking of spilt [[Alcoholic beverages|booze]] and smoke, and filled with dilapidated furniture that was cheap when new decades ago.
