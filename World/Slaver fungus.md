> At first sight, the [[Darklands]] fungus known as **Slaver Fungus**, resembles a spider or other Darklands vermin. This is because the fungus's spores attach to vermin and seep inside to replace the vermin's innards with its own tendrils, killing the creature. The fungus uses the animated dead body to travel around the Darklands looking for its next meal.
