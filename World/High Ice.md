> The **High Ice** is the vast plateau covered by [[Golarion]]'s polar ice cap. It lies between the inhabitable tundra of the [[Outer Rim]] and the cold desert of the [[Boreal Expanse]] at the North Pole. The High Ice is situated on a mile-high massif, and in some places hides entire mountain ranges beneath its frozen bulk. Due to its elevation and distance from the equator, this region is frozen year-round. Nearly 2,000 miles across and a mile thick, the icepack is worn smooth by the wind over most of its expanse, though crevasses can open up unexpectedly due to glacial shifting.
> The High Ice supports little life compared to the Outer Rim, but it is hardly devoid of inhabitants. Small [[Animal|animals]] such as [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fox|foxes]], [[Ermine|ermines]], martens, fishers, lynx, hares, and sable retreat to these highlands during the summer, and [[Mountain goat|mountain goats]] live here year-round. Lichen and tiny [[Bore-worm|bore-worms]] are ubiquitous, which provide food for the amphibian [[Novosi|novosis]] and crustacean [[Khaba|khabas]].
> There are few native [[Humanoid|humanoids]] on the High Ice, and of these, the [[Snowcasters|Snowcaster]] [[Elf|elves]] are the most common, dwelling in the taiga on its edges. [[Frost giant|Frost]] and [[Taiga giant|taiga giants]] from [[Urjuk]] sometimes roam the tundra. Some hunters, hermits, and merchants can be found wandering the waste, but [[Human|humans]] by and large shun this region. The [[Path of Aganhei]] winds across the High Ice, leading back down onto the Outer Rim at the [[Koumssa Gap]] and [[Ovorikheer Pass]].
