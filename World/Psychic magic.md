> **Psychic magic**, also called **psionics** or **mindcraft**, is one of three types of [[Magic|magic]] (along with [[Arcane|arcane]] and [[Divine magic|divine magic]]) that can manifest in the form of [[Spell|spells]] and spell-like effects. It is unique for its focus on the spellcaster's internal powers—drawing magic through emotion and will rather than through study, birthright, or divine grant—and has strong ties to [[Occult|occult]] studies.
