> The **Grand Lodge** is the world headquarters for the organization of explorers known as the [[Pathfinder Society]]. Located in the [[Foreign Quarter]] of the city of [[Absalom]], it is a massive fortress surrounded by tall stone walls. Within the outer walls sit seven smaller fortified structures that each have a separate function, the largest of which is [[Skyreach]], an enormous five-towered building, which also houses the Society's Grand Hall.


## History

> The Grand Lodge was officially founded in [[4320 AR]] and becomes the organization's home base. The central building is a manor house on land that was donated to the Society by [[Selmius Foster]] in [[4319 AR]], which had been granted to Foster by the city as thanks for the opening of the [[Vudra|Vudran]] [[Spice|spice]] trade to the merchant fleets of Absalom.


## Entry

> Those who wish to join the Society must present themselves at the gates of the Grand Lodge, which bears the [[Glyph of the Open Road]]. If accepted, the initiate lives and trains at the Grand Lodge. If an initiate is promoted to full [[Pathfinder]] status, the Confirmation ceremony also takes place here.


## Staff

> [[Venture-Captain]] [[Ambrus Valsin]] runs the daily operations of the Grand Lodge at the [[Decemvirate]]'s command.


## Celebrations

> Every [[Pathfinder]] is invited to return to the Grand Lodge yearly for a celebration known as the [[Grand Convocation]]. This is generally a boisterous occasion where participants share their past discoveries and journeys and engage in friendly competition.


## Physical description

> The Grand Lodge has been the seat of the Pathfinder Society for more than 400 years. Carved out of white stone, it is a five-towered fortress that can be seen throughout the city as a shining beacon of the Pathfinder spirit. Notable sights in the Grand Lodge include:


### The Repository

> The Grand Lodge is home to a vast collection of [[Artifact|artifacts]], books, and [[Scroll|scrolls]] known as the Repository. The location of the entrance to the Repository is a closely guarded secret known only to the [[Decemvirate]]. Inside the Repository, 66 tongue-less criminals acquired from Absalom's criminal justice system toil under the [[Magic|magical]] motivation of *geas*, transcribing and illustrating reports from Pathfinders throughout the world for entry into new editions of the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]*. The Repository is rumored to contain the only complete set of the *Pathfinder Chronicles* in existence.


### The Vaults

It serves as a memorial for all Pathfinders who have died in service to the Society since the wall's creation in [[4330 AR]], and its surface is etched with the name and date of death for each Pathfinder.

### Center House
