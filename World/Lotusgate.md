> **Lotusgate** is one of the many active [[Elf gate|elf gates]] in [[Kyonin]]'s capital city, [[Iadara]], and part of [[Alseta's Ring|Alsetas Ring]]. It was the first *[[Elf gate|aiudara]]* created by [[Candlaron]] and once linked Alseta's Ring to [[Kyonin]]. The Kyonin side of Lotusgate is now the hub of another *aiudara* network, its connection to Alseta's Ring forgotten.
> The gate is a delicate stone arch, and its name is derived from its location at the heart of a series of ring-shaped gardens filled with lotus flowers. It leads to the hub known as [[Galtgate]].
