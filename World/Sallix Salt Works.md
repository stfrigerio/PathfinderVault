> The **Sallix Salt Works** are the largest and oldest such business in all [[Kintargo]] and are located in the oldest part of the city, [[Old Kintargo]]. Much of the [[Salt|salt]] works is taken up by the huge salt pit where the salt is dried, and the furnace that heats the pit; the rest is taken up by salt storage and the work area. Shortly after the rise of [[Barzillai Thrune|Lord-Mayor Barzillai Thrune]] and the [[KintargoHistory|Night of Ashes]], the Sallix Salt Works were taken over by the [[House Thrune|Thrune government]] to be used for prisoner internment and to generate additional revenue. It is now run by the sadistic [[Dwarf|dwarven]] mercenary [[Kossrani]].
