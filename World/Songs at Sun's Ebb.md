> ***Songs at Sun's Ebb*** is a collection of poems by the alchemist [[Vumeshki]].
> Perhaps the most notable poem is *Ilvarandin*, a four stanza piece which describes a physical utopia deep beneath the earth which grants eternal life to its inhabitants. Some later versions include a fifth stanza, clearly written by a later (and inferior) poet, which gives a darker and more sinister picture of Ilvarandin.
> In fact, *Ilvarandin* was written by Vumeshki whilst under the influence of [[Midnight milk|midnight milk]], a strange drug which transports the user's consciousness to the ruined city of [[Ilvarandin]], home of the drug's [[Intellect devourer|intellect devourer]] creators.
