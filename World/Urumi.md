> A coil of steel appearing to be similar to a coiled [[Whip|whip]], the **urumi** (pronounced er-OO-mee) is a slashing [[Weapon|weapon]] capable of carving up flesh as well as any [[Sword|sword]]. The coil is built for durability and flexibility, allowing it to hold a sharp edge, while still able to manipulate its shape as needed. An urumi can be used to attack opponents next to the wielder, or up to 10 feet away.


## Nalinivati

> Nalinivati, the patron [[Naga|naga]] [[Deity|goddess]] of the [[Nagaji|nagaji]], chooses the urumi as one of her favoured [[Weapon|weapons]]. This favoured status of the weapon by Nalinivati's followers led to a wider popularity for the urumi across the [[Inner Sea region]].
