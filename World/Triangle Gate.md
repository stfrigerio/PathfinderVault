> **Triangle Gate** is the southernmost of the sixteen city districts of [[Sothis]], thus located in 'upper' Sothis. To its north-east is the similarly rich district of [[Newstone]], whereas to its north-west lies the seedy district of [[Crimson Island]]. Like the other rich, peripheral suburbs, Triangle Gate contains large oasis circles; wide, tree-lined streets; and excellent facilities for its inhabitants. These residents include wealthy merchants and craftsmen, civil servants and even nobles dwelling in their mansions.
