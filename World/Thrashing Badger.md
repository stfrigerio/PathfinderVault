**The Thrashing Badger** was a rough-and-ready bar in the [[Yolubilis Harbor]] district of [[Kintargo]] that burned to the ground during the [[KintargoHistory|Night of Ashes]]. Before its destruction, The Thrashing Badger was home not just to rowdy sailors and labourers but also served as a drinking hole for a myriad of malcontents and rebels, most of whom now drink at nearby [[Clenchjaw's|Clenchjaws]] instead.
