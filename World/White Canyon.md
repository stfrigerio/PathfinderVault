> **White Canyon** is not a single passage but a network of branching gulfs whose walls narrow overhead. [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|Gnolls]] live in hide tents in the most sheltered areas, or dig burrows at the base of the canyon walls. [[Rath Sandstalker]] conducts frequent raids on caravans and small settlements, seeking healthy [[Humanoid|humanoids]] to sell at the [[Fleshfairs]]. The warriors of [[Fort Longjaw]] attempt an attack from time to time.
> The White Canyon tribe is the second-largest [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]] hold in [[Katapesh]].
> Despite the lingering fear many people have of the monstrous population here, the gnolls have not been a unified threat since the [[Siege of Solku]], when the tribe assailed the city of [[Solku]]. Even so, persistent rumours speak of of [[Noor]], the Red Sultana, who is said to be attempting to gather the gnolls under her banner for another assault on the city, and then beyond.
