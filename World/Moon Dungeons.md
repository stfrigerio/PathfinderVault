> The **Moon Dungeons** are the name given to the mysterious tunnels that burrow beneath [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Moon Golarion|moon]]. This system of caves and tunnels should not be present, as the moon has no liquid water or geological activity, yet they still exist. They have been explored by the inhabitants by the [[City of the Faceless]] for thousands of years. In fact, exploration of the Moon Dungeons was one of the chief reasons the [[Azlanti]] established the penal colony there in the first place. Recently, it has been rumored that the inhabitants of that city have found something in the tunnels that could be of vast importance.
