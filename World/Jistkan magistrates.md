> During the middle-period of the [[Jistka Imperium]], the **magistrates** were one of the two factions struggling for power. Magistrates made pacts with [[Outsider|outsiders]], mainly with [[Genie|genies]], to guard the Imperium's borders. They relied on their extraplanar allegiances and established their most prominent holdings in northern [[Garund]] where the genies were prevalent, often putting powerful [[Efreet|efreet]] and [[Shaitan|shaitans]] at the command of their impressive armies of Jistkan legionnaires.
