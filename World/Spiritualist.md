> A **spiritualist** has an intimate link to one powerful [[Phantom|phantom]], an emotionally unstable spirit who escaped a descent to the [[Negative Energy Plane]] to seek refuge in the [[Material Plane]]. They are rare and seemingly gain their powers at random rather than through study and practice. In superstitious places, a spiritualists's phantom is often mistaken for an [[Evil|evil]] [[Undead|undead]] entity. They are also commonly confused for [[Summoner|summoners]] and [[Eidolon|eidolons]].

## Regions

> [[Pharasma|Pharasmins]] are suspicious of a spiritualist's control over a [[Soul|soul]], with some going so far as to accuse them of being **spirit-slavers**. Others, particularly in [[Absalom]], view spiritualists warily and are often skeptical of their powers or fearful of their tampering with souls. [[Nex|Nexians]] see spiritualists as potential infiltrators from [[Geb's Rest]], while phantoms are pitied in [[Osirion]] and [[Thuvia]].
> However, [[Ustalav|Ustalavs]] welcome spiritualists for their ability to speak to and silence restless spirits, and [[Varisian|Varisians]], [[Shoanti]], and people in the [[Shackles]] are more common and respected.
