> Scion Lady **Xerashir of House Shamyyid**, Bey of [[Sarenrae]], leads the [[Temple of the Shining Star]] in [[Absalom]]. Every morning, she rises to greet the dawn at the Mark, the world's largest sundial, a practice long ago commanded by the Dawnflower. She is deeply involved in secular affairs, especially the politics of the [[Ascendant Court]] and the city as a whole.
