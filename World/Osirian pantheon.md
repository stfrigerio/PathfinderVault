 From left, the Osirian gods [[Khepri]], [[Sobek]], and [[Hathor]].
> Since the [[Age of Destiny]], the people of [[Osirion]] have worshiped their own local gods in addition to those deities venerated more commonly throughout the [[Inner Sea region]]. Their worship was most popular during the early millennia and waned as the Osirian people gradually turned to  foreign deities. During the [[Age of Enthronement]], the Osirian gods, while continuing to guide Osirion from afar, retreated from [[Golarion]] and turned their attention towards the distant land of [[Egypt|Kemet]]. When Osirion was under [[Kelesh|Keleshite]] rule, the foreign overlords sought to eradicate the faith of the indigenous gods, but they remain a part of the history of Osirion's land and people. Since the restoration of native Osirian rule in [[4609 AR]], interest in these ancient divinities has been rekindled.
