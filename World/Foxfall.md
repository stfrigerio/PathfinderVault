> The **Foxfall** is a large woodland forming what is most of the south-west of the county of [[Odranto]] in [[Ustalav]]. The mighty [[Vhatsuntide River]] flows past its entire western border and the northern border is provided by the river [[Brookwall]]. Within the forest may be found the haunted hotel called [[House Beumhal]] and [[Castle Odranto]].
