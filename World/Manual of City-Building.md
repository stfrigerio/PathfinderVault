 Abadar's Holy Symbol
> ***Manual of City-Building*** is one of the holy texts used by the faithful of the [[Deity|god]] [[Abadar]], the Master of the [[First Vault]]. Usually quite large and bound in heavy leather for protection, it contains an abundance of advice on founding towns and developing them into cities, including plans for infrastructure, trade, defenses, utilities, expansion, and other topics related to urban planning. The Church revises the text every few years to keep up with new developments in this field; older copies often contain an appendix with countless expansions, revisions, and footnotes. It is generally housed in a sanctified space within a settlement's oldest church of Abadar, especially if that church was responsible for the city's founding. The god [[Aroden]] consulted the *Manual of City-Building* to aid in the founding of [[Taldor]] and his city-state of [[Absalom]].
