> One of [[Absalom]]'s large fortress gates, **Sally Gate** is located as the exit point between [[Westgate]] and [[The Puddles]]. This large gate is built to easily allow the use of cavalry. The gate has four massive, 60-foot-wide drawbridges to allow [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Horse|horses]] to cross outside the walls of Absalom and, all throughout the interior of the fortification, ramps allow cavalry access, even up onto the walls of Absalom themselves.
> The current commander of Sally Gate is [[Winton of House Nimz]],the commander of Absalom's [[Kortos Cavalry]].
