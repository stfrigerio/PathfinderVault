**Hocum's Fantasmagorium** once served [[Kintargo]] as a strange mix between a museum and a freak-show, but it has been closed for decades now. The boarded-up Hocum's Fantasmagorium is located in the northern end of the [[Redroof]] district, and unlike the majority of the district's buildings, it is constructed from Kintargo's distinctive white limestone rather than redbrick.


## History and exhibits

> Hocum's Fantasmagorium was built in [[4641 AR]] by Braedan "Hocum" Azperex to bring a little joy back to the city after the horrors of the [[CheliaxHistory|Chelish Civil War]].
> During its heyday, the Fantasmagorium boasted several halls of exhibits:

> - The **Hall of Cryptids** displayed a misidentified [[Cyclops|cyclops]] skull as well as the skeletons of a pair of [[Sasquatch|sasquatches]].
> - The **Hall of the Seas** once contained live exhibits, mostly common local [[Fish|fish]], but the collection also included a four-armed [[Reefclaw|reefclaw]] and a pair of [[Ningyo|ningyos]] misidentified as '[[Arcadia|Arcadian]] [[Merfolk|Mermaids]]'.
> - The **Insect Zoo** included the remains of giant insects, including a [[Scarab beetle|scarab beetle]], a [[Giant ant|giant ant]], and a [[Giant centipede|giant centipede]].
> - The **Wax Gallery** was a wax museum dedicated to local heroes, celebrities, and myths, including the infamous [[Mangvhune|Temple Hill Slasher]].
> - The **Hall of Historical Truths** was, in fact, dedicated entirely to displays about rumours and urban legends.
> Whilst Braedan Azperex's showmanship and charisma ensured that Hocum's Fantasmagorium was initially successful, once the novelty wore off, the business struggled. Within 20 years, Hocum's Fantasmagorium had closed its doors for good.


### Secret monastery

> Unknown to almost all, the building was secretly purchased by the [[Sacred Order of Archivists]], a secret society of [[Irori|Iroran]] scholars dedicated to preserving the true history of [[Cheliax]]. Beneath Hocum's Fantasmagorium, they expanded the building's basement and created the secret Many-Steps Monastery.
> The Sacred Order and their secret headquarters were destroyed by lackeys of [[Barzillai Thrune|Lord-Mayor Barzillai Thrune]] during the [[KintargoHistory|Night of Ashes]]. Much its contents, including texts and artwork from pre-Thrune Cheliax, were captured by Barzillai in the raid.
