> The submerged chambers beneath the **Gold Phoenix Aviary**, a structure also called the **Golden Phoenix Aviary**, are described by [[Pathfinder]] [[Escobar Vellian]] in [[Pathfinder ChroniclesVolume 13|Volume 13]] of the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]*. Rumours that they may contain some of the treasure of [[Ammelon VI]], last patriarch of the lost empire of [[Ghol-Gan]], have caused hundreds to die in search of it, but most of the treasure remains undiscovered. The Gold Phoenix Aviary is a vast grotto hidden in the forested depths of the [[Sodden Lands]]. The Gold Phoenix Aviary is only really reachable via a series of winding passages that link it with the ruined [[Xanthuun|Temple of Xanthuun]] as it is protected by powerful [[Illusion|illusion]] [[Magic|magic]]. Inside the aviary itself is filled with lush coconut, fig, and kapok trees. The aviary is named for its primary resident, the majestic [[Phoenix|phoenix]] Erenkrest, who has lived there since before the Ghol-Gan civilisation collapsed during [[Earthfall]].
> Erenkrest's unique appearance includes pure white feathers edged in [[Gold|gold]]. Beyond the usually potent magical abilities shared by all phoenixes, Erenkrest is supposedly able to grant *wishes* to [[Mortal|mortals]]. Before the fall of Ghol-Gan, its last patriarch [[Ammelon VI]] captured Erenkrest and wished that she would never leave the Gold Phoenix Aviary until his [[Soul|soul]] departed the [[Material Plane]] to meet its final reward in the [[Boneyard]]. Ammelon died during Earthfall, but his soul still lingers as a [[Bestiary/Ghost|ghost]] trapped in the deepest bowels of Xanthuun, and Erenkrest—true to her word—remains at the Gold Phoenix Aviary.
