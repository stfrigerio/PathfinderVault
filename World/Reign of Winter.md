Every 100 years, the [[Baba Yaga|Witch Queen Baba Yaga]] returns to the nation of [[Irrisen]] to place a new daughter on the throne, but this time, something has gone wrong. Far to the south, an unseasonable winter cloaks the forest near the village of [[Heldren]] with summer snows. When the heroes venture into the wood in search of a missing noblewoman, they discover a magical portal to the frozen land of Irrisen, whose magical winter will soon engulf all of Golarion unless they can discover the fate of the otherworldly witch Baba Yaga, a quest that will take them through snowbound Irrisen to even stranger lands beyond.

The heroes must explore three ancient, mystically linked dungeons in search of more clues to the fate of the Queen of Witches, but they must also contend with savage [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] and demon-worshiping [[Frost giant|frost giants]] who seek to claim Baba Yaga's secrets for themselves.

Continuing their search for Baba Yaga, the heroes take the Dancing Hut to the planet of [[Triaxus]], seventh world in Golarion's solar system, now in the middle of its decades-long winter. The heroes soon find themselves embroiled in a conflict between the dragonriders of the Skyfire Mandate and the barbarian armies of a white dragon warlord in their hunt for more clues to the whereabouts of Baba Yaga. Will the PCs ally with one of the warring factions to get the information they need, or will their quest come to an end on a distant, alien world?

The search for the Queen of Witches finally ends when the Dancing Hut travels to Baba Yaga's homeland of Russia on the planet Earth. The year is 1918, and the First World War rages throughout Europe. The heroes find themselves in the wilds of Siberia, where they must face Russian soldiers armed with 20th-century technology to infiltrate an ancient monastery and rescue Baba Yaga from her estranged son, [[Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin|Grigori Rasputin]]. Can the heroes kill the "Mad Monk," who has already cheated death once before, and free Baba Yaga, or will they too fall before the horrors of modern war?

Baba Yaga has been rescued from the clutches of her son Rasputin, but the Queen of Witches remains trapped inside a magical matryoshka doll.

The campaign reaches its climax when the heroes finally face Queen Elvanna, fourteenth daughter of Baba Yaga, inside the Dancing Hut's innermost sanctum. Will the heroes defeat Elvanna and finally free Baba Yaga, or will their failure plunge Golarion into a new ice age ruled by the Witch Queen of Irrisen?

***[[Irrisen Land of Eternal Winter]]***

**Written by** [[Mike Shel]]

**Released** January 2013


Far to the north lies a realm that the seasons never touch, where snow lies heavy on the ground all year and winter never releases its icy grip. A country ruled by [[White witch|White Witches]] with hearts as cold as the north wind—the daughters of the Queen of Witches herself, [[Baba Yaga]]—and supported on the backs of a conquered, enslaved people. A place where [[Frost giant|frost giants]] and hateful fey are respected citizens, and [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]] stalk the streets in human form. This is the nation of [[Irrisen]], a land cloaked in unceasing winter for 1,400 years. *Irrisen, Land of Eternal Winter* presents a comprehensive overview of this frigid kingdom, where the imperious control of the ruling class stifles the residents just as strongly as the harsh, never-ending winter.

Whether they're hardened natives or arctic adventurers, everyone in the northern lands walks a fine line between finding wealth and glory and filling a shallow grave in the bloody snow. *People of the North* presents a player-focused, in-depth discussion of the northern nations of the Inner Sea region.
