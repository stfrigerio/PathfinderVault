> **Kaijitsu Manor** may physically be the smallest of [[Sandpoint]]'s noble houses, but due to the success of the founding family that lends the structure its name it also boasts the greatest displays of wealth. The home of the Kaijitsu family is situated atop the bluffs south of town, alongside other homes of the community's influential families.



## Appearance

> Located along the bluffs overlooking the [[Varisian Gulf]], Kaijitsu Manor is relatively small for a manor house owned by one of Sandpoint's founding families. However, the building's interior is well furnished in rare and expensive styles, all provided for as a result of the success seen by the [[Sandpoint Glassworks]].


## Notable Individuals

> Having been the home of three generations of the Kaijitsu family, this building has been home to a fair share of Sandpoint's nobility.
