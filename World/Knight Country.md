> The upper reaches of [[Azlanti Keep]] in [[Absalom]] are known as **Knight Country**, since it is the domain of siege engineers, specialists, and senior members of the [[First Guard]], and requires a badge for entry. The rooms are expansive and well-decorated, although windows and balconies are reserved for siege equipment. [[Lord Gyr]] is known to maintain a private room in this area.
