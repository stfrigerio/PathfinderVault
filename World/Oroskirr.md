> **Oroskirr**, also known as **the Opal Island** or **the Ever-Watching Eye**, is a strange, opalescent dome that rises from the waters of the [[Nyvyrd]] in northern [[Iobaria]]. The dome glows and crackles with energy every night, and draws lightning to its surface during thunderstorms. Its surface has never been breached, but locals presume it is the source of the Nyvyrd's unusually warm waters.
