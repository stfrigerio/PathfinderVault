Monks test one another.
> The **monk** seeks perfection in all things, including themselves: body and mind. Monks tend to keep a clear head, mediating and contemplating the meaning of existence, but when danger comes they are able to utilize their body as a deadly weapon, instantly unleashing a flurry of blows.
> The warrior monk of [[Golarion]] is a recent addition to the lives of the peoples of the [[Inner Sea region]]. The combination of religious devotion, self-perfection, and martial combat is an import from the far regions of [[Vudra]] and [[Tian Xia]]. Monks are perhaps the rarest class in Golarion, outnumbered even by the elite [[Paladin|paladins]].
> Monks more commonly learn from wandering masters—those who have seceded from their school, or have been sent to spread their teachings to the outside world. Each master carries with them a retinue of loyal apprentices—potential monks that learn habits of body and mind from their elder.



## Regions

> In the Inner Sea region, the most notable and numerous monastic schools can be found on the island nations of [[Hermea]] and [[Jalmeray]]. These are likely the only places in the Inner Sea where one can find more than a handful of monks in one place. The regions surrounding the [[Crown of the World]], being a frequent route of crossing from Tian, also have their share of monks who often stop to take on apprentices.
> [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]], despite their fame for monastic traditions, have been slow to adapt to this new way of life and still produce very few warrior monks from a select group of schools. Each monk school represents a specific way of life—a set of principles, practices, and philosophies, that combine with a unique [[Fighting style|fighting style]] to distinguish a practicing monk from his peers.
> In [[Osirion]], the mountain monastery of [[Tar Kuata]] houses monks and scholars of [[Irori]] as well as an order of elite [[Dwarf|dwarven]] martial artists called the [[Ouat]].
> Monks from all over the world flock to [[Jalmeray]] to hone their bodies and minds, following esoteric traditions handed down in antiquity by otherworldly spirits. There they can learn martial arts in the greatest of [[Jalmeray|Jalmerays]] many monastic orders known collectively as the [[Houses of Perfection]].
> Finally, temples of [[Irori]] found throughout the Inner Sea region have begun training monks to help spread the worship of their god.


## Races

> Any race might be inclined to the life of a monk. The orders are so small that the chances of finding any given race are almost equal. The lawful races have a natural disposition to the demands of monastic life, whereas the more chaotic races such as [[Orcs|orcs]] are not likely to find the life tolerable.
> There are no restrictions on the race of a monk, but [[Dwarf|dwarf]], [[Halfling|halfling]], [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], [[Duskwalker|duskwalker]], [[Tiefling|tiefling]], [[Android|android]], [[Suli|suli]], [[Strix|strix]] and [[Grippli|grippli]] adventurers often become monks.


## Religion

> [[Irori]], the god of perfection, is a willing patron of monastic traditions. Those who seek physical and mental perfection are often drawn to his church, and may find their way into a monastery in the process. Likewise, those drawn to the martial traditions find Irori a useful deity in their pursuits, and this in turn might lead them to pursue the art of the monk.
> There are many monks who look inward for guidance, rather than outward, and choose not to worship any deities whatsoever.


## Ex-monks

> Monks adhere to a set of rules and precepts that often govern their behavior, dress, or diet, and which is dictated by their governing [[Philosophy|philosophy]] or school of thought. Those who lose faith, or give up their principles retain the skills and supernatural abilities they have learned, but can no longer increase these abilities. This makes them different from classes whose powers are bestowed upon them by a [[God|divine entity]] (such as [[Paladin|paladins]]), who lose all but their martial skills when they betray their code.
