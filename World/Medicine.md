### Acupuncture

> Acupuncture as a non-magical healing technique was pioneered by the famous healers of [[Chu Ye]].


### Anatomy

> Anatomy concerns the structure of living things: [[Human|humans]] and other [[Humanoid|humanoids]], [[Animal|animals]], monsters and plants. It is studied by healers to better effect their craft and is taught at universities specializing in medicine (see below). Unfortunately, the study of anatomy may also be used for more nefarious activities such as aiding torture.


#### Draconic anatomy

*See also: [[Dragon]]*
> The anatomy of [[Dragon|dragons]] is particularly well understood, and it is clear that dragons have many elements within their anatomy that are unique.


### Apothecary and herbalism

*For a list of apothecary's shops in Golarion, see [[CategoryApothecary's shops|Apothecarys Shops]]*
*For a list of herb shops in Golarion, see [[CategoryHerb shops|Herb Shops]]*
> Apothecaries and herbalists use their skills to provide substances, such as medicines, to aid healing. This study can be used for darker purposes, such as the manufacture of [[Poisons of Golarion|poisons]] and illicit [[Recreational drugs of Golarion|drugs]].


### Chirurgery

*See [[Surgery and chirurgery]] below.*

### Dentistry

> The care of teeth.


### Herbalism

*See [[Apothecary and herbalism]] above.*

### Relaxation techniques

> The use of relaxation techniques, such as massage, was pioneered by the famous healers of [[Chu Ye]].


### Surgery and chirurgery

> Surgery, sometimes denoted as chirurgery, is the branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis and treatment of injury, deformity, and disease by manual and instrumental means. This is a skilled exercise usually learned at a [[CategoryUniversities|university]].
> The [[Mi-go|mi-go]] are known to perform surgery on creatures using their specialized claws as a defense or form of attack, and have mastered surgical technologies.


### Trepanation

> **Trepanation** is the practice of relieving pressure in the brain to heal and strengthen themselves of mental conditions, [[Curses of Golarion|curses]], and forms of compulsion.


## In religion

> Healing magic usually comes from the gods. [[Cleric|Clerics]] of all good-aligned deities may spontaneously convert any spell they have learned into a spell capable of curing wounds. Nevertheless, certain gods are particularly associated with medicine and healing:

> - [[Bolka]], the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] goddess of marriage
> - [[Furcas]], the [[Infernal duke|infernal duke]] of herbalism
> - [[Irori]], the god of enlightenment and self-perfection
> - [[Jiraviddain]], a mysterious infernal duke
> - [[Korada]], an [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]]
> - [[Lorcan]], another mysterious infernal duke
> - [[Milani]], the patron of all those who fight against oppression and unjust rule
> - [[Pharasma]], goddess of birth, death, fate, and prophecy
> - [[Qi Zhong]], the Master of Medicine
> - [[Sarenrae]], goddess of healing, honesty, redemption, and the [[Sun|sun]]
> Some of these deities may also grant powers to restore abilities stripped by magical effects, or to resurrect the dead.
> Pharasma has other associations with medicine: she is a goddess with aspects associated with both birth and death. Midwives and those dealing with the dead are often servants or followers of Pharasma.
> Sarenrae is also a patron goddess of healing: healing is a part of her broader portfolio. Her church is therefore well known for its caring of the sick.
> Like Sarenrae, Qi Zhong is the [[Tian Xia]] pantheon's patron of both healing and medicine, and many involved in these studies worship him.
> [[Aroden]] bequeathed Golarion with his holy text, *[[The History and Future of Humanity]]*, which contains a treatise on medicine.
> The [[Psychopomp usher|psychopomp usher]] [[Dammar]] the Denied is the usher of medicine and doctors but also of [[Alcohol|alcohol]] and those who make it, ostensibly for its medical uses, though legends also tell that the Denied invented hangovers.


## In technology

> Pharmaceuticals are [[Technology|technological]] applications of medical concepts, more advanced and versatile than other non-magical methods but limited in scope to [[Numeria]] and the [[Technic League]] that controls such discoveries. An especially complex example is the [[Autodoc|autodoc]], a [[Technology|technological]] device capable of performing many kinds of medical procedures on a patient.


## In practice

> Many of the gods are associated with medicine and healing. On a more practical level, moreover, the gods are often the source of healing by granting their servants—such as [[Cleric|clerics]], [[Paladin|paladins]], and other divine spellcasters—spells and other abilities that can cure wounds, [[Poisons of Golarion|poisons]], diseases, or the [[Curses of Golarion|curses]] associated with supernatural afflictions, or even bring a patient back from the dead. These abilities are often associated with the [[Magic/Conjuration]] school of magic.
> Some arcane spellcasters also have access to the Conjuration school's healing spells. Such healing comes not from the gods but from raw magic itself. This capability is used by the followers of [[Razmir]], who provide arcane-based healing as a ruse to help convince non-believers that Razmir is indeed divine.
> Mundane healing is also available, and in the god-rejecting country of [[Rahadoum]] is the only medical help available. Practitioners can buy herbs, drugs, and other mundane healing substances and tools to aid in mundane medical practices. (See "[[Apothecary and herbalism]]" above.)


## In organizations

*For a list of hospitals and similar healing establishments, see [[CategoryHospitals|Hospitals]]*.
> Medicine is taught at a number of institutions in Golarion, including:

> - [[Alabaster Academy]] in [[Kintargo]], [[Cheliax]] specializing in [[Botany|botany]], medicine, and zoology.
> - The [[University of Lepidstadt]], in [[Ustalav]].
