> A **printing press** is a [[Technological|technological]] device that can mass-produce [[List of written works|printed works]]. Printing presses can range from labor-intensive, hand-cranked mechanical devices that press ink from reverse-carved plates onto paper, to rarer, costly, but vastly more efficient movable-type presses, and even [[Magic|magical]] contraptions capable of automated, rapid print production. The existence of printing presses help spread literacy, and help people organize and spread information.



## Broadsheets

***Main article: [[Broadsheet]]***
> A broadsheet is a printed publication (generally on a single, large piece of paper) designed to inform the public about local, current events. They are published in most large metropolises that have access to government-backed printing presses.


## On Golarion

> Printing presses are expensive, but not uncommon, on [[Golarion]]. In the [[Inner Sea region]] alone, movable-type presses capable of multi-color printing exist in wealthy nations such as [[Andoran]], [[Cheliax]], [[Galt]], [[Nex]], and [[Alkenstar]]. However, standard presses cannot produce [[Magic item|magic items]], such as [[Scroll|scrolls]] or [[Spellbook|spellbooks]].


### Andoran

> Government-owned printing presses are used in Andoran to print government documents throughout the year. During elections, those running for office are allowed to access these very expensive presses for a small fee in order to print their own campaign literature. This is to ensure that even those without significant financial resources can get their voices heard.


### Tian Xia

> The more complex writing systems of [[Tien]] languages stymie most efforts in [[Tian Xia]] to produce compatible printing presses, though there are rumors that the [[Southern Tiger Lodge]] of the [[Pathfinder Society]] is experimenting with clockwork devices derived from technology stolen from [[Pan Majang]].


### Pezzack

***Main article: [[Pezzack]]***
> Printing presses play a pivotal role in the rebellion of [[Pezzack]] against [[Cheliax]]. Despite imperial authorities seizing all presses in the city, rebels continue to produce inflammatory pamphlets and works that spread far beyond its walls despite an ongoing blockade. Many of these works are produced by a revolutionary known only as the Printsmith.


### Hellknights

> A printing press arguably inspired the first [[Hellknights]], [[Daidian Ruel]], and the creation of the [[Order of the Rack]]. Ruel burned Misirnis Taranik—a philosopher, scholar, and cultist of [[Sifkesh]]—in [[4577 AR]] after discovering that she spread the [[White Plague]] across [[Westcrown]] through her scriptora and binding houses. Ruel's discovery of her woodblock press in the ruins of [[Taranik House]] inspired and helped spread his doctrine of "low philosophy," which led to the Order of the Rack's creation and its continued interest in maintaining and publishing an "official" Chelish history.
