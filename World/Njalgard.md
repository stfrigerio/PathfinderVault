> **Njalgard** was the name of the land claimed by the nine koffars of the [[Ulfen]] strongholds in northwest [[Casmaron]]. The nation was founded by the survivors of an Ulfen expedition who settled on the northeastern shores of the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]] in what would become [[Okormirr]]. 
> Njalgard reached its end in [[905 AR]] when [[Iobar I|Iobar the Potent]], heir to the throne of [[Orlov]], bested the eight other koffars in trial by combat, usurping their rule and uniting all of Njalgard into the nation of [[Iobaria]].
