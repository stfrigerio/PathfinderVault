> The **Soulsheen Baths** are well-known hot springs found in the town of [[Brimstone Springs]] high in the [[Mindspin Mountains]] of [[Nidal]]. The waters have high mineral and sulfur content, and cascade naturally through the town, which gives Brimstone Springs a distinctive odor. Hundreds visit every year to take advantage of the waters' supposed [[Healing|healing]] properties. Their greatest notoriety comes from the golden dream, a poisoned water immersion that (if it fails to kill the person), gives the person a vision of their afterlife.
