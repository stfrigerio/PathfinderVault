> The Pagoda of the Mantis is the temple to [[Achaekek]] in [[Ilizmagorti]] in [[Mediogalti]]. Situated in the Redshore district, it is the city's largest temple. It is open to all, but legend has it that unbelievers are magically marked by the god as soon as they step over the threshold â€“ and are promptly murdered by the rest of the congregation.
> The priests of this temple are not associated with the splinter cult of Achaekek known as the [[Merry Widows]], who operate from [[Slitherfish Island]] to the east.
