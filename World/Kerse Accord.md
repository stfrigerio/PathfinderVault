> The peace treaty known as the **Kerse Accord** was signed in [[2332 AR]] at [[Highhelm Militia]]'s Council Building, and ended the 700-year-long civil war (the 19th [[Five Kings Wars]]) between the five [[Dwarf|dwarven]] kingdoms in the [[Five Kings Mountains]] ([[Gardadth]], [[Saggorak]], [[Doggadth]], [[Grakodan]], and [[Taggoret (city)|Taggoret]]).
> The negotiations for the treaty succeeded with the help of a delegation from [[Druma]], who were brought in to broker a peace between the bellicose dwarven nations. Great towering [[Carved Kings|sculptures of the five kings]] who signed the Accord were carved into the highest peaks of the mountains to commemorate the event. As a result, Highhelm became a location of prominence and hosted a permanent council formed from delegates of the five kingdoms. The treaty also resulted in the [[Human|humans]] of Druma being granted access to the incredible mineral resources of the Five Kings Mountains, greatly increasing the [[Druma|Kalistocracys]] wealth.
> Peace between the five dwarven kingdoms lasted until [[2497 AR]], when all of Gardadth—except for the city of Highhelm—fell to an orc onslaught.
