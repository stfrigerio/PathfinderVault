> **Wolfpoint** is the name of an [[Isger|Isgeri]] fort located north of the [[Chitterwood]] on the [[Conerica River]], about 25 miles southwest of the town of [[Saringallow]]. It houses approximately 300 soldiers and their officers, many of whom are veterans of the recent [[Goblinblood Wars]]. The fort itself consists of several wooden barracks surrounded by a tall log palisade. Much of the palisade was destroyed during the wars and has since been rebuilt, although many sections still show signs of fire damage and [[Goblin|goblin]] blood.
