> The **House of the Silken Veil** is a temple and bawdy house dedicated to the deity [[Calistria]]. It is located in the [[Leeward District]] of [[Riddleport]].


## Appearance

> The temple is an octagonal pyramid topped with a blood-red steeple. Although the once-white marble walls have long since been stained by years of exposure to salt from the ocean and the pollutants from the [[Gas Forges]], the [[Silk|silken]] curtains that cover the three entrances are always clean and fresh. Inside the temple, the air is filled with exotic incense.


## Services

> Like most temples to Calistria, the House of the Silken Veil serves as a brothel as well as a place of worship. The prostitutes working here are trained in coaxing information from their clients, which is then sold to others. These secrets have made the madam of the house, [[Shorafa Pamodae]], very influential and wealthy.
> As well as "hospitality", the House of the Silken Veil is also believed to be a place where thugs and assassins are trained. They are known to quote extracts from the holy text *Blood for Wine* before fulfilling their grim tasks.
