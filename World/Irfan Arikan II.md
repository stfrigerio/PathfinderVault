> **Irfan Arikan II** was the final [[Qadira|Qadiran]] governor of [[Osirion]]. His palace at [[Sothis]] was seized by the church of [[Sarenrae]] to create the [[Temple of the Eternal Sun]] after the church conspired to bring [[Khemet I]] to power. Having struck a deal with Khemet I a year before his rule officially began, the church of Sarenrae contributed many of the palace's furnishings to the construction of the [[Palace of the Forthbringer]].
