> Touched off by powerful earthquakes, the [[Volcano|volcano]] known as [[Droskar's Crag|Droskars Crag]] (in the [[Five Kings Range]]) erupted on 18 [[Desnus]] [[3980 AR]] in an event known to historians as the **Rending**.


## History

> In 3980 AR, a [[Human|human]] [[Wizard|wizard]] named Ilgreth [[Enslaved|enslaved]] the [[Gold dragon|gold dragon]] [[Mengkare]] using the *[[Orb of Dragonkind|orb of gold dragonkind]]* and sent him to his workshop in [[Droskar's Crag|Torags Crag]]. A group of heroes tracked down the wizard and helped Mengkare break free of the wizard's [[Spell|spell]]. Once free of the wizard's control, Mengkare destroyed the *gold orb of dragonkind*, which set off a chain reaction causing the volcano to erupt.
> The Rending destroyed [[Jernashall]], the subterranean capital of the dwarven empire of [[Tar Khadurrm]], and its sister city of [[Raseri Kanton]] on the surface. In Jernashall, a river of lava spewed forth from the great magmafall in the center of the city and killed every citizen within minutes. The fate of Raseri Kanton was just as horrifying: the whole city fell into the earth.
> The Rending did what centuries of war and conflict never could, finally break the spirit of the dwarven people. The Rending marks the beginning of the decline of the dwarves, as they fell into apathy and indifference.
> The nearby community of [[Darkmoon Vale]] (then still part of [[Taldor]]) was also hit particularly hard, and parts of [[Almas]] were destroyed by massive flooding caused by the melting of the snow pack around Droskar's Crag.
> The earthquake also opened a connection of the [[Candlestone Caverns]] to the surface.
