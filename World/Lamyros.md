> **Lamyros** or lamia-kin are a related group of creatures born of a terrible curse in ancient times.  They include the more common [[Lamia|lamias]], the [[Harridan|harridans]], [[Hungerer|hungerers]], [[Kuchrima|kuchrimas]], and [[Lamia matriarch|lamia matriarchs]]. Strange and bestial in nature, they are seen as the children of [[Lamashtu]], the Mother of Monsters. Although the cat-bodied lamia, the least powerful of their kind, can be found throughout the [[Inner Sea region]], they are particularly common in [[Varisia]] and the [[Hold of Belkzen]] due to their ancient connection with [[Thassilon]]. It is there that the more powerful members of their species can be found.
