> **Phlegethon** (pronounced FLEG-uh-thon) is the fourth layer of [[Hell]], and is known as "Hell's Forges".
> It is within these infernal forges that [[Soul|souls]] are melted down, amidst the clang of [[Hammer|hammers]] and the stench of burning flesh. Once purified of weakness and rebellion, these souls are recast into the forms of true [[Devil|devils]].
> It is ruled by the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Belial]], known as the Father of Whores, who oversees the mass creation of Hell's armaments as well as the designing of new weapons of war.
