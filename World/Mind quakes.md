> **Mind quakes** are an affliction linked to the [[Dominion of the Black]] and [[Aucturn]] known to affect people around the [[Inner Sea region]].


## In northern Avistan

> This affliction affected many people in [[Numeria]] and [[Sarkoris]] shortly after an explosion in [[Silver Mount]] killed an entire tribe in [[-3116 AR]]. Those afflicted were overwhelmed with alien thoughts, [[Science|sciences]], and strange emotions. [[Ramlock]], then a priest of [[Desna]], was the only known afflicted person who did not end up going on a killing spree that ended with their own deaths.


## In Osirion

> Mind quakes are referenced in some [[Ancient Osirian]] hieroglyphs alluding to the [[Dominion of the Black]], which suggest that mind quakes offer unspecified gifts to some and "obliteration" to others. Radical [[Osirionologist|Osirionologists]] believe this suggests a link between Osirion's rapid [[Magic|magical]] and [[Technology|technological]] advancement and alien influence, and that the [[Aucturn]]-fanatic [[Pharaoh of Numbers]] might have been afflicted with mind quakes.
> The [[Androsphinx of Zukebri]], located near other monuments built by the [[Four Pharaohs]], emits a continuous scream of [[Psychic energy|psychic energy]] reportedly similar to mind quakes. Few are immune to its overwhelming effects, and those who are immune share no obvious commonalities save for a [[Psychic magic|psychic]] potential. It is unclear what purpose the Androsphinx serves.
> The Veinstone Pyramid contains a chamber of hieroglyphs that links the Dominion of the Black to both mind quakes and the four [[Pharaohs of Ascension]].
