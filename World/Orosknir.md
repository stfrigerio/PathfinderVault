> **Orosknir**, the **Eye Mount**, is the tallest mountain in [[Iobaria|Iobarias]] [[Syrzemyan Highlands]], its lone peak towering above all its peers. Carved into Orosknir's eastern face is a massive eye which has never been covered by the snowpack despite its elevation. This eye flashes with unknown magical energies every few decades, though many suspect these energies are somehow related to Iobaria's frequent [[Diseases of Golarion|plagues]].
