 Dolok Darkfur, an [[Eidolon|eidolon]] worshipped as a [[Deity|god]] by the [[Sarkoris|Sarkorian]] [[Farheaven Clan]].
> **God callers** are the predominant religious leaders of the native people of [[Sarkoris]]. A god caller is typically a [[Summoner|summoner]] whose [[Eidolon|eidolon]] is revered as a [[Deity|god]] by the followers of that god caller. The eidolons [[Summoned|summoned]] by god callers typically resemble [[Animal|animals]] native to the region, such as [[Bear|bears]] or [[Wolf|wolves]], with prominent unusual features such as feathers or wings. The beliefs, edicts, dispositions, and [[Ritual|rituals]] of god callers and their followers all vary widely from group to group.
> With the closure of the [[Worldwound]] and the return of many Sarkorians to their native homeland, the tradition of **god calling** has seen a resurgence. Having returned to Sarkoris after long exiles in distant lands, god callers and their gods are even more diverse in appearance and customs than before.


## False gods

> In some circles away from Sarkoris, the concept of god calling is denigrated as the worship of false gods. Evidence cited is the lack of divine power granted by the eidolon.
