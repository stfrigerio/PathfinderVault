> **Shadowsquare** is the second-largest temple in [[Kintargo]], [[Cheliax]], after the politically dominant [[Temple of Asmodeus Kintargo|Temple of Asmodeus]]. Devoted to [[Zon-Kuthon]], it is located in the north-eastern part of the Temple Hill district.



## History

> Shadowsquare was built atop the remains of a temple of [[Cayden Cailean]] that burned down during the early part of the [[Chelish Civil War]].


## Appearance

> The temple resembles a truncated pyramid, sloping toward the top in such a way that some part of it is always wrapped in shadows.


## Clergy and congregation

> Despite its large size, the temple has a very small congregation and is unpopular in Kintargo. It exists solely to help cement political relations with neighbouring [[Nidal]]. Similarly, it boasts only a small contingent of priests led by [[Aluceda Zhol|High Priest Aluceda Zhol]], and rumours around the city suggest that she is intimately involved with Kintargo's [[Asmodeus|Asmodean]] [[Corinstian Grivenner|High Priest Corinstian Grivenner]]. Her true dark secret, however, is that she is a [[Vampire|vampire]].
> Shadowsquare has to resort to selling magical [[Healing|healing]] and [[Magic item|items]] to help with the meagre income from its parishioners, and is known to have a powerful *[[Scroll|scroll of]] restoration* for sale.
