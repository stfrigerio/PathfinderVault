> The Starling House is the most elegant house in the city of [[Karcau]] in [[Ustalav]]. It is the ancestral home of the House Livgrace, [[Sinaria]]'s line of ruling counts. The house is made of pale stone and located across the Echo's Inlet, hidden amid the cottonwoods and hanging moss from Karcau's harbor. [[Sasandra Livgrace|Countess Sasandra Livgrace]] treats the somewhat outdated house as her personal sanctuary and holds court informally from the grim office of her father, [[Birmienon Livgrace|Count Birmienon Livgrace]] at the Starling House. From the lofty widow's walk the Countess often overlooks her city and the beautiful [[Lake Prophyria]]. The house doesn't have a connection to the dangerous city's sewers and Sasandra appreciates this fact.
