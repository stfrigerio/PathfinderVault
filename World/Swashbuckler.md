> **Swashbucklers** are lightly-armored combatants with a flair for intricate combat styles and agile attacks. If a swashbuckler has to do something, it will be done with style. Deeply committed to a technical mastery of combat, swashbucklers combine discipline and daring to commit feats of advanced martial prowess, dancing around the battlefield, and carefully setting up their foes for powerful—and spectacular—final blows.
