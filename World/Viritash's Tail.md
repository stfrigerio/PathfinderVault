> **Viritash's Tail** is an unholy valley within the section of the [[Pardaparbat Mountains]] that lies within the [[Narhari Desert]]. Viritash's Tail is named after the [[Evil|evil]] [[Vudra|Vudran]] [[Dragon|dragon]] [[Deity|god]] [[Viritash]], and at the heart of the valleys lies a scepter of incredible potency made from Viritash's own severed tail. The land surrounding Viritash's Tail is incredibly dangerous as it is filled with numerous [[Linnorm|linnorms]] and other corrupt dragons fighting to try and claim the scepter for themselves.
