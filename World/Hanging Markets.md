> The **Hanging Markets** district of [[Algidheart]] is located at the city's very center surrounded by the seven other [[Soaring Districts]]. It consists of a large number of platforms suspended from the surrounding impossibly high buildings. Foodstuffs and all kinds of wares from across [[Golarion]], as well as all kinds of services, may be purchased at its bazaars. The control of Hanging Markets has been the traditional privilege of [[Jadwiga|Jadwiga Morgannan]] since the foundation of Algidheart thirteen centuries ago, which is the provisional capital of [[Bleakmarch]] in [[Irrisen]]. [[Riina Morgannan|Lady Riina Morgannan]] is the current mistress of the Hanging Markets.
