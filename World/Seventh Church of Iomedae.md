 Iomedae's [[Holy symbol|holy symbol]].
> The **Seventh Church of Iomedae** is an important temple of [[Deity|goddess]] in the [[Ascendant Court]] district of [[Absalom]], and the site of the [[Acts of Iomedae|seventh of Iomedaes 11 miraculous acts]], the calling of the Undying Light. This miracle is commemorated by the temple itself and the **Iomedaenne**, a 10-foot statue of the goddess carved from red limestone and banded with sapphires. Although the goddess is popular in the city, and the Seventh Church trains most of her [[Cleric|clerics]] here for three or four years, most of the priests at the church are young or elderly, since her most vital followers take up service elsewhere. Absalom is seen as a place of recruitment by the goddess's church, rather than a bulwark of faith in peril. The high priest of the temple is [[Tavorae Falsebane]], who replaced the aged [[Genedair the Faithful]] who passed on to his final reward. Across the main street from the church is the [[Tempering Hall]], which trains [[Paladin|paladins]] of Iomedae, as well those of the churches of [[Abadar]], [[Irori]], and [[Shelyn]].
