> [[Dwarf|Dwarven]] historians refer to the period between the fall of [[Taggoret (city)|Taggoret]] in [[2526 AR]] and the rise of [[Tar Khadurrm]] in [[3'9 AR]] as the **Wild Era**. During the nearly 700 years of the Wild Era, the [[Orc|orcs]] controlled the [[Five Kings Mountains]] and only [[Highhelm Militia]] remained to defend the dwarven and [[Human|human]] civilizations in the area.
