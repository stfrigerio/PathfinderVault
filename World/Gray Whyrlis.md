> Several millennia after the collapse of [[Ghol-Gan]] empire, two powerful [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]] known as [[Raugsmauda]] and **Gray Whyrlis** came to the [[Shackles]] and fought one another for control of the archipelago. They both uncovered the powerful sorceries that caused the doom of Ghol-Gan and attempted to harness them. In the end, however, the sorcerers failed to understand and control the powers they were using. In a disastrous incident, Gray Whyrlis was lost and Raugsmauda, heavily injured, was forced to retreat into her dungeon on [[Motaku Isle]] for centuries.
