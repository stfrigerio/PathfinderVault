> Formerly **The Black Deer Inn**, **The White Deer** is an inn and tavern, and the northernmost building in the town of [[Sandpoint]]. Rebuilt and renamed after a building at the same location burned as part of the [[Late Unpleasantness]] in [[4702 AR]], this business is owned and primarily maintained by [[Garridan Viskalai]] and his family.



## Appearance

> The White Deer is a three-story building, its lowest level built of stone while its upper floors are composed of fine wood. Its rooms are spacious and clean, and its front entrance is flanked on either side by twin deer statues of white birch.


## Services

> Priced low in order to compete with [[The Rusty Dragon]], the White Deer provides large and well-maintained lodgings. The quality of The White Deer's food matches that of its accommodations, and the peppercorn venison is considered a house specialty.


## Notable individuals

> The inn's somber [[Shoanti]] proprietor Garridan Viskalai is the brother of [[Belor Hemlock]], the sheriff of [[Sandpoint]].
