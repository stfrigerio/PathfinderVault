## History

![[Karzoug.jpg|right+hmed]] 
 Karzoug as runelord, with his [[Karzoug's burning glaive|burning glaive]].

### Early enslavement

> Karzoug was born in [[-5836 AR]], during the reign of Runelord [[Haphrama]], in the city of Malistoke as a [[Slave|slave]] to the [[Lich|lich]] [[Zinlun]]. Most details about his early life are unknown, removed from historical records by his command. At the age of 27, Karzoug tricked Zinlun into selling him to a [[Cannibalism|cannibal]] in a fit of pique; he then killed his new master and used his [[Gold|gold]] teeth to become apprentice to the [[Demon|demon]] [[Binding outsiders|binder]] Thurbel.
> Karzoug served Thurbel for seven years as a slave and lure for [[Summoned|summoned]] demons, who killed him many times, but after every death Thurbel resurrected him. During this time, he learnt [[Magic|magical]] powers, rulership, and the exercise of power from the demons.


### Deception and ascent

> When Haphrama called for new apprentices, Karzoug sabotaged one of Thurbel's [[Conjuration|conjurations]], let the summoned demon devour his master's [[Soul|soul]] and looted his belongings. With this wealth, he impressed Haphrama enough to be chosen as an apprentice, and learnt much about [[Transmutation|transmutation]] from the runelord.
> Karzoug found himself fascinated by the thinning of reality in [[Mhar Massif]], and eventually secured an alliance with the [[Denizen of Leng|almost-humans]] of [[Leng]], who secretly taught him eldritch reality-warping powers in exchange for easier access to the [[Material Plane]]. In [[-5759 AR]], Haphrama discovered Karzoug's plots, only to be killed alongside his other apprentice Vhage by a [[Spell|spell]] that the almost-humans taught Karzoug.


### Reign

> A year after succeeding Haphrama as runelord of greed, Karzoug razed his own home town of Malistoke and erased most details of his embarrassing early life as a slave. He also destroyed his first master Zinlun's lair, but failed to completely destroy the lich. In the same year, on the site where Malistoke once stood, Karzoug quarried miles of stone to build monuments, creating the [[Storval Deep]].
> During Karzoug's reign, Shalast grew in power and [[Xin-Shalast]] became one of the most breathtaking cities in [[Golarion]], though this grandeur only benefited Karzoug himself and the nobles. He ruled with corruption and ruthlessness: he once ordered an entire city to be burnt because the local tax collectors were short a few [[Currency|silvers]]. He and [[Alaznist]], ruler of [[Bakrakhan]], were in a state of perpetual warfare, constantly battling at the border between their two realms.
> In [[-5620 AR]], Karzoug built the [[Cyphergate]] and murdered its engineer Draveenzi to ensure that no one but himself would know of its secret as a [[Portal|portal]] to the [[Dimension of Time]]. Karzoug devised an [[Occult ritual|occult ritual]] to do so and travel to the past in the process, but never finished the research before [[Earthfall]].
> In [[-5353 AR]], Karzoug established [[Guiltspur]] to serve as an embassy between Shalast and Leng. In [[-5319 AR]], he achieved a triumph over his rival [[Zutha]] by stealing the *[[Shard of Gluttony]]*, which he then tasked the [[Dark Rider]] with guarding. By the end of his reign, Karzoug was the strongest runelord of greed to have ever ruled Shalast.


### Earthfall

> In order to survive [[Earthfall]] and the destruction of Thassilon, Karzoug used a *[[Runewell|runewell]]* to create a [[Demiplane|demiplane]] sanctuary known as the Eye of Avarice. After she failed to create her own *runewell*, the runelord of envy [[Belimarius]] paid Karzoug an obscene amount of money and treasure and asked for his help. Karzoug accepted the payment, but he had no intention to aid a rival, so he gave her bad advice, and Belimarius never had the time investigating Karzoug's aid to discover his trap.


### Awakening and death

> In [[4702 AR]], the [[Stone giant|stone giant]] [[Wizard|wizard]] [[Mokmurian]] accidentally triggered the *runewell* and awoke Karzoug. However, he was not yet capable of stepping out of the *runewell*, so he used his force of will to turn Mokmurian into his agent and spent the next five years gathering minions from the denizens of the ruins of Xin-Shalast. In [[4707 AR]], as Karzoug's *runewell* gathered enough power to allow him to manifest in flesh and blood in the Eye of Avarice, a group of heroes invaded it and killed Karzoug before he could properly return to the [[Material Plane]].
> Karzoug's soul travelled to the [[Boneyard]] after his death. [[Pharasma]] temporarily delayed his judgement because she knew that he was destined to be of use to another group of heroes. His soul eventually fell into the hands of the [[High Justice]], who uses it to measure the weight of sin of other souls that fell into his hands.
