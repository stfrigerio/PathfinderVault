> **Troxell** was one of the numerous small villages that sprang up in the fertile valleys between the [[West Sellen River]] and its tributary, the Tolemaida River, in the region that later would be known as the [[Lambreth|River Kingdom of Lambreth]]. It was located on the banks of the West Sellen where the river emerges from the ravines that cut through the [[Juviler Hills]]. It was a ramshackle [[Pirate|pirate]] haven and was burned to the ground in [[4328 AR]] after a tavern brawl erupted into a fully-fledged riot. In [[4394 AR]], the [[Angelidis family]] demolished the shanty town and founded the town of [[Lockridge]].
