 The Hidden Truth, a known card believed to be in the book or suit as The Yellow Prophet.
> **The Yellow Prophet** is a long-lost card in the suit of books that is the [[Harrow]]. Missing since the [[Age of Darkness]], the card depicted a hooded or veiled [[Harrower]] dressed in black and yellow whose right hand raised a hushing finger while her left drew three cards. The card symbolized complex futures, false interpretations, and self-fulfilling prophecies, and when placed in a true match, allowed the Harrower to draw three additional cards that represented potential dark futures for the subject. The card's deeper meanings have been lost to time.
