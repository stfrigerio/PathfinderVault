*This article covers the [[Psychic magic|psychic magic]] class. For philosophers of hidden realities, see [[Occultism|occultism]].*
> **Occultists** use [[Psychic magic|mental powers]] and focus-like [[Implement|implements]] to peer into the [[Occultism|resonant energies]] in their surroundings. They are also skilled with the creation of magic circles, including binding circles.
> Extremely powerful occultists who take on the mythic path of the [[Archmage|archmage]] are designated *thaumaturges*.



## Regions

> While occultists can be found across [[Golarion]], they gravitate toward sites of magical relics and ruins. This includes [[Osirion]], [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] ruins in [[Varisia]], the [[Pit of Gormuz]], and sites of ancient [[Ghol-Gan]] and [[Koloran]].


### Reliquarians

> Some occultists, known as **reliquarians**, venerate the relics of a specific [[Deity|deity]] and gain [[Divine magic|divine powers]] instead of psychic magic.


## Races

> There are no known restrictions on the race of an occultist.


## Religions

> There are no known religious restrictions on occultists. However, reliquarians must worship a deity and cannot deviate from its [[Alignment|alignment]] by more than one step.
