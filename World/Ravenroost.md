> The **Ravenroost** are ragged, broken hills just to the east of [[Sandpoint]]. It has some isolated groups of trees, such as eucalyptus, pepperwood, and pines. Some wild animals live here, but nothing particularly harmful has been reported. Flying creatures such as [[Sprite|sprites]] and [[Harpy|harpies]] and even birds, actively avoid the highest peaks.
