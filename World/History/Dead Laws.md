> The **Dead Laws** of the nation of [[Geb's Rest]] regulate relations between the nation's living and [[Undead|undead]] inhabitants and protect the rights of both sections of society. Intelligent undead have at least as many rights in Geb as living creatures.
> The laws also regulate the ownership of [[Slave|slaves]], both living and undead, and some aspects of [[Necromancy|necromancy]]. They also prohibit the channelling of [[Positive energy|positive energy]] within the nation's borders.
> Those undead who require living creatures to feed upon are provided with specially bred chattels. Of course, not everybody follows the law, so visitors to the country still need to proceed with caution.
