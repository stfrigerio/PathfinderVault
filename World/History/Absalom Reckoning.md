> **Absalom Reckoning**, or **AR** for short, is the most commonly used calendar in [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]] and possibly all of [[Golarion]]. In Absalom Reckoning, the day of the month is always listed first, followed by the month and the year and generally suffixed with the letters "AR". 



## Origin

> Absalom Reckoning takes its origin from the moment the [[Deity|god]] [[Aroden]] lifted the [[Starstone]] from the depths of the [[Inner Sea]] and founded the city of [[Absalom]], an event dated to 1 [[Abadius]], [[1 AR]]. This event also ushered in the [[Age of Enthronement]] in which [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Human|human]] nations began to be founded in the [[Inner Sea region]] inspired by Aroden's example.


## Days, weeks, months, and seasons

> In Absalom Reckoning, each day on Golarion has 24 hours, each week has seven days, and each year has 52 weeks. A year is also divided into 12 months, although once every four years an extra day is added to the end of [[Calistril]] to make up for the slight variance in the [[Planet|planets]] orbit around the [[Sun|sun]]. The last leap year was [[4720 AR]], and the next will be 4724 AR.


### Days of the week

> - **Toilday**: A work day.
> - **Wealday**: A work day.

> The Inner Sea region has four seasons: winter, spring, summer, and fall (or autumn). The months of Kuthona, Abadius, and Calistril are considered to fall in winter. Spring falls during Pharast, Gozreh, and Desna, while summer occurs during Sarenith, Erastus, and Arodus. Finally, Rova, Lamashan, and Neth are considered fall.


## Lunar Calendar

***Main article: [[Moon Golarion]]***
> Just as Absalom Reckoning is based on Golarion's orbit around its sun, some people and cultures use a **lunar calendar** that dates time using phases of the [[Moon Golarion|moon]], and where each full moon is given its own name.


## Imperial Calendar

***Main article: [[Imperial Calendar]]***
> Absalom Reckoning is by no means the only way of counting time on Golarion. On the continent of [[Tian Xia]], the most common dating method is known as the [[Imperial Calendar]], which began at the founding of [[Yixing]], Tian Xia's first empire. As this happened exactly 2,500 years before year 1 of Absalom Reckoning, converting from one date to the other is quite easy.


> Absalom Reckoning also corresponds to real-world calendars. See [[PathfinderWikiCanon policyRegarding dates|the Canon Policy]] for details.
