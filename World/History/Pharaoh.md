## Other God Kings & Pharaohs

> Although the terms 'pharaoh' and 'god king' are most associated with the rulers of Osirion, they are used in other contexts:
> - The term 'God-King' is often associated with [[Nethys]], the All-Seeing Eye who was instrumental in the coming to power of Azghaad, the First Pharaoh, prior to Nethys' ascension as a god.
> - The [[Outer God]], [[Nyarlathotep]], the Crawling Chaos, takes a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] form known as the Black Pharaoh.
> - The [[Demon lord|demon lord]], [[Areshkagal]], the  Faceless Sphinx, adopts a faceless female pharaoh as her unholy symbol.
> - Maybe, on other [[Planet|planets]], the term Pharaoh is also used by those worshipping the [[Osirian pantheon]], for instance in the [[Egypt|Old Kingdom
of Kemet]] on [[Earth]].
> - The [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnoll]] [[Hlasho]] has appropriated the title 'Pharaoh of Fangs'; he has managed to unite enough gnolls in the [[Brazen Frontier]] region to set up a settlement at [[Fort Fang]].
