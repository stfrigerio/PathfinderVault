This lesson will be focused on the history of the [[Inner Sea Region]], with particular emphasis on the empires of [[Taldor]] and [[Cheliax]]

# History

The history of [[Golarion]] spans thousands of years, and is divided into several ages.
Tragedy, sorrow, and loss define Golarion's history.
Cataclysms of various forms have undone cultural and technological advancements, periodically forcing human society into a state of relative barbarism and flux.

Two major events stand out among these, an event called the [[Earthfall]], in which a giant meteor wiped out the ancient civilizations of [[Azlant]] and [[Thassilon]], and the untimely demise of the god [[Aroden]], who was the promised god of humanity, prophesied to bring in a golden era of peace and prosperity.

The current age is called the [[Age of Lost Omens]], and the age is so named because of the failure of prophecy.
All right, no more preamble.
Let's get into the history of the world.

## Age of Creation

I'll start in the beginning.
The first age is called the [[Age of Creation]].

The creation of the world is a hotly debated subject among scholars and priests, with as many interpretations as there are philosophies and religion.

### Torag

The dwarves, for example, believe that the god [[Torag]] created the world at his great forge, striking it again and again with his hammer to get the shape he desired.
Others argue that the gods discovered the world of Golarion, rather than having created it themselves, and that their purview is much wider and more expansive than the fate of just one world. [[torag_img.png]]

Regardless of the creation myth, it is clear that for uncounted ages, mortal life did not exist upon Golarion, yet this primeval world was not empty.
Mysterious extraplanar creatures found their way to Golarion in the time of creation, and would shape the world in the years to come. [[ancient golarion.png]]

### Aboleths

In the deepest parts of the oceans, the fish-like alien race called the [[Alghollthu master|Aboleths]] ruled supreme, while upon the land, the mysterious and unknowable [[Vault Builders]] carved out vast caverns deep underground for unknown purposes. [[aboleths_pic.png]]


In the heavens, the gods themselves had a great war, and the terrible world-ending deity called [[Rovagug]] was confronted and defeated by an alliance of gods, who it is said cut open the world and sealed Rovagug in a strange dimension at the world's core.

## Age of Serpents

After the Age of Creation, before the First Age of Humanity, there was an age called the [[Age of Serpents]].
It is so called because among the first of Golarion's great empires was that of the [[Serpentfolk]], whose empire spanned the distance from the [[Mwangi]] Expanse to modern-day [[Cheliax]].

### Serpent Folks & Cyclops

The rule of the [[Serpentfolk]] did not go uncontested, however. (*See [[History of Golarion Map|Map]]*)
In western [[Garund]] and around the Isles of the [[Shackles]], the great Cyclops Empire of the [[Ghol-Gan]] challenged the hegemony of the [[Serpentfolk]].

[[cyclops empire.png]]

### Elves

Also, it is believed that in this age, the Elves first came to Golarion, building the first Ayudhara, or [[Elf Gate]]s, connecting Golarion to the Elven homeland of [[Sovyrian]], which isn't located on Golarion at all, but on a neighboring world.
The Elves made their colonies on Golarion in the forests of [[Kyonin]] in the east and [[Mierani Forest]] in the west.

### Dwarves

Deep below the surface of the earth, the [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] formed their first civilizations, but it would be millennia before they would ever discover the sky.
Humans existed in this time, but they were hunter-gatherers with no permanent settlements, and humans avoided the lands of the [[Serpentfolk]] and the [[Ghol-Gan]], who used early humans as [[Slavery|slaves]] for the construction of their ancient dwelling places.

![[human old.png|800]]

## Age of Legends

The first real date we get is around 12,000 years ago, with the rise of the first human civilization.
The year would be roughly  [[-7000 AR]] in the [[Golarion]] calendar.
This date marks the [[Age of Legend]], characterized by these first human empires.

### Azlant & Thassilon
Humanity's first civilization would also prove to be its greatest, achieving feats of magic and technology that would never again be eclipsed in the history of the world. This was the continental empire of [[Azlant]], a powerful realm of *sorcerer-kings* whose ancient monuments can still be found scattered across the Inner Sea region today.

![[Pasted image 20230524163848.png|1000]]

A second human empire, of similar power and mastery, called a [[Thassilon]], also rose near the end of the [[Age of Legend]], founded by exiles from [[Azlant]], and ruled by wizards known as [[Runelords]].
But the humans were not without their enemies, and among them were the [[Alghollthu master|Aboleths]], who had dwelt in the deep places of the world since the Age of Creation.
Using powerful magic and cosmic knowledge, the [[Alghollthu master|Aboleths]] redirected a meteor, called the [[Starstone]], to strike at the heart of the [[Azlanti Empire]].


## Age of Darkness

![[Pasted image 20230524163916.png|1000]]

This event, called the [[Earthfall]], shattered the world.
It destroyed the empires of [[Azlant]] and [[Thassilon]].
It sliced the conjoined continents of [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]] in half, and created the [[Inner Sea]].

Thus ends the [[Age of Legend]], and begins the [[Age of Darkness]].


The Earthfall cataclysm occurs in the year [[-5293 AR]]. The damage of Earthfall extends beyond the immediate impact of the collision.
Severe weather patterns, earthquakes, and tidal waves ensure that any people that survive the initial impact blast are forced to flee their homes and start anew.

Even the [[Alghollthu master|Aboleths]] who set Earthfall into motion have their own cities deep in the oceans destroyed by the cataclysm.
Great ash clouds kicked up by the meteor cover the planet, and this becomes quite literally an era of darkness.

The Age of Darkness is also characterized by the total collapse of human civilization.
Due to the devastation, the elves retreat back to [[Sovyrian]], and won't return for several thousand years.

### Orcs

About 200 years after the Earthfall cataclysm, [[orc]]s emerge onto the surface of the world, finding a dark and welcoming world, akin to the darkness of the deep tunnels and caverns they left behind.
They conquer the land now known as [[Hold of Belkzen]], and make it their homeland on the surface.

Just before the end of the [[Age of Darkness]], the dwarves too emerge onto the surface, fulfilling what they call the [[Quest for the Sky]], and establish their fortresses and [[sky citadel]]s in the [[Five Kings Mountains]] and the [[Mindspin Mountains]].
The Age of Darkness is considered to end in [[-4294 AR]], when the sky is finally clear of the dust and debris of Earthfall. (*See [[History of Golarion Map|Map]]*)

## Age of Anguish

This period is called the [[Age of Anguish]], because although humanity began to rebuild its civilization, Earthfall had sent them back to the Stone Age, and it was a slow, difficult crawl back to farming settlements and small townships from the harsh survivalism that had characterized the [[Age of Darkness]].

### First World

During this period, the planet of Golarion wasn't the only place in the cosmos suffering at this point in time.
Existing in another plane of reality is a realm of the [[Fey]], also known as the [[First World]], where [[Fey]] creatures like dryads, nymphs, sprites, and other fairy types dwell and make their home. [[first_wrold.png]]
During the Age of Anguish, the First World suffers a terrible catastrophe, and it forces the [[Fey]] creatures to flee their homes. 
Most notably among them are the [[gnome]]s, who flee to Golarion in great numbers in this period, becoming one of the more common peoples of the Inner Sea region.
![[Pasted image 20230526152241.png|1000]]
Before the end of the Age of Anguish, humanity makes significant progress towards rebuilding civilization in various parts of the Inner Sea region.

### Jistka

In northwestern [[Garund]], the [[Jistka Imperium]] is established. (*See [[History of Golarion Map|Map]]*)
In the western reaches of the [[Mwangi Expanse]], a powerful wizard named [[Jatembe]] establishes the [[Magaambya]] Academy of Arcane Learning.

Despite these two significant milestones in humanity's return to prominence, the Age of Anguish isn't considered to end until  [[-3470 AR]], when the Empire of Ancient [[Osirion]] is founded.
This begins the Age of Destiny.

## Age of Destiny

### Osirion & Shory

It starts with Ancient [[Osirion]], situated in the northeastern end of [[Garund]].

![[Valley_of_the_pyramids.jpg|500]] 

In this period, human civilization flourished in northern [[Garund]], with the [[Jistka Imperium]] in the east, the [[Tekritanin League]] in the center, and [[Osirion]] in the west.
In the south, the power and influence of [[Magaambya]] would lead to the establishment of a powerful southern empire, called the [[Shory Empire]].

By [[-1452 AR]], the [[Jistka Imperium]] collapsed, and [[Osirion]] annexed the [[Tekritanin League|Tekirtanin]] territories.
[[Osirion]], and the influence of its pharaohs, would also start to decline a short while later.

The power of these early human civilizations waxed and waned considerably in this period.

### Taldor

[[-1281 AR]] saw the founding of the second most influential empire in the Inner Sea region, second, of course, to the Ancient Azlanti Empire.

This would be [[Taldor]], situated in the southeastern corner of [[Avistan]].
Taldan mythology tells of the infant [[Taldaris]], who was raised by wild lions on the Tandak Plains, where even as a youth he is said to have performed extraordinary tasks, such as beheading a threatening [[cockatrice]] with his bare hands. [[taldaris_img.png]]

As a young man, using his skill in battle and his tactical prowess, Taldaris began a twelve-year-long war conquest that culminated in the establishment of the first unified [[Avistan|Avistinian]] Empire since the Age of Darkness.
Because of its power and influence, the language of the empire, [[Taldan]], is the lingua franca in most parts of the Inner Sea region, and it's often simply be called **common**.

As Taldan influences wax in this pre-medieval world, the influence of [[Osirion]] continue to wane.
Their empire shrinks significantly when the lands previously belonging to the [[Tekritanin League]] claim their independence.

### Aroden

The [[Shory Empire]] also collapses in [[-632 AR]], when a giant monster called the [[Tarrasque]] ravages that part of the world.

![[tarrasque_havok.png|1000]]

By [[-43 AR]], a new empire emerges just south of [[Taldor]] called [[Qadira]], beginning a border struggle between the two empires that remains unresolved even to this day.

Humanity's new calendar would begin starting years at year zero, when a miraculous event performed by a legendary figure would shape the Inner Sea region.
This man was named [[Aroden]], and he was known by several mythic titles, including The Last of the First Humans and The Last Azlanti, because he was ostensibly the last full-blooded Azlanti to ever live on [[Golarion]]. [[aroden_fullbody.png]]

In the year zero, [[Aroden]] travelled to [[Taldor]], and from there he took a ship out to the heart of the Inner Sea, the very centre of the largest impact crater from the [[Earthfall]] event.
Deep in that sea-filled crater, he found the heart of the meteorite, the [[Starstone]], and when he held it, it filled him with magic, and somehow through this magic, he was able to raise the seafloor up to the surface.
This created the [[isle of Kortos]] and the city-state of [[Absalom]], the greatest city in all the world.

Around the Starstone was erected the [[Starstone Cathedral]] (*see image inside)*, standing on a stone column in the centre of a wide and seemingly bottomless pit at the heart of Absalom's central district.
The Starstone remains protected inside, and legend states that any who should touch the stone, like Aroden himself, would be immediately ascended to Godhood.

## Age of Enthronment

This event marks the beginning of the [[Age of Enthronement]], and from here on, the years count upwards.

It is named the Age of Enthronement because it is from here on out that Aroden ascends to his metaphorical throne, Godhood.
Aroden is proclaimed the patron god of humanity.

![[aroden religion.png|1000]]

For a period, Aroden was a living [[Deity|god]], remaining on the mortal world to steer humanity.
It is said that seers and prophets in these times proclaim that someday soon Aroden will ascend to the heavens, but also not to fear, for he will return to the mortal world to usher in a golden age of peace and prosperity for all mankind.

As the seers predict, in fact, before the end of the fourth century, Aroden removes himself from the mundane affairs of [[Absalom]] and of the world of [[Golarion]], and shifts his focus instead to his growing divine domain in the [[Heaven|heavens]].

Although not all of humanity begins to worship Aroden at this point, so much of it does so that it could be considered the ubiquitous faith across most human civilization in the Inner Sea region.
Most notably, the Empire of [[Taldor]] adopts worship of Aroden as the official imperial religion, and with their zealous belief in the promised destiny of a unified future for humanity, Taldor expands rapidly in this period.
By the year 500, Taldor spreads so far north that it wraps around [[Lake Encarthan]] and reaches the Orc lands of [[Hold of Belkzen|Belkzen]].

### Taldan Empire

#### Tar-Baphon

This region will be the source of much conflict in the years to come, not just because of warring with the neighboring Orcs, but also due to the emergence of a powerful wizard king in the region, named [[Tar-Baphon]].
[[Tar-Baphon]] comes into power in the area around [[Lake Encarthan]] in the year 861, with his first conquest being the Isle of Inteper, later named the Isle of Terror, at the center of [[Lake Encarthan]]. Here, [[Tar-Baphon]] unlocks necromantic secrets and ancient power from the remains of one of the [[Runelords]] of ancient Thassilon.

![[tar-baphon_fullbody.png|500]]

With an army of raised undead and recruited Orcs from [[Hold of Belkzen|Belkzen]], [[Tar-Baphon]] begins to conquer Taldor lands.
Such was [[Tar-Baphon]]'s power that it attracted the attention of the god-king himself, and [[Aroden]] slew the wizard king on the [[Isle of Terror]] in a mighty battle in 896.

After the death of [[Tar-Baphon]], although [[Tar-Baphon]]'s conquered lands of Ustalav would remain independent, apart from this, Taldor would continue to expand its territory, stretching as far west as the Arcadian Ocean and as far north and east as Iobaria.

#### Taldor Expansion 


By [[1532 AR]], the [[Keleshite (human ethnicity)|Keleshite]] Empire of [[Qadira]] had also begun expanding, spreading westwards and conquering the ancient lands of [[Osirion]].

In the early 2000s, Taldor makes several attempts to spread south into [[Garund]] via the [[Hespereth Strait]].
These southern crusades largely prove unsuccessful, although they do have a lingering legacy.
The collision of Aroden-worshipping Taldans and [[Sarenrae]]-worshipping [[Thuvia|Thuvians]] and Qadiran have a lasting impact on the region, eventually encouraging the founding of [[Rahadoum]] in northwestern [[Garund]] in [[2555 AR]], a nation in which no gods may be openly worshipped.

Finally, in [[2632 AR]], almost 8000 years since the Elves left Golarion during the Age of Darkness, the Elves return to their kingdom in [[Kyonin]], reclaiming those forests and returning to the world.

The Elves that return also learn that some Elves had remained in Golarion, and they call these Elves the [[Forlorn]].
After being separated from their kinsfolk for thousands of years, the returning Elves find these Forlorn to be socially and culturally quite removed from the rest of their kind.
They never fully reintegrate, even to this day.

Taldan expansion continues throughout this period, and by the year 3000, the Taldan Empire occupies all of modern-day [[Andoran]] and [[Cheliax]].
Almost a third of Avistan is now a part of the Taldan Empire, their hegemony is almost supreme, bordered by [[Numeria]] and [[Ustalav]] in the northeast, and by the [[Zon-Kuthon]] worshipping nightmare nation of [[Nidal]] in the northwest.

#### Tar-Baphon Lich

Then in 3203, tragedy, [[Tar-Baphon]] returns to the world, somehow resurrecting himself as a lich and retaking [[Hold of Belkzen|Belzken]] and half of [[Ustalav]].
This marks the beginning of an almost millennia-long conflict with a lich tyrant.
By the time of [[Tar-Baphon]]'s return, Aroden himself is almost completely removed from the affairs of mortals, and although he does eventually get involved almost 500 years into the conflict, he does so by delegating the intervention to his herald, the demigoddess [[Arazni]].

She is ultimately humiliated and slain by the tyrant in 3823, who, in an effort to demoralize his opponents, throws her broken body back to her knights during the [[Battle of Three Sorrows]].
Despite [[Arazni]]'s death, Taldor continues to fight.

An order of paladins dedicated to the worship of Aroden name a skillful young knight named [[Iomedae]] to lead their ranks.
She and a Taldan general named Arnasant are able to fight the tyrant using a pair of artifacts called the [[Shattered Shield of Arnisant|Shield of Aroden]] and Iomedae's sacred sword, the [[Heart's Edge]].

![[iomede_fight.png|1000]]

Although they aren't able to completely destroy the lich, they are able to bind it beneath the [[Hungry Mountains]] in the depths below his old fortress of [[Gallowspire]].
A year later, in [[3828 AR]], the nation of [[Lastwall]] is formed to maintain a constant vigil against the possible return of the whispering tyrant.

Four years after this, [[Iomedae]] ascends to godhood herself, and she becomes the new Herald of Aroden, replacing the fallen goddess, [[Arazni]].
In [[3890 AR]], in eastern [[Garund]], [[Arazni]] is eventually resurrected as a [[Lich]] queen and ruler of the nation of Geb, which has been at war with its neighboring nation Nex for thousands of years.

#### Qadira

Things look quiet for a short while, but in [[4079 AR]], tensions flare up again between [[Qadira]] and [[Taldor]], and open war erupts along that southern border once again.
Forces from all across the empire are pulled into the war effort, and this creates a political divide between the more distant parts of the empire and those closer to Epara and the traditional Taldan lands.

A few years into this new war with [[Qadira]], with southern attention being diverted towards fighting the enemy, the empire of [[Taldor]] splits in half,.
The traditional Taldan lands remain [[Taldor]], but north and west of the [[Five Kings Mountains]], the remaining lands become the empire of [[Cheliax]].

### Chellish Empire

Effectively, this becomes the successor state to the larger portion of the old Taldan Empire.
[[Cheliax]], no longer needing to fund Taldor's long-standing war with its southern rival, focuses instead on expansion and conquest northward.
They call this the [[Everwar]] Expansion, and it begins in [[4305 AR]] with the invasion of [[Nidal]], and it ends about a hundred years later with the completed conquest of [[Korvosa]] and modern-day [[Molthune]] and [[Nirmathas]].

Cheliax also establishes colonies in [[Garund]], including the conquest of the [[Shackles]] and the colony of [[Sargava]].
At this point, it rivals the scale and power of the old Taldan Empire at its height.
The influence of the rest of Taldor wanes as it continues to expand all its resources on its ongoing war with Qadira.

Meanwhile, in [[4576 AR]], the city of [[Westcrown]] in the heart of Cheliax, a man named [[Daidian Ruel]], forms a vigilante posse to capture and kill members of a demonic cult responsible for a series of murders called the [[White Plague]] Murders.
This group of vigilantes become known as the [[Order of the Gate]], and they are the first order of [[Hellknights]], who turn to following the guidance of the dark god [[Asmodeus]], and reject worship of Aroden.

Crucially, for those of you that already know some of this history, this occurred thirty years before the death of the prophecy and the Chelish Civil War.
The Hellknight Order predates the Asmodean ascendancy and the ascendancy of [[House Thrune]].
*I highlight this because it's an overlooked detail in the history*, and although they owe fealty to the same god as [[House Thrune]], they have a very different lineage and heritage, and they don't always see eye to eye with them.

All this brings us to the fateful date, [[4606 AR]], roughly a hundred years before current day.

This is the day that prophecy dies.

The [[Starfall Doctrine]], the most important prophecy in the Arodenite faith, marked [[4606 AR]] to be the day that [[Aroden]] would return to the mortal world, and usher in the promised [[Age of Glory]].
Not only did the god not appear, but the very power of prophecy, which had defined Aroden's life and spurred his personal accomplishments and ambitions, stopped functioning.

At this appointed hour, Golarion was wracked with three weeks of storms and earthquakes.
- In western [[Garund]], a terrible maelstrom called the [[Eye of Abendego]] opened up, where it remains in perpetuity today.
- In the north, a terrible rent in the fabric of real space opened up called the [[Worldwound]], and from it, legions of demons spilled forth and raided the land around them.

When the cataclysms finally began to subside, the clerics of Aroden found they could not reach their god.
With his divine mandate removed, and the promise of a united humanity proven untrue, the Empire of Cheliax fell into both a religious and civil war.

## Age of Lost Omens

From [[4606 AR]] to the current year of [[4723 AR]], we call this period the [[Age of Lost Omens]].
This is the current age of the world.

The Chellish Civil War lasts for 34 years, from [[4606 AR]] to [[4740 AR]].
The Chellish Civil War is one of the defining features of the modern age.

The war is won by the [[House Thrune]], an ancient Chellish noble house, with lineage that can be traced back to Old Taldor, who practiced diabolism and worshipped the infernal god [[Asmodeus]].
In order to win the war, they required the support of the old rulers of [[Nidal]], offering to return them to power and return their nation to independence for their support.

Though Thrun won, they lost the territories of [[Isger]], [[Nidal]], [[Molthune]], near Mathis, and the greater [[Korvosa|Korvosan]] holdings in the north.
Despite those significant losses of territory, Thrunish control of Cheliax became brutal and absolute, outlawing specifically the worship of [[Iomedae]], who in Aroden's absence inherited much of Aroden's form of worship, so much so that this goddess is still called the Inheritor today.

The more oppressive [[House Thrune]] becomes, however, the harder it is  to control their outlying territories, and the more that resistance starts to galvanize against them.
The Empire of Cheliax begins to lose territory, starting with the nation of [[Galt]] in the furthest reaches of the empire in [[4667 AR]], this is followed by [[Andoran]] in [[4669 AR]], and finally the [[Shackles]] become an independent nation-state of pirates, ruled over by a pirate king in [[4674 AR]].

From [[4674 AR]] to [[4723 AR]], the last fifty years to present day, there are some other minor shifts in borders and nations, but broadly the [[Inner Sea region]] starts to settle into this new reality.
The great promised empire of mankind is not only a shadow of its former self, but it remains a cruel and imperialist nation, now even more so that its leaders openly worship one of the Lords of Hell.

The future is unknown and uncertain, and while there are a great many threats to peace and progress, there's also a lot of hope and potential.

The death of prophecy is a scary time for many, but it can also be a boon.
For the first time, the free people of Golarion can take stock and ask themselves, what kind of people do we wish to be? What kind of nations do we seek to build?
