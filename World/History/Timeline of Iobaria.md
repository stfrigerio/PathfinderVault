[['67 AR]]
The Native Plaguestrife: Various druid sects, guilds, and politicians fan flames against those they deem "non-native Iobarians" by claiming no plagues ever happened until folk started coming east from Avistan. Skirmishes and vendettas weaken the power bases of many for decades.


[[2920 AR]]
Earthquake rocks Taldor, Qadira, and central Casmaron. Coastal settlements along the northwestern Castrovin all damaged or destroyed by tidal waves.


3000s
Exodus. At least three separate waves of refugees abandon Iobaria over this century to settle other colonial lands to the west and south (mostly Issia and Mendev) or new domains east of the Castrovin Sea.


[[3150 AR]]
The Pestilentropy infected many nomads and settlers in central Iobaria, causing fevers and madness ultimately leading to death by overexertion or by the blades of those its victims imagine to be their foes. The disease or its manic side effects destroy more than half of Iobaria's farms, villages, crops, and cattle, leading to a decade of lean harvests and starvation for the region. This devastation and the lack of support for the people leads to the final dissolution of Old Iobarian rule.


Late 3100s
Following the fall of Old Iobaria, the barbarian warlord [[Kostchtchie]] claims the northeastern [[Dvezda Marches]] as his personal kingdom. He seeks out [[Baba Yaga]], demanding she grant him immortality. She does so, at the cost of stealing part of his soul and transforming him into a deformed giant. In shame, Kostchtchie flees to the [[Abyss]] and supplants [[Sithhud]] as the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of frost. Baba Yaga constructs the great monument of [[Artrosa]] to keep watch over Kostchtchie's former domain.


[[3212 AR]]
Three warlords (one of Issian descent) and their allies band together to restore the nation of Iobaria. Rallying to banners and flags of [[Old Iobaria]], support for [[New Iobaria]] rose quickly with their reclamation of Orlov from foreign factions and their local pawns. The Restoration War lasts for nearly a century before New Iobaria officially exists and rules its lands.


[[3283 AR]]
House Arjal and House Korya betray allied House Narkys, sacrificing its leaders and troops to dragons of the mountains and wilds, their newer allies.


[[3304 AR]]

[[3312 AR]] - [[3679 AR]]
This era is generally regarded as the height of New Iobaria. The city of [[Antoll]] is capital during this period.


[[3679 AR|3679 AR]]
The Great Horde. The cyclops Burlor retrieves the Crown of Mirim and the Perobov Maul from [[Dirrinir]]. With these artifacts he gathers a collection of ogre, giant, and cyclops tribes, and rampages across Iobaria. Siege, and burning, of Fralros. These monsters remain a threat long after the death of Burlor beneath the hooves of more than 25 tribes of [[Centaurs|centaurs]].


[[3870 AR]]
The human rulers turn to treachery, leading to strife and the eventual rising of a single faction (really, clan) to dominate Iobaria, forcing many enemies and former allies to flee west into Brevoy. New Iobaria will last 800 more years.


[[4000 AR|4000 AR]]
Amid the blizzards of a long and particularly harsh winter, [[Frost giants|frost giants]] from the [[Ice Steppes]] invade [[New Iobaria]], pillaging and murdering. They reach [[Orlov]] before being repelled.

[[4519 AR|4519 AR]]
The [[Drakeplague]] kills more than 60% of the dragon population within 3 months. Dragons enter Mavradia seeking a cure, and fight amongst themselves, ruining a third of the city. The silver dragon Cithaythren and [[Finadar Forest|Finadar]] druids perform a ritual to end the plague before it spreads beyond Iobaria, at the cost of that dragon's life. This disaster is commonly credited with weakening New Iobaria until its end in the early 4600s.


[[4606 AR]]
Death of Aroden. [[Worldwound]] opens.


[[4606 AR]] - [[4622 AR]]
[[Sarkoria|Sarkorian]] barbarians flee the expanding Worldwound. Many native Mendevians of [[Iobarian human ethnicity|Iobarian]] and [[Issia|Issian]] ancestry flee before them back to Iobaria. A number of Sarkorian tribes cross the polar ice to Iobaria.


[[4607 AR|4607 AR]]
Skirmishes and battles among Sarkorian refugees, native insurgents, and Iobarian troops begin the second fall of Iobaria with the loss of [[Mavradia]] to rebel forces.


[[4607 AR]] - [[4659 AR]]

[[4659 AR|4659 AR]]
New Iobaria reduced to the now-isolated cities of [[Kridorn]], [[Mirnbay]], and [[Orlov]], each of whose rulers now claims to be the true ruler and heir of Iobaria due to blood ties to the dead kings.


[[4667 AR|4667 AR]]
[[Red Revolution]] of [[Galt]]; many Galtan nobles flee north and eventually arrive in [[Kridorn]].
