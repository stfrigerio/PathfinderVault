> The year of [[3721 AR]] is known as the **Year of the Rent Sails**. The [[Andoran|Andoren]] Free Sailors group, had become a major threat for the [[Slavery|slavers]] in the [[Inner Sea]] when [[Lash-Handed Neguli]], captain of the [[Ship|galley]] *[[Hundred Oars]]*, rallied his fellow slavers and directed vicious attacks against the Andoren sailors. In the Year of Rent Sails, the slavers hit hard trade ships, warships and even [[Pirate|pirate]] ships that entered [[Okeno|Okenos]] harbor but refused to ally with Neguli. Overland raids increased as well. When the year was over a strong solidified group, called the [[Okeno Slavers]] had been formed.
