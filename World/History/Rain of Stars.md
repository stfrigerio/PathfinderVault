> The **Rain of Stars** was an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] event that occurred during the [[Age of Darkness]] in the land now known as [[Numeria]].



## History

> In [[-4363 AR]] a gigantic metal [[Spaceship|vessel from outer space]] on a collision course with [[Golarion]] broke apart in the atmosphere, creating a [[Meteorite|meteor-like]] shower that spread across the land. Chunks of the vessel fell to the earth across Numeria, some the size of fists and others as large as cities. The largest piece impacted in the central plains and is now known as [[Silver Mount]], while the next best-known site is called [[Scrapwall]], located near the [[Sellen River]] in eastern Numeria.


## Ship's construction and origin

***Main article: [[Divinity]]***
> The [[Divinity|ship]] is composed to a large degree of [[Skymetal|skymetals]], which were previously unknown to Golarion. The [[Technology|technology]] found in the Silver Mount and other crash sites is beyond that of any of the existing races of Golarion's [[Solar system|solar system]]. This means that the ship came from an [[Androffa|alien culture]] in deep space, or another time or [[Dimension|dimension]].


## Effects on Numeria

> Many of the events following the Rain of Stars have had lasting negative effects on Numeria. Thousands of years after its impact, the ship's [[Radioactivity|radioactivity]] continues to mutate, stunt, or kill the region's flora and fauna.
> The local [[Kellid]] population explored many of the crash sites soon after the Rain of Stars, a practice that changed soon after an unknown tribal chieftain in the [[Felldales]] triggered a catastrophic explosion in [[-3116 AR]]. The blast destroyed his tribe, sent a mushroom cloud and shaft of light into the sky, and poisoned the region for miles. Now fearful of the technological items, most Kellids subsequently buried or destroyed any new discoveries.
