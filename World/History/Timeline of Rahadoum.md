## Age of Anguish

> - [[-4120 AR]] Founding of the [[Jistka Imperium]]
> - [[-3500 AR]] The Imperium is at its height; its influence is felt throughout northern [[Garund]] and even in parts of what will become modern day [[Cheliax]] 

## Age of Destiny

> - [[-3300 AR]] The Imperium is weakened by betrayal and external raids
> - [[-'64 AR]] The Imperium collapses; its lands will be at least partly incorporated into ancient [[Osirion]], then at the height of its powers
> - [[-2587 AR]] Pharaoh [[An-Hepsu II]] founds the port city of [[Totra]] in [[Osirion]]. The fleets of the An dynasty will eventually sail from here in what is known as the Great Atoqua â€“ the subjugation of large parts of [[Thuvia]] and [[Rahadoum]] 
> - [[-1431 AR]] The rule of the Four [[Pharaohs of Ascension]] comes to an end, and [[Osirion]] enters into a decline; eventually Rahadoum will free itself of Osirion influence and become a region of isolated city-states

## Age of Enthronement

> - [[2498 AR]] Start of the [[Oath Wars]], a conflict between clerics of [[Nethys]], [[Norgorber]] and [[Sarenrae]]
> - [[2555 AR]] All clerics are expelled from [[Azir]]; the [[Laws of Mortality]] are enacted in the city
> - [[2560 AR]] The Laws of Mortality are enacted throughout [[Rahadoum]], ending the [[Oath Wars]]; the [[Red Mantis]] emigrate from Rahadoum to [[Mediogalti Island]] 
> - [[4305 AR]] [[Cheliax]] enters the phase of expansion that comes to be known as the [[Everwar]]. An expeditionary force sent into [[Rahadoum]] gains control of the province of [[Kharijite]], giving Cheliax control of both ends of the [[Arch of Aroden]], which it has maintained to the modern day.
