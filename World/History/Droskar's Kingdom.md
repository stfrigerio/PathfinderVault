***Main article: [[History of the Five Kings Mountains]]***
> **Droskar's Kingdom** in [[Five Kings Mountains]] was founded by [[Ordrik Talhrik|Theocrat Ordrik Talhrik]] in [[4382 AR]]. During the Droskar's Kingdom era all [[Dwarf|dwarves]] had to work in [[Droskar|Droskars]] name. For nearly 100 years the dwarves of the Five Kings Mountains lost all every sense of art and beauty and their craftsmanship became merely adequate. Many dwarves fled to the other dwarf kingdoms, as well as settlements in [[Druma]] and the [[Mindspin Mountains]]. In the end priests could not maintain their hold on the other dwarves and Ordrik's theocracy crumbled in [[4466 AR]], with entire settlements abandoned.
