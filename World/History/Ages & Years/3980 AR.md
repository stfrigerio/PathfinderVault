## 3980 AR in conflicts

>  - A group of [[adventurers]] confronts and defeats the [[Human]] [[wizard]] Ilgreth and his enthralled [[dragons]], in part by magically dispelling the domination from the *orb of golden dragonkind*. The [[Gold dragon]] [[Mengkare]] destroys the *orb*, which sets off the volcano's eruption, and escapes with the *orb's* shards back to [[Hermea]].


## 3980 AR in environment

>  - Touched off by powerful earthquakes, the volcano then known as Torag's Crag erupts in northern [[Andoran]] in an event known to history as the [[Rending]].
[[Darkmoon Vale]] is hit particularly hard, and parts of [[Almas]] are destroyed by massive flooding.
The quake also creates rifts in the nearby [[Candlestone Caverns]], allowing access by the inhabitants of the [[Court of Ether]] in [[Nar-Voth]] to the surface for the first time.
The destroyed volcano is renamed "Droskar's Crag".
