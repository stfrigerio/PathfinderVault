## 4338 AR in conflicts

>  - As the [[Everwar]] rages on, [[Cheliax]] finally gains full control over [[Nidal]] through diplomacy when the [[Black Triune]] surrenders, much to the chagrin of the [[Umbral Court]] and the other worshipers of [[Zon-Kuthon]]. The alliance between the two nations lasts until the present day, although since the end of the [[Chelish Civil War]], Nidal has once again assumed full control of its own populace.


## 4338 AR in politics

>  - The Nidalese surrender ushers in a period of relative cultural openness in that country known as the Shadowbreak. It will last until [[4634 AR]].
