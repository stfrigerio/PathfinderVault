## 3841 AR in politics

>  - Grand Prince [[Adavarine II]] of [[Taldor]] signs the [[Treaty of the Wildwood]], giving the druids of the [[Wildwood Lodge]] living within the [[Verduran Forest]] greater autonomy. In exchange, Taldor is guaranteed that it will be allowed to harvest enough lumber to support its shipyards without interference by the [[Fey]] and other protectors of the forest.
>  - High King Nkobe of the [[Mbe'ke]] [[dwarves]], last of his ancient ruling house, loses his only son to illness. His mind deteriorates into maddness and paranoia, sparking a civil conflict known as the War of Split Hearts.
