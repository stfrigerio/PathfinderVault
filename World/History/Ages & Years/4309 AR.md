## 4309 AR in deities

>  - The [[Lawgiver]], [[Herald]] of [[Abadar]], appears in [[Sable Barrow]] near [[Chesed]]. It appeared the night before a [[slave]] revolt was about to happen, and seemed to indicate that the [[god]] would smite the city if its citizens did not reform. After the slave revolt did not occur, the golden herald disappeared.


## 4309 AR in organizations

>  - The [[Pathfinder Society]] reaches 150 [[Pathfinder]] agents and 18 [[venture-captains]], and members agree to recruit two additional members before the organization's next meeting.
