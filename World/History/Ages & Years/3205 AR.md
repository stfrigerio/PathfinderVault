## 3205 AR in conflicts

>  - The country of [[Ustalav]] is besieged by the undead forces of the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]]. They are opposed by Ustalav's armies, and supported by the local church of [[Pharasma]] led by bishop [[Prince Adamondais Virholt]] wielding the holy mace *[[Raven's Head]]*. Sadly, they stand no chance against the undead archmage's powerful magic, and are destroyed.
>  - With the death of Prince Adamondais, the county of [[Virholt]] is left without a ruler. The bastard [[Prince Andriadus Virholt]] is appointed by the crown, but refuses to oppenly oppose the Whispering Tyrant's forces. Instead, he secretly joins with [[lycanthropic]] [[Sczarni]] to fight a guerilla-style war against the lich.
