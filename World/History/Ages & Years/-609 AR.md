>  - The much feared and renowned [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings|Linnorm Kingdom]] of [[Saebjorn Arm-Fang]] has grown to include all lands north of the [[Rimeflow River]], and from [[Broken Bay]] in the west to [[Glacier Lake]] in the east. His son rules [[Kalsgard]] after killing a [[Linnorm]] of his own, but no single Linnorm King will ever match Saebjorn's power and lands.
