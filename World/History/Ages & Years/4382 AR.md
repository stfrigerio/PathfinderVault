## 4382 AR in conflicts

>  - The [[Forge War]] ends with [[Ordrik Talhrik]] emerging the victor. He declares himself Theocrat of the [[Five Kings Mountains]]. The dwarves are forced to serve the dark deity [[Droskar]] by working for work sake, resulting in a slow decline in the quality of dwarven workmanship.
