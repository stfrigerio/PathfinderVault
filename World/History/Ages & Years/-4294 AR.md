## -4294 AR in environment

>  - The cloud of fine dust created by [[Earthfall]] that caused the [[Age of Darkness]] finally begins to lift. The people of [[Golarion]]â€”except the population of [[Nidal]]â€”again see the full light of the [[Sun]] after its absence of nearly a thousand years. This heralds the [[Age of Anguish]] as primitive people struggle to build new empires and forget the horrors of the past millennia.


## Miscellaneous

>  - This year is chosen by historians to be the first year in the second historical age of Golarion, the Age of Anguish.
>  - This year is -1794 IC in the [[Imperial Calendar]] of [[Tian Xia]].
