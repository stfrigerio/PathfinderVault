## 3833 AR in deities

>  - The [[Pharasmin]] priestess [[Mother Kavapesta]] (also known as [[Sister Sorrow]]) begins preaching her darker form of Pharasma-worship on the [[Ustalavic]] shores of [[Lake Divirmis]]. Her teachings, which later become known as [[Pharasmin Penitence]], emphasize suffering and stoicism as great virtues for those wishing to be judged worthy by the goddess after death.
