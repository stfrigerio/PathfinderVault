## 3150 AR in environment

>  - The Pestilentropy infects many nomads and settlers in central [[Iobaria]], causing fevers and madness, ultimately leading to death by overexertion or by the blades of those its victims imagine to be their foes. The disease, or its manic side effects, destroy more than half of Iobaria's farms, villages, crops, and cattle, leading to a decade of lean harvests and starvation for the region. This devastation and the lack of support for the people leads to the final dissolution of Old Iobarian rule.
