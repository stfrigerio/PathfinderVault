> The **Age of Destiny** ([[-3470 AR]] â€“ [[1 AR]]) began with the founding of the [[Osirion|Osirian]] civilization and spanned three and a half millennia until [[Aroden]] raised the *[[Starstone]]* from the bottom of the [[Inner Sea]] and founded the great city of [[Absalom]], ushering in the [[Age of Enthronement]]. It was marked by the re-emergence of [[Human|human]] civilization after the barbarism of the [[Age of Darkness]] and the [[Age of Anguish]]. Other notable occurrences included the founding of the nations of [[Taldor]] and of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]].
