## 2767 AR in politics

>  - In what became known as the Native Plaguestrife, various [[Rules/Classes/Druid]] sects, guilds, and politicians fan flames against those they deem "non-native [[Iobarians]]", by claiming no plagues ever happened until folk started coming east from [[Avistan]]. Skirmishes and vendettas weaken Iobarian power bases of many for decades.
