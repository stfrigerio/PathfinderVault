## 2589 AR in environment

>  - In the Year of Scouring Winds, a sandstorm lasting 33 days destroys almost all plant life in the [[Golden City]]'s valley, kills hundreds, and nearly buries the city. Some survivors flee to [[Sarenrae's Bastion]], where priests proclaim the sandstorm a "judgment" against the city's evil populace.
