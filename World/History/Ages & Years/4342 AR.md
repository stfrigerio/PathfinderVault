>  - The [[Pathfinder]] [[Koriah Azmeren]] publishes his research on the [[Darklands]], summarizing decades of work and countless trips into its lightless depths, including a final 3-year long solo expedition. Even though his work brings him substantial fame and moderate wealth, he decides to never again step into so much as a basement, living out his life in the highest towers of [[Absalom]]'s tallest building.
