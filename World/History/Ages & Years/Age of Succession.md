*For the [[Absalom Reckoning]] analogue to the Age of Succession, see the [[Age of Lost Omens]].*
> The **Age of Succession** is the modern age of the [[Imperial Calendar]] of [[Tian Xia]], starting with the death of [[Aroden]] and fall of [[Lung Wa]] in [[4606 AR|7106 IC]].
> The age's name is derived from the [[Successor States]] that rose after the disintegration of Lung Wa, and is marked by the numerous conflicts between these states while they attempt to reunify the continent under a single banner.
