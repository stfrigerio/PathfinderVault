## 2133 AR in politics

>  - [[Taldor's]] [[Seventh Army of Exploration]] pacifies the [[Isgeri]] tribe of [[Kellids]] and creates the [[Protectorate of Isger]] to serve as a trade route between [[Druma]] and the [[Inner Sea]]. Taldor maintains control of this vital trade route until the [[Even-Tongued Conquest]] nearly two millennia later.
