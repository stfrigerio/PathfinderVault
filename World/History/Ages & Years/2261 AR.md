## 2261 AR in conflicts

>  - After long skirmishes with [[Kellid]] forces from the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], warriors from the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] expand their territories eastward to the [[Tusk Mountains]], and southward to the [[Kodar Mountains]]. The Linnorm Kingdom of [[Raemerrund]] is founded some time thereafter, and holds this territory until the [[Winter War]] of [[3313 AR]].
