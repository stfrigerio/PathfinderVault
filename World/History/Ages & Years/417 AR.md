## 417 AR in conflicts

>  - The [[Padishah Empire of Kelesh]] begins pushing into the 'unsettled' lands of modern day [[Karazh]]. Led by General Hasham Niar, they slaughter any [[Kara]] they encounter. In response, a young [[Sogys Taramai]] unites the Kara horse tribes and eventually succeeds in completely driving the Kelesh from the [[Grass Sea]].
