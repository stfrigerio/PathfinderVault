## 3445 AR in conflicts

>  - Incensed by [[Queen Morgannan's]] plans to destroy an enormous, holy oak in the [[Hoarwood]] to build her new regional capital, the [[Ulfen]] peasants of the forest rebel against her with the help of the local [[druids]]. Hundreds of the rebels are captured by the Queen's forces, their blood drained and used to water the holy tree, killing it in the process. Although the revolt (later called the [[Hoarwood Rebellion]]) ultimately fails, it gives rise to an underground, anti-government movement called the [[Heralds of Summer's Return]].
