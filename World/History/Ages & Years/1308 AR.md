## Miscellaneous

>  - The *Resplendent Phoenix*, an enormous [[junk]] from the far-away [[Yixing]] empire in [[Tian Xia]] docks in [[Absalom]]. While not the first contact between the [[Inner Sea region]] and the distant continent, the ship begins a short-lived interest in Tian Xia. Everything involving the ship or its crew is incorrectly referred to as "Yixi" at first, but scholars soon replace the term with "Tian Xia".
