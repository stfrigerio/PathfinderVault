## Deaths in 4360 AR

>  - The famous [[Pathfinder]] [[Durvin Gest]] disappears for the final time during an expedition to [[Garund]]. Rumors abound at this time that clues to his disappearance can be found in the fifth volume of the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]*. It is impossible to verify this, however, as the volume is pulled from circulation by the [[Decemvirate]] and all remaining copies are destroyed.
