## 4623 AR in politics

>  - [[Queen Elvanna]] of [[Irrisen]] grants the town of [[Trezira]] in the province of [[Bleakmarch]] a monopoly on keeping the [[Frozen Road]] free of ice all year round (a job known as "ice cleaving").


## Miscellaneous

>  - Men quarrying the [[Irespan]] for stone to build the [[Arvensoar]] in [[Magnimar]] break into a hollow chamber, releasing a horde of spider-like monstrosities known as [[Shriezyx]]. Only the actions of local heroes, an adventuring band called the Eyes of the Hawk, stop the city from being completely overwhelmed by the creatures. This event leads to the enactment of a law forbidding anyone from damaging the titanic [[Thassilonian]] ruin.
>  - [[Seldinin Choaz]], blademaster of the [[Order of the Pyre]], leads a contingent of four [[Hellknights]] to assist the [[First Mendevian Crusade]] in [[Arodus]] of this year. After claiming numerous victories, they are colloquially renamed the [[Order of the Godclaw]].
>  - Construction of the [[Bridge of the Gods]] is prematurely abandoned but it at least connects [[Alkenstar City]] to [[Dongun Hold]].
