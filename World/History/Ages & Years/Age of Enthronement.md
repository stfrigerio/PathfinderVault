*For a complete list of year articles within the Age of Enthronement, see [[CategoryAge of Enthronement]].*
> The **Age of Enthronement** began with the founding of [[Absalom]], and its inception is also the starting point for the [[Absalom Reckoning]] dating system. The Age of Enthronement spans the years from [[1 AR]] until [[4606 AR]] when [[Aroden]], the god of humanity, died.
> This age is characterised by the emergence of a number of gods who ascended to divinity through the [[Test of the Starstone]]. The mortals who survived the test and became gods were [[Aroden]] in [[1 AR]], [[Norgorber]] in [[1893 AR|1983]], [[Cayden Cailean]] in [['65 AR|'65]] and [[Iomedae]] in [[3832 AR|3832]]. The nations of [[Andoran]] and [[Cheliax]] were founded as expansion from the kingdom of [[Taldor]]. The [[Oath Wars]] raged across northwest [[Garund]] between [[2498 AR]] and [[2560 AR|2560]] as the churches of [[Nethys]], Norgorber and [[Sarenrae]] vied for dominance. [[The Whispering Tyrant]] arose in [[3203 AR]] invoking the [[Shining Crusade]] in [[3754 AR]] which burned for three quarters of a century and ended with the founding of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] to defend against the return of the [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] king. In [[4305 AR]] Cheliax began an extended period of expansion annexing lands in [[Molthune]] and [[Varisia]] which would become known as the [[Everwar]].
