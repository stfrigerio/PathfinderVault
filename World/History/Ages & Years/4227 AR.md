## 4227 AR in environment

>  - Miners working in the [[Vault of Silver and Ice]] in the western [[Irrisen]] province of [[Bleakmarch]] contract a deadly and contagious disease called [[Chillbane fever]]. Hundreds of mine workers die and although the mine is sealed to contain the infection, it spreads to the provincial capital of [[Algidheart]], devastating the city. [[Queen Velikas]] calls on a priestess of [[Desna]] from the [[Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] for aid, and she manages to get it under control. A milder version of the disease survives to this day.
