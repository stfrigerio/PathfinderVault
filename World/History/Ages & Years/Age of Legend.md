> **Age of Legend** is a general term used to refer to the "prehistoric" time before the destruction of the *[[Starstone]]* led to the [[Age of Darkness]] in [[-5293 AR]]. It is marked by the rise of the first [[Human|human]] civilization on the lost continent of [[Azlant]], the establishment of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] Empire on [[Avistan|Avistans]] mainland, the rise of the [[Dragon|dragon]] rulers in [[Tian Xia]], and the creation of the [[Cyclops|cyclops]] nation of [[Koloran]] on the continent of [[Casmaron]]. It was preceded by the unmeasured time of the [[Age of Serpents]], and ended when the *Starstone* brought on the collapse of the first human civilizations and the [[Age of Darkness]].


## Tian Xia

> In Tian Xia, it is thought that dragons ruled the land by divine mandate during this period (which is known as the [[Age of Dragons]] there), waiting for humans to assume their rightful place.


## Occurrences of note

> - In the waning years of the Age of Legend, Azlanti forces invaded eastern [[Arcadia]], leading to a lasting era of isolationism and distrust of outsiders among [[Arcadian human ethnicity|Arcadians]].
> - [[Elf|Elves]] settled the [[Fangwood]], where they coexisted peacefully with its [[Fey|fey]] inhabitants and became comfortable with the forest's many connections to the [[First World]].
> - The elf [[Candlaron]] created the [[Aiudara network|aiudara network]].
> - The planets [[Damiar]] and [[Iovo]] collide, destroying both worlds and creating the [[Asteroid|asteroid]] belt known as the [[Diaspora]]. The collision causes a flare bright enough to be seen from [[Golarion]] and is observed by the people of ancient Azlant.
