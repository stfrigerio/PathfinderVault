>  - During the [[Chelish Civil War]], the skull-clad [[Order of the Crux]] refused to disband after the revolution. Hunted down and destroyed by the [[Order of the Scourge]] in 4663 AR, the butchers were slaughtered and their fortress, [[Citadel Gheisteno]], was put to the torch.


## Deaths in 4663 AR

>  - The merchant-lords of the [[River Kingdoms]] town of [[Nystra]] burn the [[Taldan]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid]] Tharl Grimull's family to death when his daughter refuses the advances of one of their members.  Grimull begins planning his revenge, which comes to fruition the following year.


## 4663 AR in politics
