## 3889 AR in conflicts

>  - In an effort to reclaim the glory days of the [[Shining Crusade]] six decades before, [[Commander Claidius Barronmor]] of the [[Knights of Ozem]] sends a small group of his soldiers to [[Mechitar]], the capital of the undead nation of [[Geb's Rest]], in order to gauge its defenses. They are killed to the man and reanimated by [[Geb's Rest]], the ghostly ruler of that land as [[graveknights]]. Furious at the Knights of Ozem's audacity in attacking him, Geb sends them back to [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] on a mission  [[the following year]].
