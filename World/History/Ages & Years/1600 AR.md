## 1600 AR in conflicts

>  - Historians believe this is the year when the [[Duergar]] conquered the [[Sky Citadel]] of [[Jormurdun]], forcing the few surviving [[dwarves]] to flee. The last king of Jormurdun shatters a relic called the [[Sky Key]] into five pieces. He retains one part for himself and grants one each to his four heirs as a memory of Jormurdun and a symbol of hope for a future reunion and rebirth of the Sky Citadel.
