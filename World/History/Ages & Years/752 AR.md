## 752 AR in politics

>  - Following the southern edge of the [[Crown of the World]] eastward, twenty hearty [[Ulfen]] explorers land on the eastern shore of the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]].  The single longhouse they build there, in the hopes of surviving the long, northern winter, eventually grows into the first settlement of [[Iobaria]], [[Okormirr]].
