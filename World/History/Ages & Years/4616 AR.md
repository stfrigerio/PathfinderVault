## 4616 AR in politics

>  - In [[Gozran]] of this year, [[King Gaspodar]] of [[Cheliax]] mandates the creation of several new orders of [[Hellknights]] without consulting existing [[lictors]]; they include the [[Order of the Scar]] and the [[Order of the Coil]]. These orders operate largely outside of Cheliax, and are not nearly as disciplined or well-organized as the original five orders.
