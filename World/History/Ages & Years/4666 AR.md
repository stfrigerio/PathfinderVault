## 4666 AR in politics

>  - The village of [[Sandpoint]] is founded along [[Varisia's]] [[Lost Coast]], a day's journey north of the city of [[Magnimar]].
>  - The [[Free Captains]] of the [[Shackles]] anger the [[Sargavan]] government (who pays them for protection from [[Cheliax]]). These transgressions are used by [[Baron Utilinus]] the [[following year]] to renegotiate the pirates' contract.
