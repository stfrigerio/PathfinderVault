>  - A [[Retriever]] under the command of the [[Glabrezu]] [[Mokravud]], a lieutenant of [[Treerazer]], breaks through the defenses of [[Imvrildara]] and destroys its Tower of Lust, the most dramatic damage done to the [[Fierani Forest]] temple of [[Calistria]] in its [[9,300 years]] of existence. The [[Imvrildarai's]] remaining Scions of Lust subsequently depart the temple.
