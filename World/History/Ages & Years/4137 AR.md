## 4137 AR in conflicts

>  - The [[Chelaxian]] army, under the command of [[Haliad I]], lays siege to [[Absalom]] for the first time. Like all before it, they fail to breach the city walls. Undeterred, the army heads southwest, making gains in [[Garund]], and takes control of the [[Arch of Aroden]].  This gives Cheliax unprecedented control over the [[Inner Sea region]], as it controls access to it from the west. Cheliax holds the Arch to this day.
