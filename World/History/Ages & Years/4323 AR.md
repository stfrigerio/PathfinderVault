## Miscellaneous

>  - The [[Pathfinder]] [[Durvin Gest]] explores and catalogs the 31 Siege Castles in the [[Cairnlands]] outside the gates of the city of [[Absalom]].  Thanks to this, the [[Pathfinder Society]] is able to draw enough funds from these ruins to help support their rapidly growing organization and expand their [[Grand Lodge]].
