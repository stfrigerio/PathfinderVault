## 3204 AR in conflicts

>  - [[Prince Ardurras II]] of [[Ustalav]], son of [[King Ardurras Virholt]] attacks the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] in an effort to save his homeland from the [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich]]'s forces. He is killed and his undead-destroying blade *[[Corpselight]]* is lost in the ensuing turmoil.
>  - [[Count Gildais]] is thrown into the [[Negative Energy Plane]] by the Whispering Tyrant as punishment for opposing him. He surprisingly returns soon thereafter as a [[Winterwight]].
