>  - Priests of [[Sarenrae]] in [[Qadira]] blame the recent earthquakes on [[Taldor]], claiming the nation had been cavorting with dark god to invoke the disaster. [[Qadiran]] [[Satrap]] Gheber II requests leave to declare war on [[Taldor]], but is refused by the [[Padishah Emperor]]. Tensions grow between both nations.
>  - In Taldor, some nobles proclaim that the disasters are proof that the Qadirans are in league with [[Rovagug]] and are threatening to release him from his prison.
