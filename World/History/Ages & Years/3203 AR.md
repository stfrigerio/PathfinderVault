## 3203 AR in conflicts

>  - The wizard [[Tar-Baphon]], killed by the god [[Aroden]] in [[896 AR]], returns as the [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich]] known as the Whispering Tyrant. Arising in [[Ustalav]], he rallies the [[orcs]] of the [[Hold of Belkzen]] and begins attacking central [[Avistan]]. Ustalav is the first to fall in the same year.
>  - The village of [[Rookmin]] is destroyed by the forces of the Whispering Tyrant. This site will later be chosen for the city of [[Vigil]], the capital of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]].
>  - The [[wizard]] [[Socorro]], a follower of the Whispering Tyrant, leads a revolt in the Ustalavic town of [[Carrion Hill]]; his followers massacre thousands.
>  - In the face of the Whispering Tyrant's invasion, the [[Accressiel court]] retreats into hiding in the [[Fangwood]], breaking their nearly 7,000-year-long alliance with nearby [[Kellid]] tribes and [[Human]] settlers.
