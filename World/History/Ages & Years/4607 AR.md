## 4607 AR in politics

>  - The great wyrm [[Gold dragon]] [[Aostralya]] calls a [[Convocation of Dragons]] to discuss the subject of the [[god]] Aroden's apparent death. All dragonkind sends representatives (except for the [[black dragons]]), but there is little agreement. No consensus is ever reached, with the chromatic dragons arguing that [[Human]] matters are below their concern. Unusually, however, the [[Red dragon]] [[Grathalax]] supports the pan-draconic goal of eventually destroying [[Dahak]].
>  - With the fall of the empire of [[Lung Wa]], the former province of [[Shenmen]] comes under the control of [[Lady Lang Loi]], a sadistic [[Bestiary/Jorogumo]]. Thus begins the kingdom's new reputation as "the [[cursed]] land of [[spiders]] and [[ghosts]]".
