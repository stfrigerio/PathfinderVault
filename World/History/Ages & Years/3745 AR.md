## Miscellaneous

>  - The *[[Necronomicon]]* is discovered (under its original name *Kitab Al-Azif*) by Byzantine scholar Theodorus Philetas and translated from Arabic to [[Greek]]. He hides a copy in the library of Ulthar in the [[Dreamlands]], before being forced to burn his translation on the steps of a church.
