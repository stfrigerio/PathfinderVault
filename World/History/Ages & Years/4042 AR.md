## 4042 AR in conflicts

>  - Afraid of the increasing military threat posed by the [[orcs]] of the [[Hold of Belkzen]], and unable to resist them in any other way, [[Count Andachi]] of the city of [[Tamrivena]] in [[Ustalav]] prays to the dark god [[Zon-Kuthon]] for aid. Later that year his prayers are answered in the form of the mercenary general [[Kazavon]].
