## 4288 AR in conflicts

>  - A massive hunt for [[vampires]] is begun in the [[Ustalavic]] city of [[Caliphas]], brought on by numerous, blatant attacks by the undead menaces. Hundreds of vampires are killed in the process, and their leader, [[Luvick Siervage]], calls on his brethren to adopt subtler methods.
