## Miscellaneous

>  - An enormous fire breaks out at [[Citadel Rivad]], headquarters of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] [[Hellknights]].  Its leader, [[Lictor Daidian Ruel]] is seen riding off toward the northwest, leaving behind [[Sheel Leroung]]'s top apprentice to die.  He is never seen again.
>  - With the disappearance of Ruel, [[Aligois Thels]], a brilliant naval tactician, is selected from among the only two dozen members to lead the Hellknights.
>  - Believing that the Hellknights will eventually replace the aristocracy-controlled military, Thels starts restructuring the order, breaking it into various ranks, and modeling it after the military of the ancient [[Jistka Imperium]].
