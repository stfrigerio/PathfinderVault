## Miscellaneous

>  - In response to an attack on his land by the [[Knights of Ozem]], the undead ruler [[Geb's Rest]] orders that the body of [[Arazni]] be stolen from her tomb in [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]]. He then adds insult to injury by reanimating her corpse as a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich]], naming her his Harlot Queen.
