## 4051 AR in conflicts

>  - [[Count Andachi]] of the [[Ustalavic]] town of [[Tamrivena]] leads an army against the cruel and despotic warlord [[Kazavon]]. Secretly a [[Blue dragon]] sent by the god [[Zon-Kuthon]] himself, Kazavon easily defeats his army and kills the count. He then orders the Ustalavic officers to be impaled on a massive thorn tree, where their screams echo out for days; a place now known as the [[Battle of Screaming Tree]].
