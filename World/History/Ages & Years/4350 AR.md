## Deaths in 4350 AR

>  - [[Kamilah]], an [[Osirion|Osirian]] [[arms merchant]] and [[slaver]], who was a concubine of [[Khalfani Zuberi]], dies in [[Varisia]] along with Zuberi's other concubines, [[Akila]] and [[Meskhenet]]. Their deaths were all due to a hidden power of the concubines' [[magic rings]] they had thought were purely designed to monitor their conditions.
