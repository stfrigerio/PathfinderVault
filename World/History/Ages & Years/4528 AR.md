## 4528 AR in politics

>  - In [[Taldor]], [[Grand Prince Stavian I]] outlaws the [[Cult of the Dawnflower]], and is able to convince the populace that Sarenrae's followers aided [[Qadira]]'s armies.  Within a few months, every Taldan temple of Sarenrae is destroyed and its faithful have been killed or driven out of the country.  This event is later christened the [[Great Purge]].
