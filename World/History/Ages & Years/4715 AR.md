## 4715 AR in politics

>  - [[Iomedaean]] [[knights]] of the [[Glorious Reclamation]] raid the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Godclaw]] to recover an [[Artifact]] of their [[goddess]]. The brazen attack sets off open rebellion against [[House Thrune]] in southern and eastern Cheliax, leading to the throne swiftly installing martial law in major Chelish cities.
>  - [[Paracount Barzillai Thrune]] is appointed lord-mayor of [[Kintargo]]. He immediately institutes a brutal crackdown on rebellious organizations, puts the city under a strict curfew, and begins issuing several sweeping proclamations over its citizens.
>  - After overthrowing the oppressive government of Sargava, the people of that nation rename it [[Vidrian]].


## Deaths in 4715 AR

>  - Benigno Ygresta, a professor and lecturer of [[necromancy]] at the [[Acadamae]], dies. He names his friend [[Varian Jeggare]] as executor of his will.
>  - The death and reanimation of Frell Tann in [[Korvosa]]'s [[Bridgefront]] district, as well as the discovery of dozens of corpses in [[Old Korvosa]], spawns an investigation into the city's increasingly harmful [[shiver]] trade.


## Miscellaneous

>  - [[Eando Kline]], Varian Jeggare, and their companions reunite the three volumes of the *[[Gluttonous Tome]]* under the influence of the [[runelord]] [[Zutha]]. Eando, along with Varian's companion [[Radovan Virholt]], free Jeggare from Zutha's thrall, and together they defeat the risen runelord before he can properly reconstruct his body. They later scattered the pieces of the *Gluttonous Tome* once again, but this brief return is enough for Zutha to re-establish a foothold in the world and for his influence to fester within all of the tome's fragments.
