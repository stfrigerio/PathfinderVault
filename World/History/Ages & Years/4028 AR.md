## 4028 AR in people

>  - The [[Ustalavic]] secret society known as the [[Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye]] removes its founder, [[Aldus Aldon Canter]], from the organization, supposedly due to his growing erratic behavior. He disappears mysteriously later that year after also having lost his title as a count and, probably, a large part of his sanity. The Order opens its membership to anyone willing to pay its exorbitant dues, bringing in many young nobles.
