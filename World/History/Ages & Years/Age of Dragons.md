> The **Age of Dragons** is a mythical time period of uncounted years used by the people of [[Tian Xia]] who follow the [[Imperial Calendar]]. People believe that during this time, the continents of [[Golarion]] were ruled by [[Dragon|dragons]] who had been appointed by the gods to act as stewards, until [[Human|humanity]] could take its rightful place. The age came to a close with the event known as [[Earthfall]], which ushered in the [[Age of Ashes]].
