## 2822 AR in conflicts

>  - [[Vudrani]] rajahs land on the island of [[Jalmeray]] and insist that as they are descendants of [[Khiben-Sald]], the isle belongs to them. They are rebuffed by the ruling [[Arclords of Nex]], whereupon the rajahs [[summon]] an army of [[marids]] from the sea. The [[genies]] sink all but one of the [[Nexian]] [[ships]], and Jalmeray once again becomes [[Vudran]].


## Miscellaneous

>  - At the age of 102, in the year **AD 28** on [[Earth]], [[Baba Yaga]] gains [[immortality]].
