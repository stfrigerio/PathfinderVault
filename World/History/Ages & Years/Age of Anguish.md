> The **Age of Anguish** is a term used by historians to describe the roughly 800 year period starting in [[-4294 AR]] when the skies finally cleared of the dust of [[Earthfall]]. This age was characterized by the conflicts of primitive peoples in a desperate struggle for survival and domination in a world left shattered by the [[Age of Darkness]]. The end of the Age of Anguish, and the beginning of the [[Age of Destiny]], was marked by the founding of the [[Osirion]] civilization in circa [[-3470 AR]], and the slow re-establishment of [[Human|human]] civilizations across the world.
