> The **Age of Serpents** is a term used primarily in the [[Inner Sea region]] by those who use the dating system known as [[Absalom Reckoning]] for the length of unmeasured time which preceded the rise of [[Human|humanity]] on the continent of [[Azlant]]. It was marked by the rise of one of [[Golarion|Golarions]] first [[Mortal|mortal]] race to gain control of large parts of the world and from whom the Age is named: the [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]]. Some scholars postulate that the rule of the serpentfolk in this Age stretched across continents and beyond to nearby [[Planet|planetoids]]. It was preceded by the mythical [[Age of Creation]] and was followed by the [[Age of Legend]], when the power of the serpentfolk was eclipsed by other races.
