## 4609 AR in conflicts

>  - [[Baron Grallus]], governor of newly sovereign [[Sargava]], pledges naval support for [[House Davian]] in the [[Chelish Civil War]]. Its ships depart for Cheliax but do not arrive until [[4610 AR]].


## 4609 AR in organizations

>  - In the month of [[Kuthona]], [[Lictor Aligois Thels]] reorganizes the [[Hellknights]] into separate orders, each capable of independent action. The five new orders are the [[Orders of the Chain]], [[Gate]], [[Pyre]], [[Scourge]] (which he commands), and Thorn.


## 4609 AR in politics

>  - The [[Kelesh|Keleshite]] sultan of [[Osirion]] is overthrown by the people of Osirion in a nearly bloodless coup. He is replaced by [[Prince Khemet I]], a [[Garundi (human ethnicity)|Garundi]] [[cleric]] of [[Abadar]] whose ancestry dates back to [[Azghaad]] and the [[pharaohs]] of Ancient Osirion, and so he becomes the first Osirian pharaoh in [[over 3,000 years]]. His accession ends the Keleshite Interregnum and initiates the Third Age of Osirion and inspires nostalgic nationalism and the rebuilding of pharonic monuments destroyed under Kelesh rule.
>  - Sargava breaks away from [[Cheliax]] and becomes a sovereign nation, the first Chelish territory to do so.


## Deaths in 4609 AR

>  - The [[Cheliax|Chelish]] Duke Kotaros is publicly killed by the [[Red Mantis]] assassins.


## Miscellaneous

>  - [[Sargavan]] merchants successfully bargain with the [[Free Captains]] of the [[Shackles]] to allow them safe passage and escort around the western edge of the [[Eye of Abendego]].
>  - The [[Sarkorian]] floating pleasure palace known as the House of Reflections sinks to the bottom of the First Rains. The accident occurs when its imprisoned guests launch an unsuccessful escape.
>  - [[Ulizmila]], supposedly the grandchild of the witch [[Baba Yaga]], journeys to [[Darkmoon Wood]].
>  - Several embittered captains from the navy of the recently fallen [[Imperial Lung Wa]] band together and begin construction on the floating [[pirate]] city of [[Zo Piaobo]] amongst the [[Wandering Isles of Minata]].
