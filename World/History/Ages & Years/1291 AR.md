>  - The [[Battle of Grasyhot]] ends with the victory of the [[Kellid]] forces of [[Queen Boliga Bharsolm]] over the [[Hill giant]] tribes of chief [[Urgo Axbiter]]. Queen Bharsolm is killed during the final confrontation, and a large burial mound is raised in her honor to forever mock the similar tomb of Chief Axbiter, who had died during a previous engagement.
