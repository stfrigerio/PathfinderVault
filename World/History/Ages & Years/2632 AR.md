>  - The elves, after an absence of almost 8,000 years, begin returning en masse to [[Golarion]] through the [[Sovyrian Stone]] located in the country of [[Kyonin]]. Their decision to leave the mystical land of [[Sovyrian]] is prompted by the demon Treerazer, who is attempting to corrupt the [[portal]] for his own ends.
Some of the elves that return find their old home was utterly destroyed and a strange tower had appeared, which they call the [[Mordant Spire]]. They rebuild and cut themselves of from the rest of the world.
