## 4622 AR in conflicts

>  - The [[First Mendevian Crusade]] is launched to quell the hordes of [[demons]] pouring from the [[Worldwound]] in [[Sarkoris]]. The crusade is launched by the faltering church of [[Aroden]] in an attempt to stir their worshipers into religious fervor. The actual leaders of the crusade are clergy in the rapidly rising church of [[Iomedae]]. They lead warriors up the [[Sellen River]] to the cold, demon-haunted lands of northern [[Avistan]].
Unfortunately, the religious fervour imbued into the crusaders had ill-effect in this year: some Crusaders mistook the [[druidic]] faith of the native Sarkorians as demon worship. In the ensuing witch hunt, over forty natives were executed at the hands of the holy warriors in this first year of the Crusade.
