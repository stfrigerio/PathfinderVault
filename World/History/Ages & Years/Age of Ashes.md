> The **Age of Ashes** is the earliest historical time period in the [[Imperial Calendar]] of [[Tian Xia]]. It begins with the impact of the [[Starstone]] (an event known as [[Earthfall]]), which, even though it occurred on the opposite side of [[Golarion]], still caused significant natural disasters in Tian Xia as well. 
> The age's name derives from the dust thrown up by the impact of the meteor, combined with large amounts of ash expelled by countless volcanoes, which blotted out the sun for many years and caused harsh winters all over the world. The Age of Ashes comes to a close with the rise of [[Human|humanity]] in Tian Xia and the founding of the empire of [[Yixing]] in [[-2499 AR|1 IC]].
