## 4402 AR in conflicts

>  - [[Imperial Cheliax]] attempts an invasion of the town of [[Halgrim]] in the [[Ironbound Islands]] of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]]. The attacks are quickly repelled by local inhabitants and the single Chelish ship of survivors is sent back with the pickled heads of their compatriots to serve as a lesson to the King.


## 4402 AR in politics

>  - A clan of [[assassins]] from distant [[Yenchabur]] in [[Casmaron]] arrives in the [[River Kingdoms]].  Led by His Supreme Highness Afanasy Athanasius, they easily invade the village of [[Rivermark]], forcing its residents to flee or submit to their rule.  It is subsequently renamed [[Daggermark]].


## Miscellaneous
