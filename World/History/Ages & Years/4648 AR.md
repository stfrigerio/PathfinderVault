## 4648 AR in conflicts

>  - The people of northern [[Molthune]] begin their violent rebellion. Though this begins as a few minor acts of sabotage in and around the lumber camps of the [[Fangwood]] forest, it soon blossoms into [[all-out war]] led by [[Irgal Nirmath]] that eventually leads to the rebels gaining their independence and forming [[Nirmathas]] in [[4655 AR]].
>  - Irgal Nirmath directs rebels to raze Sharpfang Camp, resulting in weeks of forest fires that killed 18 loggers and burned 3 square miles of forests to the ground.
>  - In retaliation for Sharpfang Camp, Molthune retakes [[Tamran]] for the third time in two years. They hold it for 6 months before an organized rebel force under Irgal Nirmath, now called [[Irgal's Axe]], retakes it.
>  - Molthune builds [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Forests/Fangwood]] on the ruins of a previous tower built by [[Tessarael]].


## 4648 AR in organizations

>  - The [[Harbingers of Fate]], an organization trying to bring about the promised [[Age of Glory]] by causing prophecies to come true, is founded in [[Absalom]] by Lord Garron after he finds the *[[Book of 1,000 Whispers]]*.
>  - Irgal Nirmath begins organizing settlers and rebels in northern Molthune, forming the core of what would become [[Irgal's Axe]].


## Miscellaneous

>  - The [[Ulfen]] warrior [[Aurnlagr the Fearless]] disappears in the [[Black Tarn]], clad in his [[Linnorm]]-scale [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor]] and wielding the [[sword]] *[[Rixbrand]]*.
