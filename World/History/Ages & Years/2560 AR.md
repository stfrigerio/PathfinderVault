## 2560 AR in conflicts

>  - The [[Oath Wars]], which raged across northwestern [[Garund]] for over sixty years finally come to an end as more and more cities adopt the [[Laws of Mortality]]. The city states that enact them ([[Azir]], [[Botosani]], and [[Manaket]]) eventually go on to form the nation of [[Rahadoum]].


## 2560 AR in politics

>  - The [[Red Mantis]] assassins flee Rahadoum and re-establish themselves on distant [[Mediogalti]]. Construction of the [[Crimson Citadel]] begins.
