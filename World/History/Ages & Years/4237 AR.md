## 4237 AR in conflicts

>  - [[Orcs]] of the [[Hold of Belkzen]] begin expanding their borders, pushing further south into the nation of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]]. Most humans flee in the face of the unstoppable horde save the [[Council of Thorns]] who remain and martyr themselves to protect what is now [[Ghostlight Marsh]].
>  - Orcs and Lastwall defenders clash at the [[Battle of the Burning Child]] and the Battle of the Bleeding Stones.
>  - Orcs retake their ancient capital of [[Urgir]], lost to them at the end of the [[Shining Crusade]] in [[3828 AR]].
>  - The nation of Lastwall constructs [[Harchist's Blockade]], south of the now overrun [[Sunwall]], in an attempt to stop the approaching orc horde.
>  - A small number of Lastwall soldiers make a last stand at Rake Island Bridge over the [[River Esk]] in the Hold of Belkzen against an overwhelming orc force. Their sacrifice inspires [[Iomedae]] to declare the site of the Battle of Lost Hope a holy shrine, and commands her followers to never let it fall into orc hands again.
