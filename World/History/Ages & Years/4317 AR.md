>  - The [[Pathfinder]] [[Durvin Gest]] investigates the ruins of [[Azlant]] far off the western coast of [[Avistan]] in the [[Arcadian Ocean]]. Tales of this journey are published in the first of the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]* in [[Absalom]]. Instantly popular, this volume brings explorers from all over the [[Inner Sea region]] to the [[Pathfinder Society]] with the hopes of having their own discoveries published.
