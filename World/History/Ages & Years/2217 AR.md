## 2217 AR in deities

>  - The religion of [[Sarenrae]], especially the [[Cult of the Dawnflower]], flourishes in foreign-controlled [[Osirion]].  The [[Qadiran]] satrap sees the cult as a threat and banishes them to the deserts of the west.
>  - Fleeing pogroms in Osirion instigated by the Qadiran satrap, followers of [[Sarenrae]] flee into the desert.  They are lead by a priestess named Vedie, who instructs them to build a settlement named [[Sarenrae's Bastion]]. Some disagree and leave to find a "golden land".
