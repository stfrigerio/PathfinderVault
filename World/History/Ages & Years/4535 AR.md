## 4535 AR in conflicts

>  - In the month of [[Rova]], Asar Vergas leads a mercenary force based from an ancient crypt on two months of sustained raids on [[Kassen's Hold]], a town founded by his former [[adventuring companion]] [[Ekat Kassen]].
>  - On 9 [[Neth]], townsfolk of Kassen's Hold end the siege by locating and attacking the camp in a battle that would leave many dead on both sides, including both Asar and later Ekat.


## Deaths in 4535 AR

>  - After a fierce battle, Asar Vergas dies on 9 Neth, and his mercenary army is driven away from [[Kassen's Hold]]. On 11 Neth, two days after Asar's death, [[Ekat Kassen]] also dies from a mortal wound sustained during the battle. Both are buried in the Crypt of the Everflame, which Asar had used as a base; Ekat was laid to rest in a place of honor, while Asar was relegated to a basic sarcophagus.
