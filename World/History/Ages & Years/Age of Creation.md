> The **Age of Creation** is a term used to describe the uncounted years of mythic time, beginning with the creation of [[Golarion]] and ending with the emergence of mortal races upon its face (the [[Age of Serpents]]). It was a time when the [[Deity|deities]] of Golarion played a much more active role than they do today. It was during the Age of Creation that the great battle that led to [[Rovagug]]'s imprisonment occurred.
