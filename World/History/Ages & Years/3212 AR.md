## 3212 AR in politics

>  - Three warlords (one of [[Issian]] descent) and their allies band together to restore the nation of [[Iobaria]]. Rallying to banners and flags of [[Old Iobaria]], support for [[New Iobaria]] rises quickly with their reclamation of [[Orlov]] from foreign factions and their local pawns. The Restoration War lasts for nearly a century before New Iobaria officially exists and rules its lands.
