## 4604 AR in politics

>  - The [[Cheliax|Chelish]] nobleman Quaid Robilad disappears during a visit to [[Katapesh's]] [[Nightstalls]]. Even though his wife offers a hefty reward for information about his whereabouts, Robilad is never heard from again. The incident nearly starts a war between the two countries.


## 4604 AR in environment

>  - [[The Torch]] subsides after almost [[two years]] of scorching the [[Numerian]] hilltop from which it ignited. Except for a few surges a year, the flame settles down into a bonfire with unusual properties that eventually leads to the foundation of a smithing village around it, called [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Torch]]. That fire stays continuously lit without fuel for more than a century until it mysteriously extinguishes in [[4714 AR]].


## Deaths in 4604 AR

>  - [[Prince Knoldaman Odranti]], ruler of [[Ustalav]], dies in the same year as his radical, anti-monarchist son [[Leiralt Odranti]], now known as 'The Lost Prince'.
