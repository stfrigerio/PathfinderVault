## 3449 AR in politics

>  - Construction is completed on the city of [[Hoarwood]] in [[Irrisen]]. [[Queen Morgannan]] installs her third daughter, Duchess Osillia Morgannan, to rule the provincial capital in an elaborate ceremony. This ceremony is interrupted by rebels from the [[Heralds of Summer's Return]], and Duchess Osillia loses her left eye in the fighting. In retaliation, Osillia orders that the left eye of every [[Ulfen]] resident of the province of [[Hoarwood]] be put out.
