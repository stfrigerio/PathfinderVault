## 4552 AR in politics

>  - The [[Gold dragon]] [[Mengkare]] grows weary of the pettiness of [[Human]] society and decides to found his own nation as a grand experiment. He wishes to see the limits of human potential when not bombarded by petty distractions, and founds [[Hermea]] on a tropical jungle island off the west coast of [[Avistan]]. He selects only the best and brightest that humanity has to offer and asks them to join him in his grand experiment. He begins this experiment by founding Hermea's only city, [[Promise]]. This is his second [[Glorious Endeavor]], after the failure of [[Breachill]], [[Isger]], in [[4520 AR]].
