## 4305 AR in conflicts

>  - Under the leadership of [[King Haliad III]], the [[Chelaxian Empire]] begins an extended period of expansion to the north. It starts by invading [[Molthune]]â€”although [[Varisia]] and [[Nidal]] (also attacked in 4305 AR) will eventually fall as wellâ€”in the conflict that becomes known as the [[Everwar]].
