## 4321 AR in organizations

>  - The [[Decemvirate]] is founded by a committee led by [[Toriah al-Myran]] to help manage the increasing complexity of the growing [[Pathfinder Society]], maintain the numerous far-flung [[Pathfinder lodges]], and facilitate communication between members. Its first members are 10 volunteer field agents recruited by al-Myran's committee and were drawn from the most scholarly and popular [[Pathfinders]] of the day.
