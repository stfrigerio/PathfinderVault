> The **Age of Darkness** was a thousand-year period in which the [[Sun|suns]] light was blocked by the ash knocked into the atmosphere by the meteoric impacts of [[Earthfall]]. It began with the impact of the [[Starstone]] in [[-5293 AR]] and lasted until the sun's light had been restored, roughly in [[-4294 AR]]. During the Age of Darkness, all major civilizations across [[Golarion]] were destroyed, ushering in a time of anarchy and destruction.



## Fall of empires

> The thousand-year darkness that blanketed Golarion destroyed the remnants of most of the existing civilizations that had risen during the [[Age of Legend]], including the [[Human|human]] empires of [[Azlant]] and [[Thassilon]], and the already fading [[Cyclops|cyclops]] culture of [[Ghol-Gan]].


## Emergence of races

> The [[Orc|orcs]] emerged *en masse* on the surface from their [[Darklands]] homes around [[-5102 AR]], fleeing the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] pressing up during their [[Quest for Sky]]. The darkness also beckoned to the [[Wayang|wayang]] from the [[Plane of Shadow]], who began immigrating to the continent of [[Tian Xia]] during this time.


## Return of Zon-Kuthon

> The god [[Abadar]] had banished [[Zon-Kuthon]] to the Plane of Shadow long ago, not wishing to destroy him completely, but had created a loophole: Zon-Kuthon's exile would last "as long as the sun hung in the sky". The dark god took the darkness on Golarion as the fulfillment of this agreement and returned from exile to wreak more misery on the world.
