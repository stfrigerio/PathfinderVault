## 4640 AR in politics

>  - After over 30 years of the [[Chelish Civil War]], the [[diabolical]] [[House of Thrune]] wrests control over the feuding noble houses of Cheliax. House Thrune's leader, [[Abrogail Thrune]], ascends to the throne of [[Cheliax]] as Abrogail I. [[Diabolism]] and the worship of [[Asmodeus]] are established as the official Chelish state religions.
>  - [[Anvengen Doskivari]], a priest of Asmodeus and close ally of the House of Thrune, assumes the position of mayor in the former [[Cheliax|Chelish]] capital of [[Westcrown]]. He is the first appointed mayor of the city since the death of [[Aroden]].
>  - [[Sargava]] secedes from [[Cheliax]]. In preparation for the inevitable retribution, [[Baron Grallus]] pays the [[Free Captains]] of the [[Shackles]] for protection.
