## 3044 AR in conflicts

>  - [[Baron Sirian First]] returns to [[Rostland]] a changed man. Answering to the name Sirian Aldori, the "Sword Baron" challenges the bandit lord who shamed and ousted him in [[3035 AR]] to a rematch and defeats him handily in seconds. He follows this with a standing offer of 100,000 [[gold pieces]] as a reward for any who can best him in a battle of blades.
