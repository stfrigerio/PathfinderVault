## 2332 AR in politics

>  - The [[dwarven]] kingdoms of the [[Five Kings Mountains]] put aside their differences and sign the [[Kerse Accord]] in [[Highhelm Militia]], ending the 700-year-long [[Five Kings Wars]]. [[Humans]] from the [[Kalistocracy of Druma]] are brought in to broker the treaty, and end up being granted access to the mountains' considerable mineral wealth.
