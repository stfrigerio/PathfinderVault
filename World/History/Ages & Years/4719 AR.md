## 4719 AR in conflicts

>  - The Cinderclaw cult activates [[Huntergate]] and invades [[Citadel Altaerein]] in [[Isger]]. This causes a band of heroes to get involved, culminating in the destruction of the Manifestation of [[Dahak]].
>  - [[Tar-Baphon]] breaks free from [[Gallowspire]], destroys [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] and turns it into the [[Gravelands]], and marches across [[Avistan]] to invade [[Absalom]] in order to claim the *[[Starstone]]*. He is ultimately defeated when a band of heroes tricks him into accidentally turning his [[weapon]] on himself, and is forced back to the [[Isle of Terror]].
The [[orcs]] of [[Belkzen]] rebuff the emissaries sent by Tar-Baphon, and successfully fight off his forces.

## 4719 AR in organizations

>  - The [[Pathfinder Society]] covertly reaches an agreement with [[Free Captain Stella Fane]] to allow its ships to pass through [[pirate]] blockades of [[Vidrian]].
>  - [[Eylysia]], a founding member of the Pathfinder Society, is exfiltrated by the Society from hiding on [[Red Mantis]]-controlled [[Mediogalti]].
>  - Pathfinder Society Seekers reveal a long-term plot to install [[Vahlo Huovar]], a [[Graveknight]] agent of Tar-Baphon, in the Decemvirate to manipulate the Society. He raises killed [[Pathfinders]] to serve him and attempts to seize the [[Grand Lodge]] in [[Absalom]], but is defeated, and his [[Decemvirate Helm]] is destroyed.
In the wake of these events, [[Eliza Petulengro]] becomes the first member to shed her [[Decemvirate Helm]] and anonymity since the Pathfinder Society leadership first adopted masks in [[4411 AR]]. Petulengro cedes her prior role as [[venture-captain]] of [[Woodsedge Lodge]] in [[Galt]] to [[Armeline Jirneau]].

>  - In the aftermath of Tar-Baphon's invasion of the [[Inner Sea region]], the Pathfinder Society takes a year-long census counting surviving lodges and agents, and the [[Decemvirate]] refocuses the organization on [[Archaeology]] and exploration. More than half of its membership is found to have perished in battle against the Whispering Tyrant.
During census operations at the [[Nexus House]] in [[Quantium]], [[Nex]], Pathfinders discover evidence of the Open Road Pact from unpublished reports by founding Pathfinder [[Kerinha Napsunar]]. This initiates a chain of events that leads to a confrontation with Qxal, the Thorned Monarch, and the founding of the Open Road Lodge in the [[following year]].

>  - Pathfinder Society [[Venture-Captain]] [[Calisro Benarry]] completes the final expedition to the [[Gloomspires]], located in the [[Arcadian Ocean]] west of the [[Eye of Abendego]].
The [[Decemvirate]] subsequently orders Benarry to relinquish control of the *[[Grinning Pixie]]* to [[Eras the Needle]], and pays her handsomely to do so. She purchases a new ship, the *[[Glorious Payoff]]*, with the income.
