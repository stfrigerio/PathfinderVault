>  - The warlord [[Voradni Voon]] is the first to unsuccessfully besiege the city of [[Absalom]] using an army of local [[centaurs]], an event now known as the [[First Siege of Absalom]].  The god [[Aroden]] himself commands a group of volunteers to defend [[Azlanti Keep]], a unit that eventually becomes the [[First Guard]].
