## 4606 AR in deities

>  - The ancient [[Starfall Doctrine]] predicts that the god Aroden will return to [[Westcrown]], become emperor of Cheliax, and lead [[Golarion]] into the [[Age of Glory]].

## 4606 AR in environment

>  - The death of Aroden is followed by tremendous storms across the face of Golarion.
At the very moment of Aroden's death, the most powerful hurricane the world has ever known forms off the western coast of [[Garund]]. It is known as the [[Eye of Abendego]] and has yet to die down.
The Eye of Abendego leads to massive storm surges which flood the low-lying land along the western coast of Garund, leading to the death of thousands. This destroys the nations of [[Lirgen]] and [[Yamasa]], creating the [[Sodden Lands]].
Within three days after Aroden's death, storms destroy [[Deng]], a town on the southern coast of Cheliax. The town is never rebuilt, and the spirits of its dead residents live on as [[ghosts]].
Storms devastate [[Hermea]] and disrupt the third generation of [[Mengkare's]] [[Glorious Endeavor]], leading the [[Gold dragon]] to delegate recruitment for his experiment to three trading groups.
Storms hammer the coast of [[Osirion]] in [[Garund]] and flood the [[Sphinx]], [[Asp]], and [[Crook]] rivers. The subsequent devastation leads to famine.

Massive earthquakes rock the plains south of [[Mzali]] and destroy five cities, thus creating the [[Shatterfield]].
Upon Aroden's death, five cities in the plains south of [[Mzali]] in [[Garund]] are destroyed by massive earthquakes. The land becomes known as the [[Shatterfield]] and remains prone to seismic activity.
