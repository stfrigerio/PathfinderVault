## 4577 AR in conflicts

>  - Misirnis Taranik, secret leader of the [[Wiscrani]] cult of [[Sifkesh]], is put to the flame along with the rest of the followers of the [[Path of Grace]].
>  - The [[Hellknights]], under the command of [[Daidian Ruel]], succeed in destroying the [[Path of Grace]]. Ruel himself lays the head of the false [[cleric]] Attromia at the feet of [[King Gaspodar]] of [[Cheliax]]. Delighted with their efforts, the king allows the Hellknights to restore [[Fort Rivad]] for use as a permanent base of operations and provides the group with funding.
