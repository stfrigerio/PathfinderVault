## 4644 AR in conflicts

>  - The city of [[Storasta]], the last remnant of the [[Kellid]] nation of [[Sarkoris]], falls to the [[demonic]] hordes from the [[Worldwound]]. Refugees from the settlement flee and overwhelm the small nearby settlement of [[Gundrun]], and then across the [[Ustalavic]] border, triggering the Demonskin War.


## 4644 AR in environment

>  - The Blood Summer of Korvosa.  The population of [[Reefclaw]] in the city explodes, with attacks by the creatures killing eight people.


## 4644 AR in people

>  - In the process of trying to become a [[Mechanics/Bestiary/Bestiary/Lich]], [[Vorel Foxglove]] is interrupted by his wife Kasanda, who destroys his [[Phylactery]].  His attempt fails, and the magical feedback causes him to break out in terrible boils and tumors, which quickly kill him.  The disease spreads to his wife, who passes it on to her children and servants; all die within minutes.  Vorel's spirit fuses with the house, and it becomes his new phylactery.


## 4644 AR in politics

>  - The citizens of the [[Varisian]] city of [[Korvosa]] hold a vote to change their lord [[Eodred Arabasti]]'s title to that of king, becoming King Eodred Arabasti I.
