>  - A [[Numerian]] chief explores the ruins of the fallen [[starship]] that will later be known as [[Silver Mount]], triggering a massive explosion that kills him and the rest of his tribe. This event is the origin for the local taboo against the use of [[Technology]]. The crater left by the explosion is today called Witchlight Vale.
