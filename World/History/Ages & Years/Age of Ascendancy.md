*For the [[Absalom Reckoning]] analogue to the Age of Ascendancy, start with the [[Age of Destiny]] from [[-2499 AR]], and continue through to the end of the [[Age of Enthronement]].*
> The **Age of Ascendancy** marks more than 7,000 years of civilization in the [[Imperial Calendar]] of [[Tian Xia]], starting with the establishment of [[Yixing]] in [[-2499 AR|1 IC]], the Imperial Calendar's epoch year.
> The age's name is derived from the rapid expansion of Yixing as a continent-spanning empire, and ends with [[Aroden|Arodens]] death in [[4606 AR|7106 IC]] and the disintegration of [[Lung Wa]] into the [[Successor States]], leading to the [[Age of Succession]].
