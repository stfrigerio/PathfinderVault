## 4665 AR in conflicts

>  - The [[Third Mendevian Crusade]] is launched. Instead of focusing on defeating the [[demons]] of the [[Worldwound]], the crusade's focus soon shifts to rooting out and eliminatingi believed or imagined traitors in [[Mendev]]. Hundreds of citizens are burned at the stake in nation-wide witch hunts, designed to root out subtle demonic influences. These attacks target local [[Kellids]] and those who hold [[Sarkorian]] animist beliefs in particular. These actions greatly hurt the reputation of the [[Church of Iomedae]].
