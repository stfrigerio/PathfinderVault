## 2497 AR in conflicts

>  - [[Gardadth]], the oldest [[dwarven]] nation within the [[Five Kings Mountains]], falls to the [[orcs]] with the exception of the capital city, [[Highhelm Militia]].
>  - The orcs fail to breech the inner fortifications of [[Highhelm Militia]] after five years of conflict, forcing them to abandon the siege.
>  - The [[Demon]] [[Treerazer]] finds the [[Sovyrian Stone]] in the [[elven]] capital of [[Kyonin]].

The [[Calistrian]] temple of [[Imvrildara]] begins its long focus on the battle to defeat Treerazer.
