## 4691 AR in conflicts

>  - A [[Taldan]] duke launches an attack on [[Andoran]] with the intention of taking back the "rebellious province." The eastern counties of Andoran are lain to waste before Andoran manages to gather her armies. The event coincides with the rise of the [[Eagle Knights]], leading to rumours that the organisation was somehow behind the conflict.
>  - The [[Lilitu]] [[Demon]] Minagho gains control over the ruins of [[Raliscrad]] in the Worldwound.


## Miscellaneous

>  - While exploring the Liquid Pyramid of the [[Naga Pharaoh]], [[Taldan]] explorers are struck by a horrible curse. In response, they eviscerate themselves and tie their entrails to an ankh symbol embedded in the ocean floor before resurfacing.
