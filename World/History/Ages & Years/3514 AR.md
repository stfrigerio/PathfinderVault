## 3514 AR in politics

>  - [[Queen Urvalane]] of [[Irrisen]] splits the province of [[Wintercrux]] in two, renaming the western half bordering the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] the [[Verge]]. She designates the former regional capital of [[Redtooth]] as the new capital of the Verge, and puts her second son, Kazimir Urvalane, in charge. The [[Ulfen]] town of [[Morozny]] is made the new capital of Wintercrux, leading to its subsequent growth.
