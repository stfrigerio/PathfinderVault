## 1551 AR in conflicts

>  - The [[dwarven]] empire of [[Tar Taargadth]], which had existed since the beginning of their people's [[Quest for Sky]] in the [[Age of Darkness]], comes under massive attack by [[Orc]] forces. Many of its [[Sky Citadels]] fall and the empire collapses. By the end of the disaster, only four of the [[Sky Citadels]] remain in Dwarven hands: [[Dongun Hold]] in [[Alkenstar]], [[Highhelm Militia]] in the [[Five Kings Mountains]], [[Janderhoff]] in [[Varisia]], and [[Kravenkus]] in the [[World's Edge Mountains]].
