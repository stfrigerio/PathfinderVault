>  - A [[paladin]] of the [[Order of the Holy Sentinels]] named Holton Albright nearly releases the [[Balor]] Goriath from the *[[Demonscope]]*. He is prevented from doing so by a band of adventurers, but as a result, Goriath is banished and the *Demonscope* loses its power.
>  - The [[Nagaji]] hero [[Zethivaxus Djeed]] leads an expedition into the [[Clicking Caverns]], disappearing without a trace. Nine months later, Zethivaxus re-emerges from the Caverns as a [[Clockwork]] abomination at the head of an army of haunted clockwork horrors that proceeds to ravage the countryside of western [[Xa Hoi]].
>  - [[Yargos Gill]] acquires a centuries-old codebook used by the [[Black Echelon]] to infiltrate and weaken [[Absalom]]'s defenses in preparation for the [[Silent Tide]]. He unwittingly sets into motion the operatives' plan, and the book is taken from him by [[Nessian]], leader of the War Hounders gang. He enlists the Pathfinder Society to help end the threat.
>  - [[Whitebridge Station]] is destroyed and its occupants massacred by [[Ekujae]] [[elves]].
