## 3937 AR in conflicts

>  - The descendants of [[Queen Harcatha]] of [[Irrisen]] (known as the [[Jadwiga]] Harcatha) rebel against the current queen, [[Sascha]], in the [[Harcatha Rebellion]]. This conflict is brought on by perceived indignities perpetrated by the descendants of Sascha (called the [[Jadwiga]] Sascha). The rebellion is quickly put down, and its survivors flee to the [[Witchcaves]] in the south of [[Hoarwood]] province.
