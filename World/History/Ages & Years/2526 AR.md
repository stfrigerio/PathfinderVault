## 2526 AR in conflicts

>  - [[Taggoret (city)|Taggoret]], the last of the [[Dwarf]] nations within the [[Five Kings Mountains]], falls to [[orcs]], effectively ending dwarven control of the mountains (aside from [[Highhelm Militia]]). The ensuing period of rout became known by the dwarves as the [[Wild Era]], and would continue until the rise of [[Tar Khadurrm]] over seven hundred years later.
