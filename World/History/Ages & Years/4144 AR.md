>  - Countess Robeskea of the [[Ustalavic]] county of [[Ulcazar]] has the [[Pharasmin]] [[monks]] of the [[Monastery of the Veil]] slaughtered to the last man in the name of the [[god]] [[Norgorber]], believing that they had not done enough to prevent the deaths of her children. She takes over the monastery and its ancient library and helps to establish an order of [[assassins]] calling themselves the [[Anaphexia]].
