## 4079 AR in politics

>  - The imperial vizier of [[Qadira]] departs for [[Kelesh]] to settle a family claim on the imperial succession, temporarily leaving the Qadiran [[Satrap]] Gheber III to his own devices.
>  - The [[Andoran]] Admiral Genise Ratorian begins offering Writs of Course to sailors in the city of [[Augustana]], and encourages them to attack [[Taldan]] merchant ships. This lays the groundwork for the future establishment of the [[Gray Corsairs]].


## 4079 AR in conflicts

>  - The armies of [[Qadira]], consisting of more than 40,000 [[Qadiran]] and [[Kelesh|Keleshite]] soldiers, invade southern [[Taldor]], beginning the 524 year-long war between the two countries known as the [[Grand Campaign]]. The Qadirans record the successes of this conflict as the [[Ghevran Victories]].
>  - The Taldan city of [[Zimar]] falls to [[Qadira]], its militaristic citizenry enslaved to prevent rebellion.
>  - The [[Jadwiga]] Harcatha (the descendants of [[Queen Harcatha]], the former ruler of [[Irrisen]]) emerge from the [[Witchcaves]] and in a fit of insanity, begin attacking the settlements of [[Hoarwood]]. [[Karina]], the current queen of Irrisen, sends her son, General Chernim Karina, to put down the crazed Jadwiga, and seals the Witchcaves.
