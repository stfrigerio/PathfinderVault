## -5293 AR in deities

>  - [[Zon-Kuthon]] returns to [[Golarion]] from his exile to the [[Shadow Plane]], emerging somewhere near modern-day [[Ridwan]] in [[Nidal]].
>  - The [[Dragon]] [[god]] [[Dahak]] enters [[Golarion]] through a gap in the [[aiudara network]] and begins a rampage in the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. In response, the [[Ekujae]] tribe of [[elves]] confine Dahak within the [[Huntergate]], leaving his manifestation trapped between [[planes]].


## -5293 AR in environment

>  - A giant meteorite, now referred to as the [[Starstone]], is called down from the heavens by [[alghollthus]] and destroys the continent of [[Azlant]]. The event becomes known as [[Earthfall]], reshapes the surface of Golarion, creates the [[Inner Sea]], and plunges the world into the [[Age of Darkness]].
>  - On the continent of [[Tian Xia]], the impact of the Starstone unleashes terrible tsunamis which reshape its coastline. The Chenlun Mountains, located at the antipode of Azlant, erupt with countless volcanoes that blot out the sun for years. The reptilian [[Valashai]] empire is devastated.
>  - The impact of the Starstone destroys the land bridge between the continents of [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]]. Water from the [[Arcadian Ocean]] begins to flow east and form the Inner Sea.


## Migrations in -5293 AR

>  - The majority of the [[elves]] of Golarion, having been forewarned of Earthfall by their diviners, flee to the world of [[Sovyrian]] using the [[Sovyrian Stone]] and escape the cataclysm. Some refuse to leave Golarion and descend into the [[Darklands]], or flee to the far north and south instead. Elves who settled the [[Fangwood]] flee to the [[First World]] but find that most of the paths back have closed.


## -5293 AR in politics

>  - The great empires of [[Azlant]] and [[Thassilon]] are destroyed by [[Earthfall]].
>  - The tribal leaders of what is now Nidal successfully petition the newly returned Zon-Kuthon for protection from the devastations of Earthfall. The leaders are transformed into the immortal [[Black Triune]] and the nation is forever bound to the Midnight Lord.


## Deaths in -5293 AR

>  - Trying to save Golarion from total destruction from Earthfall, the [[Azlanti]] [[goddess]] of the [[moon]] and battle, [[Acavna]] dies. Her corpse utterly destroys the elven base at what is now the [[Mordant Spire]].


## Miscellaneous

>  - This year is generally considered by historians to be the opening year of the first historical age of the [[Inner Sea region]], the Age of Darkness. Before it were the uncounted years of the [[Age of Legend]]. In Tian Xia, this years marks the beginning of the [[Age of Ashes]], which lasts nearly 2,800 years.
>  - This year is -2793 IC in the [[Imperial Calendar]] of Tian Xia.
>  - Many [[Kellid]] in what will later be known as [[Numeria]] perish during Earthfall, but enough survive in caves to rebuild their tribes in the following years.
