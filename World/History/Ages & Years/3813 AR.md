## 3813 AR in politics

>  - [[Harcatha]], daughter of [[Baba Yaga]], becomes the sixth queen of [[Irrisen]], taking over from her sister [[Aelena]], who does not resist. Aelena abdicated serenely, telling her children that they are joining their grandmother to travel the [[Great Beyond]]. This is the first time such a changeover occurs without any resistance from the previous office holder.
