## 4676 AR in politics

>  - [[Toriaka]], the man who would become the Sun Shogun of [[Shokuro]], is exiled from his homeland of [[Minkai]]. He sets out to seek the honourable [[elves]] of [[Jinin]] but becomes embroiled in the violence affecting northern [[Lingshen]] and the area now known as Shokuro.


## Miscellaneous

>  - The month of Rova brings the first of many nightly disappearances blamed on shadowy forces in the Chelish city of Westcrown. The [[mayor]] institutes a night-time curfew that is still in effect. The abductions are performed by shadowbeasts, and while [[Nidalese]] [[Shadowcallers]] under [[Ilnerik Sivanshin]] and the [[Midnight Guard]] are supposed to curtail their efforts, they are widely believed to encourage them.
