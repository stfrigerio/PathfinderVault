> **Devil's Night** was a violent riot that broke out in the [[Ascendant Court]] district of [[Absalom]] in the late 4690s AR.
> The religious riot began when displaced [[Cheliax|Chelaxian]] nobles attempted to burn down the Temple of [[Asmodeus]] and clashed with the guards. The riots were led by the [[Tiefling|tiefling]] militant Amata and her three accomplices. When the uprisings failed, these four conspirators were tried and sentenced to the [[Black Whale]] prison.
