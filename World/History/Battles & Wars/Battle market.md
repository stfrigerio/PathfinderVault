> Centuries ago, when the mysterious [[Pactmasters]] first came to [[Katapesh]], one method they used to calm the savage humanoids and barbarians of the nation's interior was the creation of numerous **battle markets** in small villages throughout the land. Each battle market was a multi-level bazaar, tavern and entertainment arena designed to keep traders safe from brigands and spread wealth to the common folk of heartland. One such battle market stood at the heart of the village of [[Kelmarane]] in the [[Brazen Peaks]].
