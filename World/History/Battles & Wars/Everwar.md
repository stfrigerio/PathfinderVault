> The **Everwar** (also known as the **Wars of Expansion**) was a century-long war of conquest launched by the [[Cheliax|Empire of Cheliax]] to increase its holdings. It was begun in [[4305 AR]] by [[Haliad III|King Haliad III]] and eventually expanded Chelish control into territories now known as [[Molthune]], [[Nidal]], [[Nirmathas]], [[Varisia]], and the [[Hold of Belkzen]]. The Everwar lasted through the reigns of five Chelish monarchs and finally ended in [[4410 AR]].


## Conquests

> King Haliad III first set his sites to the north, claiming land in what is now Molthune, Varisia, and Nidal. The [[Umbral Court]] of Nidal resist the Chelish invaders for decades, but finally surrendered to them in [[4338 AR]]. After this, Nidal became heavily influenced by Chelish culture, even going to far as to open its ports to foreign trade, a practice that would have been considered unthinkable in the shadowy and xenophobic nation before then.
> During the Everwar, Cheliax sent an expeditionary force into northern [[Garund]] to secure the land south of the [[Arch of Aroden]]. A foothold was established in northwestern [[Rahadoum]] in the province of [[Kharijite]]. To this day, the people in that region consider themselves more Chelish than Rahadoumi.


## End of the Everwar

> The Everwar finally came to a close in 4410 AR when the Chelish crown ceded its territorial ambitions in Varisia and the Hold of Belkzen.
