 Taldor.
> The **Dragon Plague** ([[3660 AR|3660]]–[[3672 AR]]) was a period of intense attacks by [[Dragon|dragons]] in northern [[Taldor]] brought about when a failed attempt to use an *[[Orb of Dragonkind]]* drove Taldor's [[Metallic dragon|metallic dragons]] into a frenzy of destructive rage.
> The [[Krearis Prefecture]] was the most severely affected by the Dragon Plague. The region is characterized by greatly varied terrain and environments, including rolling plains, peat swamps, the woodlands of the [[Verduran Forest]], and the peaks and foothills of the [[World's Edge Mountains|Worlds Edge Mountains]]; as such, it was home to a great variety of dragon species and individual dragons, leaving the area especially vulnerable to their sudden attacks.


## Legacy

> One of the long-term effects of the Plague was its contribution to the end of Taldan dominance of [[Avistan]], as the costs of repairing the damage it caused to the Taldan heartlands proved to be a source of frustration and discontent among the empire's outer holdings.
> Following the end of the Dragon Plague and the deaths of most of the metallic dragons involved, [[Chromatic dragon|chromatic dragons]] from across Avistan flocked to Taldor to take advantage of the power vacuum left by the recent absence of their metallic rivals; this, in turn, led to a century of bloody conflict between the chromatic dragons and the local [[Human|humans]], contributing to legacy of dragonslaying still present in Taldan culture.
