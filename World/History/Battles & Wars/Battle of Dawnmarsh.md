> The **Battle of Dawnmarsh** was one of the last major battles during [[Tar-Baphon|the Whispering Tyrants]] conquest of [[Ustalav]]. It was in this battle that the Last King of Ustalav, King [[Ardurras Virholt]], was slain by Tar-Baphon's undead hordes. With the death of King Ardurras, most resistance against the Whispering Tyrant's forces crumbled and the undead monarch's armies captured [[Ardis]], then-capital of Ustalav soon thereafter.
> In the historical novel *[[In the Council of Corpses]]* by [[Ailson Kindler]], the appearance amongst the Tyrant's forces of the re-animated corpse of [[Tyrus Ildimion]], a young guard previously slain in the king's service, caused the King to falter and led to his death.
