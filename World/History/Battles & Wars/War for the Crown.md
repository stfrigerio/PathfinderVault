But things are not as they should be in the First Emperor's resplendent halls. Can the heroes save not just Taldor, but the legend who founded it, or will they discover the hard way that even a city of light casts long shadows?

But as they return triumphant, they find themselves not celebrated but hated, hunted, and accused of regicide. To set the world right and end the War for the Crown, the heroes must confront not one but six of Taldor's greatest emperors, resurrected from the past by equal parts malice and hubris!
