> In the decisive **Battle of Red Hail** in [[4701 AR]], [[Solku]]'s defenders broke the [[Siege of Solku]] defeating the [[World/Geography/Mountains & Hills/Gnoll|gnolls]] from [[White Canyon]] led by [[Rath Sandstalker]]. It was a costly victory in which many defenders were lost, including Lord Hanif Osahar and all the [[Paladin|paladins]] of [[Iomedae]] who had come to Solku's aid.
