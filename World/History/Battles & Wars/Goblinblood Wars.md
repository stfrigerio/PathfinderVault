> The **Goblinblood Wars** ([[4697 AR]] — [[4701 AR]]) were a series of conflicts first fought between the army of [[Isger]] and hundreds of [[Goblinoid|goblinoid]] tribes of the [[Chitterwood]]. It eventually expanded to include forces from neighboring nations in an effort to contain the rapidly expanding hordes.



## The Wars

> In the four year span beginning in 4697 AR, [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]] commanders led hundreds of hobgoblin and [[Goblin|goblin]] tribes, primarily from [[Isger|Isgers]] [[Chitterwood]], to attack countless rural settlements in that nation. A series of wars resulted, from [[Varisia]] to [[Taldor]], as [[Human|humanity]] struggled against the goblinoids who spread across the surface world, attacking and eating everything in their path. The organization of the hobgoblins made these goblinoid tribes particularly dangerous. The government in [[Elidir]] was at first slow to respond to the goblin menace, perhaps because most of the fighting took place in the nation's more rural areas, leaving the capital largely unscathed. This discrepancy created a fair amount of resentment in Isger's hinterlands, with many declaring that nation's military response would have come much sooner had the capital been threatened.
> Untold number of travelers and merchants died along the [[Conerica Straits]], and whole towns were destroyed as far from the Chitterwood as the [[Five Kings Mountains]]. The size and deadliness of these attacks triggered an unlikely alliance of neighboring powers to become involved: a small order of [[Hellknights]] from [[Cheliax]], a contingent of [[Druma|Drumas]] [[Mercenary League]], and a regiment of [[Eagle Knights]] of [[Andoran]]. They combined forces to fight the goblin hordes and contain their spread beyond Isger. Although the alliance was eventually able to destroy the goblinoid forces and drive the survivors back to the Chitterwood, the number of dead on all sides were staggering.


## Aftermath

> Much of the Chitterwood was burned to the ground after the war, causing any goblinoid survivors to hide in caverns below the forests. Notable tribes among these survivors are the [[True Hoard]], the [[Spine Threshers]], and the [[People of the Stirge]]. Isger's army was so devastated by the Goblinblood Wars that its steward, [[Hedvend VI]], ordered his remaining forces to ignore most of the country and concentrate its effort along the vital trade route along the [[Conerica River]]. As a result much of Isger's hinterlands fell into banditry, which in turn caused the steward to offer bounties for bandit leaders in the hopes of attracting foreign mercenaries to deal with the problem; whether he succeeded in this strategy has yet to be determined.


### Greenskin Stalkers

> The [[Greenskin Stalkers]] are a group that formed during the Goblinblood Wars, but has remained active in the years since. Members specialize in the killing of goblinoid foes and the protection of Isger's population, and have become notorious for their guerilla tactics and occasional suicidal dedication. The group's popularity has grown, and has even spread to neighboring nations with their own goblinoid problems, such as [[Varisia]], and the [[River Kingdoms]].


### Andoran

> The quality of life for the residents of [[Darkmoon Vale]] was so poor following the war that the Eagle Knights passing through decided to expand the outpost of [[Adamas]] into a fully-fledged fortress.


### Molthune

> At the wars' close, many hobgoblins were driven north into the [[Menador Mountains]] and [[Molthune]], where the embattled Molthuni started to recruit these hobgoblin veterans as mercenaries in their fight against [[Nirmathas]].


### Orphans

> The casualties of war and years of unchecked banditry left behind hordes of Isgeri orphans. The only institution to respond to their plight has been the church of [[Asmodeus]]. [[House Thrune]] supports orphanages throughout Isger, most prominently those run by the [[Sisters of the Golden Erinyes]] who take care of the orphans while indoctrinating them into their dark cult.


### Undead

> Another aftermath of the wars and the bandit takeover was that [[Necromancer|necromancers]] and other servants of [[Urgathoa]] established themselves in the burnt-out villages in the Isgeri hinterlands, leading to a great increase in the area's [[Undead|undead]] population. The most prominent of these is the [[Kaltessa Iyis|Lady Kaltess Iyis]], a servant of the [[Archdevil|archdevil]] [[Mammon]], who is said to be building a growing army of undead soldiers from the Goblinblood Wars' dead.
