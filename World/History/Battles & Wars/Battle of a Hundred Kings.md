> The **Battle of a Hundred Kings** took place in [[4639 AR]] and proved to be the decisive battle in the thirty-year [[Chelish Civil War]] that erupted in [[Cheliax]] following the death of [[Aroden]]. [[House Thrune]] and its [[Devil|diabolical]] allies defended the forts of the city of [[Corentyn]] from a joint attack by the army of [[House Davian]] and a navy funded in part by [[Grallus|Baron Grallus]] of [[Sargava]].


## Victory

> House Thrune emerged victorious. The defeat ended House Davian's hopes of claiming the throne and, in [[4640 AR]], House Thrune finally gained control of the country. Corentyn itself still bears the scars of the battle.
