> In [[3444 AR]], descendants of Queen [[Jadwiga]] in then [[Hoarwood province|Hoarwood]]'s provincial capital [[Vonosh]] plotted to overthrow Queen [[Morgannan]], and slew her daughter, Duchess Anisya Morgannan. The coup failed and Queen Morgannan executed all residents of Vonosh regardless of guilt or innocence and razed the city to the ground in a storm of fire and ice.
> Morgannan then ordered that a new capital be carved from an enormous oak tree to the east of the ruins of Vonosh. The great oak was sacred to the [[Ulfen]] [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]] of [[Hoarwood Forest]] and the druids and peasants resisted in one of the greatest rebellions in [[Irrisen]]'s history, known as the **Hoarwood Rebellion** in [[3445 AR]]. Queen Morgannan crushed the rebellion and fed the roots of the mighty sacred oak with the blood of hundreds of the rebels, killing the oak in the process.
> Though the Hoarwood Rebellion was ultimately crushed, it gave rise to an underground resistance organization known as the [[Heralds of Summer's Return|Heralds of Summers Return]].
