> The **Giantkin War** in the history of the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]] began in [[-450 AR]] when the [[Giant|giants]] of the lands south of the [[Grungir Forest]] ([[Cyrusian|Old Cyrusian]]), and the [[Ironbound Archipelago]] ([[Edasseril|Old Edasseril]]) united under the rule of the [[Rune giant|rune giant]] [[Ledamaru|Queen Ledamaru]]. The giants had been suffering for long attacks from the [[Ulfen]] warriors. Queen Ledamaru launched a brutal 4-year assault on the Linnorm Kingdoms that threw the northern land into chaos. [[Kalsgard]] endured a 3-month siege when the aging [[Ulvass|King Ulvass]] decided to fight back. The army of King Ulvass repelled the giants and drove them back into Old Cyrusian, slaughtering giants all the way to the city of [[Torandey]]. When the Ulfen reached the capital city, Queen Ledamaru in desperation used an ancient [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] weapon which brought the entire city of [[Torandey]] down on the heads of [[Human|human]] and giant alike, destroying King Ulvass and his army.
> The Ulfen assumed that it was the actions of their king that destroyed the city and, bolstered by the news, more Ulfen armies invaded Old Cyrusian. By [[-440 AR]] all major giant tribes had been driven out of the region, forced to find shelter in the [[Kodar Mountains]] or in the Ironbound Islands.
