 Then-[[Mortal|mortal]] [[Iomedae]] and the [[Knights of Ozem]] battle [[Erum-Hel]] and his [[Undead|undead]] minions during the [[Shining Crusade]].
> The **Battle of Three Sorrows** was fought during the [[Shining Crusade]] and occurred in [[3823 AR]]. It is chiefly remembered for being the place where that the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] chose to return the body of [[Arazni]], the slain [[Herald|herald]] of [[Aroden]], to the [[Knights of Ozem]]. It is also told that the then mortal [[Iomedae]] battled [[Erum-Hel]], [[Mohrg|Lord of Mohrgs]], and caused him such a grievous wound, that he retreated to the [[Darklands]] realm of [[Orv]]. This latter fight was enshrined as the fifth of the eleven [[Acts of Iomedae]], stories collected by the followers of the [[Iomedae|Inheritor]] to serve as examples of great virtue and valor.
