> The **Freedom War**, also known as the **Northern Rebellion**, was a war of independence fought from [[4648 AR]] to [[4655 AR]] between the newly liberated nation of [[Molthune]] and the rebel forces under the command of the [[Half-elf|half-elven]] trapper [[Irgal Nirmath]]. It ended in victory for the rebels, who subsequently formed the nation of [[Nirmathas]].


## History

> The death of [[Aroden]] brought political instability to countless nations throughout [[Golarion]]. Caught up in a civil war, the [[Cheliax|Chelaxian Empire]] was unable to hold on to its outlying provinces, which splintered off to form their own governments after centuries of centralized control. One of the first of these was the nation of [[Molthune]], which seceded in [[4632 AR]] and claimed all lands between the [[Nosam River]] and the southern border of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] as their own. The peace did not last long, however, as the independent peoples of the southern [[Fangwood]] (from the [[Marideth River|Marideth]] to the [[Tourondel River|Tourondel Rivers]]) began to grow resentful of what they saw as meddling by the capital city of [[Canorate]]. This unhappiness fueled acts of sabotage against the southern government and eventually grew into a full-fledged guerrilla war in [[4648 AR]].
> The northern rebels were largely disorganized woodsmen, who suffered harsh defeats at the hands of the better-trained Molthuni forces. This started changing when a half-elven trapper named Irgal Nirmath emerged as the rebel's leader. He united the disparate groups and began to inflict losses against the southern armies. As his victories mounted and the legend of Nirmath spread, the rebel army renamed themselves [[Irgal's Axe|Irgals Axe]]. The conflict came to a close under a shaky peace signed in [[4655 AR]]. Before the northern forces could declare their independence, however, Irgal Nirmath was slain by an assassin. In honor of their fallen leader, the people decided to name their new nation Nirmathas.
