> The **Conjured Siege** was an unsuccessful attack on the city-state of [[Absalom]] by the [[Arclords of Nex]] in [[2850 AR]]. Bitter after the loss of the island of [[Jalmeray]] to the [[Vudrani (human ethnicity)|Vudrani]], the Arclords spent great amounts of [[Money|money]], [[Time|time]], and influence to hire, [[Summon|summon]], [[Charm|charm]], and even [[Magic|magically]] create an army to attack the city. Supplies during the siege became critically low, and Absalom nearly lost the siege due to their military commanders' incompetence. In addition, Absalom's foreign allies decided not to come to its aid, assuming they could take over the city once the Arclords finished with it. Absalom eventually defeated the attackers by rediscovering its own strength, focusing all its efforts on its defense on pain of death, and hiring ruthless mercenaries, assassins, and [[Demon|demon summoners]]. They were also assisted by the [[Ashawar Lancers]], a company of Vudrani soldiers, who had already successfully defeated the Arclords on Jalmeray.
