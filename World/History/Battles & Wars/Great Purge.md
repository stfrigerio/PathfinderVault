> [[Stavian I|Grand Prince Stavian I]] of [[Taldor]] during the [[Grand Campaign]] targeted the religion of [[Sarenrae]], as one aspect of [[Qadira|Qadiran]] society. This easy target helped him to unite his nation against the enemy. In [[4528 AR]], he made the worshiping of Sarenrae illegal in Taldor and propagandized the [[Cult of the Dawnflower]] as treasonous spies. The Taldan society turned against Sarenrae's followers in Taldor and, in a matter of months, all of her temples and places of worship were destroyed and the Dawnflower's [[Cleric|clerics]] and followers were murdered or expelled. This event is known as the **Great Purge**.
> In part, the Great Purge was sparked due to a Sarenite soothsayer claiming that one of six children of [[Grand Prince]] [[Micheaux|Micheaux the Magnificent]] (which included Stavian I) was a bastard. Upon taking the crown in [[4526 AR]], Stavian I believed that the infighting with his siblings was a direct result of this prophesy. Declaring the oracle a traitor and his faith, by extension, also treacherous, the Grand Purge began. 
> The Great Purge was formerly known as the **Great Burning of Witches**. This become something of a misnomer as fewer than a hundred Sarenite 'witches' were burned in total.
