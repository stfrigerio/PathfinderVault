> The **Battle at Deadeye's Gulch**, in [[4649 AR]], was a week-long battle in the [[Freedom War]] between [[Molthuni]] forces and [[Nirmathi]] separatists. The result killed many on both sides and was the Freedom War's bloodiest battle; while neither side won ground in [[Deadeye's Gulch|Deadeyes Gulch]], it divided Molthune's forces enough for rebels to reclaim the city of [[Tamran]] six months after Molthune had seized it for the third time in three years.
> The death and regional instability has left the gulch with a haunted reputation, and the gulch is now known as Deadeye's Haunt.
