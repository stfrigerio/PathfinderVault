> The **Battle of Kridorn** was a battle between [[Iobar I|King Iobar I]] of [[Iobaria]], and the corsairs of the northwestern [[Castrovin Sea]] in [[937 AR]]. The battle was waged near the fishing town of [[Kridorn]], a frequent target for the [[Pirate|pirates]], and resulted in the death of King Iobar I. However, his son, [[Hrugil]], would go on to rout the pirates and drive them out of Eastern Iobaria, and spend the remainder of his reign building up Iobaria's fleets with the intent of destroying the pirate fleets.
