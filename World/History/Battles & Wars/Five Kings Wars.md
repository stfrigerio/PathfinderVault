***Main article: [[History of the Five Kings Mountains]]***
> Nine years after the founding of the last of the five ancient [[Dwarf|dwarven]] kingdoms in [[Five Kings Mountains]] ([[Gardadth]], [[Saggorak]], [[Doggadth]], [[Grakodan]], and [[Taggoret (city)|Taggoret]]), the first of no less than nineteen civil wars broke out in [[1571 AR]]. These **Five Kings Wars** lasted over 700 years, only ending when the dwarves tired of the carnage and decided to go to negotiations. With the help of a [[Human|human]] delegation from [[Druma]], the dwarves negotiated the [[Kerse Accord]] in [[2332 AR]]. This treaty ended the civil wars and began a long-lasting peace. Great towering [[Carved Kings|sculptures of the five kings]] were carved at the highest peaks of the mountains to celebrate the treaty.
