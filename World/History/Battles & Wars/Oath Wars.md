 The [[Laws of Mortality]].
> The **Oath Wars** were a large conflict between the clergies of [[Nethys]], [[Norgorber]], and [[Sarenrae]] in order to decide which among them would become the dominant religion in northwestern [[Garund]]. The battles began in [[2498 AR]], when the newly embraced religion of Sarenrae spreading into the region, coming into conflict with the already established religions of Nethys and Norgorber. Once it began, it became an all-out war between the zealots of the three religions.
> This large conflict devastated the entire region and likely would have continued, had not the city of [[Azir]] exiled all clergy from its territory. Led by the [[Philosopher|philosopher]] [[Kalim Onaku]], the city created the [[Laws of Mortality]], the first of which barred the worship of any deity. The Laws spread throughout the region, causing the total eviction of all religiously-minded people on pain of death. Thus emptied of its original instigators, the Oath Wars ended in [[2560 AR]] and the country of [[Rahadoum]] was founded.
