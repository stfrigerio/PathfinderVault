> An **equinox** is an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] phenomenon commonly regarded as the instant of time when [[Golarion|Golarions]] equator would, if extended outward as a plane, pass through the center of its [[Sun|sun]]; in other words, it is the moment at which the center of the visible sun is directly above the equator. In the northern hemisphere, the early equinox on the [[Absalom Reckoning]] calendar is called the **vernal** or **spring equinox**, and the late equinox is called the **autumnal** or **fall equinox**. The vernal equinox on the northern hemisphere is the autumnal equinox on the southern hemisphere, and vice versa.
> Several [[Holiday|holidays]] on Golarion are celebrated on equinoxes, including the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] [[Days of Wrath]] on both equinoxes; on the vernal equinox, the [[Gozreh|Gozren]] fertility celebration of [[Firstbloom]], [[First Cut]] in [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]], and Planting Week for followers of [[Erastil]]; and on the autumnal equinox, [[Erastil]]'s [[Harvest Feast]], the [[Desna|Desnan]] [[Swallowtail Festival]], and the Festival of Night's Return in [[Nidal]].
