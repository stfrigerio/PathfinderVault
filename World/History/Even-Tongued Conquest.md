> The **Even-Tongued Conquest** ([[4081 AR|4081]]–[[4091 AR]]), also known (especially in [[Taldor]]) as the **Even-Tongued Rebellion**, began with the declaration of [[Cheliax|Chelish]] independence from [[Taldor]]. [[4079 AR|Two years earlier]], a major [[Qadira|Qadiran]] invasion of southern Taldor had begun, tying up the Taldan armies for the foreseeable future. Seeing this, [[Aspex the Even-Tongued]], a Taldan governor, consolidated the armies under his command, and declared all territory west of the [[Sellen River]] to belong to the new nation of [[Cheliax]]. As the Taldor–Qadira conflict (later to be known as the [[Grand Campaign]]) continued, King Aspex annexed the Taldan provinces of [[Galt]] and [[Isger]] by threat of force, and convinced [[Andoran]] and the [[Strix|strix]] of [[Devil's Perch|Devils Perch]] to join his new nation. A decade after Aspex declared independence, Taldor had lost nearly half its land area without a battle fought. This was commemorated across Cheliax as an annual celebration, [[Even-Tongued Day]], until the [[Age of Lost Omens]]. It remains  a holiday in modern Cheliax and its former territories, but is now primarily a day of mourning, as the events of the [[Chelish Civil War]] make both [[Thrune Ascendancy|Infernal Cheliax]] and its independent territories consider its size at founding cause for regret, for different reasons.
> The nation of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]], previously a Taldan protectorate, declared its neutrality during this conflict. This was effectively also an independence movement, in that it was no longer principally protected or funded by any one nation.
