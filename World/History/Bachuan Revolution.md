 The revolutionary flag of [[Bachuan]]
> The **Bachuan Revolution** laid the foundation of the [[Bachuan|Republic of Bachuan]]. Formerly known as Pen Wa, an outlying province of great [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]], the province's greedy officials and their corrupt priestly allies struggled to control the impoverished peasant class following the empire's fall in [[4606 AR]]. In this era of political chaos, the peasant-philosopher [[Grandfather Pei]] arose preaching the secular gospel of [[Communism|communism]] and rallied the abused and downtrodden farmers, miners, and fishermen under a new banner: a [[Tiger|tiger]] (representing the peasants) chasing an [[Imperial dragon|imperial dragon]] (the aristocracy) around a sun.
> Although the Revolution failed to take the imperial [[Ten Thousand Summer Palace]], the rest of Pen Wa was overtaken, religion was outlawed, and a new order of wealth distribution and state-enforced equality was instituted. Re-education camps were created to instil proper communist values in the populace. Grandfather Pei founded the [[Sun Chamber]] to govern the new nation, to which he restored its original, pre-imperial name: Bachuan.
