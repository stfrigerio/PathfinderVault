> **Greensteeples** is the family estate of the [[Half-elf|half-elf]] scion [[Varian Jeggare|Count Varian Jeggare]], located in the Old Egorian neighborhood of [[Sorrowside]] in [[Cheliax]].
> Built in the old Chelish style predating the rise of [[House Thrune]], Greensteeples is covered in ivy and looks somewhat quaint next to the black-and-red monstrosities that have gone up in the last 70 years. Count Jeggare is served by a small, but loyal cadre of [[Halfling|halfling]] servants, many of whom have served at Greensteeples for generations. Besides the master's and servants' quarters, Greensteeples also contains an extensive library (as Jeggare is secretly a [[Venture-captain|venture-captain]] in the [[Pathfinder Society]]), a garden, and a solarium.
> In recent years, Jeggare has actively used Greensteeples as a [[Pathfinder lodge]] in defiance of the empire's ban on them within its borders.
