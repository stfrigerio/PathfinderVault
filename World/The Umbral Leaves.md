 Zon-Kuthon's Unholy Symbol.
> ***The Umbral Leaves*** is the grisly and [[Unholy|unholy]] book of the [[Deity|god]] [[Zon-Kuthon]], the Midnight Lord, where the tenets and laws of his faith are detailed. It is written in blood on pages of flayed skin, sometimes in a single piece from the head of a victim, so that the face is the cover. Commonly, the text is written in [[Human|human]] blood. *The Umbral Leaves* is a translation of the original work, written by a mad prophet of his church, into [[Taldane]].


## Nidal

> As a nation ruled by the tenets of Zon-Kuthon, [[Nidal]] adopts *The Umbral Leaves* as the closest it has to a constitution.
