> **Sauerton Red** is a cheap red wine manufactured in the [[Andoran]] village of [[Sauerton]] in northeastern [[Andoran]].  It is known throughout the [[Inner Sea]] for its poor taste and cheap quality.  The wine is so ubiquitous that the expression "down from Sauerton" is a euphemism applied to poor craftsmanship of all kinds throughout Andoran and the neighboring regions.
