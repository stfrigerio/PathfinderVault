> A **religious symbol** is both a unique figurative representation of a [[Deity|deity]], and a literal symbol of that god that is owned or worn by their followers. Symbols of [[PathfinderWiki/Religion/Good|benign]] or [[Neutral|neutral]] gods are sometimes specified as **holy symbols**, while **unholy symbol** is used for those of [[Evil|evil]] powers. Certain devout followers of a god (such as [[Cleric|clerics]]) must use a religious symbol to channel [[Positive energy|positive]] and [[Negative energy|negative energy]]. Certain [[Divine magic|divine]] [[Spell|spells]] also require a symbol as a divine focus for casting. A symbol can be made of any number of materials, including wood or [[Silver|silver]].
