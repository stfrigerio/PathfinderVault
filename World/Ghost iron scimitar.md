> [[Xin]] created the ***ghost iron scimitar*** in response to the [[Runelords]] creating the seven [[Alara'hai|Alarahai]]. His experiment was ultimately a failure as this [[Inubrix|inubrix]] [[Scimitar|scimitar]] did not develop intelligence. However, it has many valuable powers. [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor]] and [[Shield|shields]] are not able to provide protection against this [[Sword|sword]]. Despite being made of a soft metal, its [[Magic|magical]] hardening is sufficient for it to be treated as a normal sword. In addition, the sword can move and attack on its own, deliver exceptionally devastating cuts, and harm incorporeal creatures.
