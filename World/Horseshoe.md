 Horseshoes need not be as elaborate as those worn by this [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]] mount.
> **Horseshoes** shield equine hooves from wear and hazards on the ground. While most commonly made of [[Iron|iron]], they can be made of other more exotic [[Metal|metals]], such as [[Mithral|mithral]] or [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Materials/Adamantine|adamantine]]. A specialized blacksmith who equips horseshoes is known as a **farrier**, and works on [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Horse|horses]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Geography/Cities/Centaur|centaurs]] alike.



## As magic items

> Horseshoes can be [[Magic item|enchanted]] with magical effects ranging from speed to levitation, to aiding in stampeding and hoof strikes in combat, or even to increase a horse's size, turn it into mist, or transform it into an infernal-looking beast. *Clandestine horseshoes* help the shod creature and its rider hide or even turn invisible.


## As a game

> "Horseshoes" can also refer to a game where players attempt to have a stake planted in the ground catch an iron horseshoe thrown at it from a distance.
