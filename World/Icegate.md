> **Icegate** is an active [[Elf gate|elf gate]] located in the far north where [[Avistan]] meets the [[Crown of the World]]. The climate in the region is harsh. The nearby small lake remains frozen all year round, and heavy snowfalls are common.
> Icegate appears as a pale arch, nine feet in height, carved into a stony outcropping. It connects to [[Lichgate]], and can also be reached from the [[Galtgate]] hub. Its portal key is a moonstone.
> This is not a popular destination for travellers, as it is within the territory of the [[Ilverani]] - a culture of [[Elf|elves]] who are extremely hostile towards outsiders.
