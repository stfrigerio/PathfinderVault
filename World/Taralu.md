> The **Taralu** [[Dwarf|dwarves]] live in the eastern jungles of the [[Mwangi Expanse]]. They are one of the two main dwarven groupings in the Expanse, but have little contact with the other group: the [[Mbe'ke|Mbeke]] dwarves of the [[Terwa Uplands]].
> They once lived in the [[Shattered Range]], but abandoned their cities and migrated westwards into the Expanse for some unknown reason. They no longer practice most dwarven traditions. Instead, they engage in [[Ancestor worship|ancestor worship]] and [[Shamanism|totemism]]. They view [[Dragon|dragons]] and [[Wyvern|wyverns]] as [[Holy|holy]] creatures. They are usually friendly towards other races.
> There are also a number of Taralu dwarves living in [[Kibwe]], where they have gained a reputation for being trustworthy guides.
