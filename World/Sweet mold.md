> **Sweet mold** is a [[Fungus|fungus]] that grows in the wetter tunnels of the [[Darklands]] where it provides a steady food source. It gets its name from its sweet flavor, which is particularly popular with [[Cave fisher|cave fishers]], [[Mobat|mobats]], and [[Roper|ropers]]. It is mildly [[Poison|poisonous]] to [[Humanoid|humanoids]] and is a poor source of nutrition, but is occasionally roasted or fried to bring out its sweetness.
