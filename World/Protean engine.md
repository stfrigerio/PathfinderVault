> ***Protean engines*** are rare [[Magic|magical]] devices that are used to power the [[Ship|wheelboats]] of the [[Aspis Consortium]]. They draw upon the [[Transmutation|transmutation]] abilities of the [[Arcophage|arcophage]], a magical fungus found only in the [[Mwangi Expanse]], which is then transferred via a flywheel to the vessel's paddlewheel. One arcophage can power an engine for about a month.
> The *protean engine* was invented by the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] inventor [[Arthox Sandlespit]] on behalf of the Consortium. He was only able to build a handful of engines before he died in a mysterious fire which also consumed all of his notes. So far, no one has been able to duplicate his work, and the Consortium carefully guards the remaining engines.
