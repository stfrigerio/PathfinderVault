*This article is about the prison for violent criminals in [[Korvosa]]. For the [[Andoren]] town, see [[Longacre]]. For that town's armory, see Longacre Armory.*
> The **Longacre Building**, one of [[Korvosa|Korvosas]] largest buildings, is home to its feared [[Arbiters Korvosa|Arbiters]], after whom the building is also known as **Arbiter's Hall**. It is the site of the city's executions of violent criminals. Neck-snapping hangings take place in the building, located west of City Hall in [[North Point]], while beheadings by [[Axe|axe]] occur beneath the building in the **Deathhead Vault**.
> Due to the large amount of [[Undead|undead]] activity in Longacre—second in the city to only the Gray District necropolis—[[Abadar|Abadaran]] and [[Pharasmin]] [[Cleric|clerics]] regularly patrol the building.
> The building also has a reputation for strange disappearances of prisoners, sometimes for years at a time and often permanently. Those who do return retain only fragmented memories of what happened during their absence; of those who do not, some who work in Longacre insist that some malevolence from below drags prisoners away.
