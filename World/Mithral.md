> **Mithral** is a beautiful, but rare, [[Silver|silvery]] metal that has the strength and hardness of steel but is much lighter. Mithral is [[Magnetic|magnetic]], and has the same [[Anathematic|anathematic]] capability as [[Alchemical silver|alchemical silver]] in overcoming some creatures' resistances to normal [[Weapon|weapons]] or *magic circles*, such as [[Lycanthrope|lycanthropes]].
> [[Armour]] is the most common use of the metal: mithral armour is very light and restricts movement far less than even masterwork steel armour.
> Off the battlefield, mithral is sometimes used in cookware as food rarely sticks to it. Of course, such items are very rare due to the prohibitive cost of using mithral for such mundane purposes. It is also used to craft thin, lightweight, but sturdy [[Horseshoe|horseshoes]].
