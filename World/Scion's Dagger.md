> ***Scion's Dagger*** is an elegant [[Dagger|dagger]] decorated with a large black sapphire, forged by [[Grand Prince]] Penticus IV to protect his eldest son Penticus V, who was promised to strange [[Outsider|outsiders]] so his father could take the [[Taldor|Taldan]] crown. Penticus V later used this dagger to commit suicide, denying his father's patrons and letting his brother [[Tralian V]] take the throne.
> The owner of *Scion's Dagger* can designate up to four willing creatures as bodyguards who can sense the owner's status while the blade is held in the wielder's hands. If the owner dies while wielding *Scion's Dagger*, their [[Soul|soul]] is transferred into the black sapphire (if it is not currently occupied by another soul), and can be resurrected or released to the [[River of Souls|afterlife]] by anyone holding the dagger.
