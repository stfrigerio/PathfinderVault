> The pirate lords of [[Issia]] (now part of [[Brevoy]]) once engaged one another in a massive naval battle on the [[Lake of Mists and Veils]]. During the battle, the fleets were caught up in a massive storm and wrecked off the coast of Brevoy in [[Jellicoe Bay]]. The wreckage remains there to this day, and is known as the **Jundlan Wrecks**. Presumably a considerable amount of [[Pirate|pirate]] treasure can be found amongst the frost-covered tangle of wrecked [[Ship|ships]] and ancient, waterlogged corpses. However, numerous unfriendly [[Fey|fey]] now live amongst the destruction, building altars and structures made from the dead pirates' treasure. On [[Moon|moonless]] nights, ghostly bells can be heard tolling here at midnight, and gangplanks made of bone extend from the shipwrecks, inviting all to come on board.
