> **Scrapwall** is the name given to the 3-mile-long wreckage of a [[Starship|starship]] that fell to [[Golarion]] thousands of years ago during the [[Rain of Stars]]. It is located in eastern [[Numeria]] on the [[Sellen River]], south of the port city of [[Chesed]]. Stripped of any valuable [[Technology|technology]] or [[Skymetal|skymetals]] long ago, Scrapwall still attracts scavengers and fortune hunters following dubious rumors from time to time. Nowadays these people are preyed upon by deadly beasts and bandits who take advantage of those desperate enough to make the trek here.
