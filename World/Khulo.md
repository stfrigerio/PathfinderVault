> The seaside town of Khulo, the only settlement on [[Valkus Isle]], was once a favorite pleasure resort of the nobility of [[Nex]]. Failed experiments carried out in the island's interior by the archmage [[Nex (person)|Nex]] saw the island overrun by dangerous planar forces and monsters, with unfortunate results for the town's population. The chaos meant that the settlement was run by crime lords and spirit nagas vying for power.
> Today, the town (like the rest of the island) is cut off from civilization by the protective [[Stalwart Wall]] so it is unknown what creatures (if any) currently dwell there.
