> **Harpy's Gate** is in the middle of the half-finished eastern town wall of the town of [[Diobel]]. It is named for the [[Harpy|creatures]] that plague the town and serves as a checkpoint for caravans. Caravan captains strike their bargains with traders that want to bring their goods to [[Absalom]], but for various reasons choose to dock at Diobel and travel over-land.
