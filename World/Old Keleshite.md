## History

> Old Keleshite encompasses the ancient tribal languages spoken within the Padishah Empire of Kelesh, which were more grammatically complex than modern [[Kelish]] with sounds not commonly used in other regions. Their unique and often difficult nature slowed the spread of [[Keleshite human ethnicity|Keleshite]] influence, leading merchants to create a simplified trade version that shared more in common phonologically with languages found outside of [[Casmaron]].
