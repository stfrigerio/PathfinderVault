> **Saem-Kyrs** was the most trusted [[Hellknight ranks|paralictor]] of [[Voltarios|Voltarios the Scourge]], [[Hellknight ranks|lictor]] of the [[Hellknights]] [[Order of the Nail]]. When Voltarios accepted [[Domina Arabasti|Queen Domina Arabastis]] offer to fund the order's new citadel in [[Varisia]], he assigned the project to Paralictor Saem-Kyrs. At first, under Saem-Kyrs's draconian leadership, the project was executed without delays but as Saem-Kyrs was spending increasingly longer hours in the foundations of the growing fortress, he grew gradually more and more [[Madness|paranoid]]. The project started to fall behind schedule and the paralictor began to ignore his superiors. Finally, Saem-Kyrs tried to seize the castle with a loyal force of Hellknights, attempting to create a kingdom of Hellknights. Lictor Voltarios anticipated the coup, if not secretly encouraging it, and so, on the evening Saem-Kyrs declared his move, Voltarios' assassins slew him along with several dozen renegade Hellknights. After the incident, Voltarios burned all records of Saem-Kyrs, as well as the floor plans of the castle, blaming the destruction on the insurgents and ensuring [[Citadel Vraid|Citadel Vraids]] floor plans remained a secret.
