> The **Troll's Tail River**, usually called just the **Troll's Tail**, forms a sweeping curve that acts as the northern part of the border between the [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] Palatinate counties of [[Lozeri]] and [[Vieland]]. Additionally, it marks the eastern bounds of the [[Dippelmere Swamp]], demarcating the swamp from the vast [[Shudderwood]] on its opposite bank. From its source the river runs for some forty miles until, ultimately, the Troll's Tail becomes a tributary of the [[Moutray River]], at the same point that the [[Moutray River|Lesser Moutray River]] also joins.
