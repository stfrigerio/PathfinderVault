*For another meaning of "High Market", please see High Market (Canorate).*
> The **High Market** of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]] offers quality goods, most of them imported but also some rare, local, quality goods. The influential residents of the town shop the various stalls of the High Market for [[Silk|silk]] clothing, shoes, [[Spice|spices]], and jewelry, but also fresh meat and vegetables. The ex-mercenary [[Ayda Vorshin]] runs weekly caravans to and from [[Olfden]] stocking the market with all kind of expensive goods. Local artists such as [[Deveera Gadsel]] offer their wares among the imports. [[Payden Teedum|Boss Teedums]] loyal thugs restrict access to the market, admitting only those [[Thuldrin Kreed]] favors. One of Kreed's men, the middle-aged [[Kilarin Salk]], personally inspects all groceries sold in the market. Kilarin is a failed farmer and notoriously corrupt. Farmers in the region know that a hefty bribe is required to pass her inspection. Any insult to her pride results in a lifetime ban from selling goods in Falcon's Hollow.
