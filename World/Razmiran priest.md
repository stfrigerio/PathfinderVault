> A **Razmiran priest** is a false [[Divine|divine]] caster loyal to the false [[Deity|god]], [[Razmir]], who can readily use [[Arcane|arcane]] [[Spell|spells]] and abilities to make onlookers perceive he is casting divine spells.


## Fake clerics

> Because Razmir is not a true god, his priests cannot cast true [[Divine magic|divine]] spells, instead using [[Arcane magic|arcane magic]] to mask their deficiency. Healing, normally a staple of all [[Cleric|clerics]], is a particular problem for Razmiran priests, who use obscure arcane magic, folk remedies, and so-called "holy" artifacts to cure. They are quite convincing, and are able to dupe most commoners who see them perform their magic.


## Domains

> Razmiran priests are able to exhibit the powers of a divine [[Domain|domain]] as though they were servants of a real god. The domains that Razmir is able to falsely replicate for his followers are [[Charm domain|Charm]], [[Evil domain|Evil]], [[Law domain|Law]], or [[Trickery domain|Trickery]].
