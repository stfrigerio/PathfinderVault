 Merrymead is a holiday popular with Caydenites.
> A [[Holidays and festivals|holiday]] occurring on [[Calistril|2 Calistril]], Merrymead was started in [[Druma]] and is supposed to be a time to share of the last of the previous year's mead with the rest of the community.
> In current times, most people just use it as an excuse to drink excessively. The poor travel from bar to bar drinking whatever [[Alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] they can afford, while the wealthy will set aside specific vintages for this day. A known consequence of this day are 'mead riots' that happen when there are more celebrants than there is alcohol to serve them. This leads to a violent, destructive group of people in a crowded bar. If this is a common occurrence for particular cities, they may reinforce their guard force for the inevitably eventful night.

> This holiday, of course, is almost tailor-made for the faithful of the [[Cayden Cailean|Accidental God]], who celebrate it by gathering around a warm fire and exchanging stories and jokes to hold off winter's cabin fever.
