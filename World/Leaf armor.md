> Using [[Alchemy|alchemical]] compounds, [[Elves|elves]] or [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druidic]] orders treat special leaves for use in crafting [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Armors/Armor|armor]]. These leaves are stitched together in an overlapping pattern to create a leathery armor as strong and deflective as metal counterparts. **Leaf armor** jerkins, bracers, and leggings have been made through this process.
