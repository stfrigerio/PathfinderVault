> A very heavy and inaccurate [[Firearm|firearm]], the **musket** requires two hands to aim. In addition to its accuracy issues, the musket also has a chance to misfire. The high damage potential is the main draw for this 9-pound, smooth-bored gun.


## Variants

> Most muskets have a single barrel, though more expensive and heavier **double-barreled muskets** offer more flexibility and firepower.
> Their haft-like shape and weight inspires some to add melee features to the barrel, typically in the form of a bayonet, and more rarely with an [[Axe|axe]] blade to form an [[Axe musket|axe musket]] or [[Hammer|hammerhead]] to form a warhammer musket.
> The [[Rifle|rifle]] improves on many of the features found in a musket.


## On Golarion

> Muskets are relatively common in [[Alkenstar]] and are wielded by its [[Shieldmarshal|shieldmarshals]] and guards of [[Cloudreaver Keep]].
> Muskets were among the firearms seized from [[Dongun Hold]] by [[Charau-ka|charau-ka]] of the [[Gorilla King]], who trained several charau-ka to wield them as sharpshooters.
> Some [[Pirate|pirates]] employ musket-wielding snipers who operate from a [[Ship|ships]] crow's nest.
> The musket is the sacred weapon of the [[Daemon|daemon]] [[Harbinger|harbinger]] [[Cixyron]].
