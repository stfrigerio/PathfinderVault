> **Thistle arrows** are made from the thistles of a [[Poison|toxic]] plant and are a specialty of [[Ekujae]] [[Shaman|shamans]]. They craft the arrowheads out of the thistle so that the barb of the thistle stays in the wound and releases the caustic sap, irritating the struck target. Thistle arrows cost 1 [[Gold piece|gold piece]] each from the Ekujae.
