 Milani's holy symbol.
> ***The Light of Hope*** is the sacred text of the minor [[God|goddess]] [[Milani]] and her church. It is often split into two sections:

Milani's history as a [[Mortal|mortal]] (potentially an autobiography penned after she became a saint).
Teachings for mortals, including sermons, prayers and songs.
> Traditionally, pressed roses serve as bookmarks in the text and rose petals are placed in the book to mark special pages when the text is given as a gift.
