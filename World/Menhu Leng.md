> **Menhu Leng** is a ruined city high in the northern [[Wall of Heaven]] mountains of [[Tian Xia]]. Menhu Leng sits in the central portion of the mountain range, an area that is known for its links to the nightmare [[Plane|plane]] of [[Leng]]. The cause of this link is much speculated upon, some believe this is due to the height of the mountains tearing at the very fabric of reality itself, while others speculate that in the most distant reaches of the past the [[Denizen of Leng|denizens of Leng]] worked to create a primal link with the mountains. Whatever the case, the denizens of Leng now rule over the basalt ruins of Menhu Leng, using their winged [[Shantak|shantaks]] to visit across the lands of Tian Xia to further their sinister schemes.
