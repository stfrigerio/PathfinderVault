> The **Low Market** of [[Falcon's Hollow|Falcons Hollow]], sells the [[High Market|High Markets]] leftovers, heavily salted meat and other poor quality foodstuffs. Unlike High Market, Low Market is open to all. It is frequented by hordes of poor lumberjacks, struggling farmers, and outcasts. Almost nothing in the Low Market sells for more than a few [[Currency|gold pieces]]. [[Jasin Greatoak]] organizes the stalls and cart-bound booths. He is a fat man, always friendly but not so clever.
