> The **Serpent Column**, which originated in the ancient [[Azlant|Azlanti]] settlement of [[Oppara]], is the heart of the [[Memorial Park]]. It is actually made of two columns built side-by-side, then twisted together as if by the hands of a [[Giant|giant]]. The column is based on a green-hued stone foundation, and its material is harder than steel. No sign of its age is shown on its smooth surface.
