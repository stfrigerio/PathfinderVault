> The **Grenalf Plateau** is a region of central [[Iobaria]] separated from the rest of the nation by the [[Syrzemyan Highlands]] and immense crevasses. The plateau rests beneath [[Kirya]], and like the temple city it can only be accessed by crossing the treacherous [[Grenalthrost]]. The town of [[Mishkar]] was established in [[809 AR]] to guard against threats from the plateau.
