> The **Imperial Calendar** (commonly abbreviated as **IC**) is the most-commonly used dating system on the continent of [[Tian Xia]], although it is far from the only one. Other popular calendars include the Mithral Count used by the [[Elf|elves]] of [[Jinin]], and the Sovereign Scroll of the Dragon Emperors of [[Xa Hoi]]. The Imperial Calendar counts as its genesis the founding of [[Yixing]], Tian Xia's first empire. As this occurred exactly 2,500 years before the founding of [[Absalom]], conversion between [[Absalom Reckoning]] and the Imperial Calendar is quite easy.


## Ages

> The chroniclers of Tian Xia divide known history into four ages: the [[Age of Dragons]], [[Age of Ashes]], [[Age of Ascendancy]], and the [[Age of Succession]]. The Age of Dragons is largely mythical, and predates humanity's arrival on the continent. The Age of Ashes was ushered in by [[Earthfall]]; even though that event happened on the far side of [[Golarion]], the effects were felt in Tian Xia as well. 
> The Age of Ascendancy began in [[-2499 AR]] with the founding of the first [[Human|human]] empire, [[Yixing]], and lasted until the death of [[Aroden]] and the collapse of the last great empire, [[Lung Wa|Imperial Lung Wa]], which ushered in the current Age of Succession.


> The Imperial Calendar also corresponds to real-world calendars. See [[PathfinderWikiCanon policyRegarding dates|the Canon Policy]] for details.
