> According to ancient legend, the devil [[Alichino]] tasked the legendary hero [[Strada]] with the conquest of an invincible city. Strada sought the help of an oracle of [[Gorum]] and was given the thousand fangs of the dragon Kathalphas. When Strada sowed the teeth into the ground outside the city as instructed, all the heroes the dragon had devoured sprang up into battle. Having frustrated the devil, Strada ruled the city for 90 years with the skeletal army as guard. Magical [[Spartoi seeds|spartoi seeds]] that temporarily summon the skeletal undead warriors known as [[Spartolos|spartoloi]] have been created since in memory of this legend.
