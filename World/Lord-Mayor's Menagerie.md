> The **Lord-Mayor's Menagerie** is actually a public park located in the [[Capital District]] district of [[Magnimar]]. The park has gained it unusually name from the collection of bizarre taxidermy and living creatures that are on display there. [[Canayven Heidmarch]] and [[Sheila Heidmarch]] a pair of local [[Pathfinder Society|Pathfinders]] who run the [[Heidmarch Manor|Heidmarch Manor Lodge]] use the park as a place to display their unique menagerie. This strange collection includes an eyeless and therefore relatively harmless [[Basilisk|basilisk]], a tame fourteen foot tall [[Ape|ape]] named "Prince Mandali" and the egg of a [[Tarn linnorm|tarn linnorm]].
