> **Taumata** was an ancient civilisation of unsurpassed magnificence that eventually angered the very [[Deity|gods]] themselves with their arrogance and were utterly destroyed for it. Taumata covers the area now known as the [[Minata|Wandering Isles of Minata]] but, at the time, rather than an elongated chain of islands, this area was one solid land bridge that reached all the way from [[Tian Xia]] to distant, mysterious [[Sarusan]]. However, in arrogance, the people of Taumata blasphemed against the gods in a manner so reprehensible that [[Hei Feng]] himself descended on them smashing this land ring apart with his nine-ring broadsword before declaring, "Nevermore in unity, lest you think yourselves greater than those who gave you life."
> The smiting of Taumata is believed to have taken place before even the eruption of [[Mount Shibotai]] in [[-2524 AR]]. Nowadays, the ruins of ancient Taumata dot the various islands of Minata. Supposedly, the most intact ruins lie amongst the islands of [[Rendah Pulu]], but due to being infested with [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] tribes and a cult of vile [[Cleric|priests]] and [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]], they are a place even the bravest [[Adventurer|adventurers]] fear to tread.
