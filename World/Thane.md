> **Thane** is a title denoting a person as a retainer to a regent, sometimes equivalent in rank to an earl. The title of thane was common in [[Irrisen]] among the [[Djurstor Confederacy]] prior to [[Baba Yaga|Baba Yagas]] conquest, and many thanes of the Confederacy are interred in the [[Thanegraves]] of western [[Wintercrux]]. It is also used in the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], where the [[Thanelands]] are one of its seven kingdoms and [[Thanesrest Mausoleum]] once served as a mausoleum to kings of [[Broken Bay]].
