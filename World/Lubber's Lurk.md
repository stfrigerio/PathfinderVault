> **Lubber's Lurk** is a cavern that serves as the only land passage that allows access to the main districts of the [[Pirate|pirate]] city of [[Port Peril]]. Most people visiting Port Peril come by sea and even those who arrive overland, from the mainland or the [[Mwangi Expanse]], normally take a ferry into the city, Lubber's Lurk is the reason why. A treacherous series of sea caves, Lubber's Lurk provides land passage but is poorly lit and its branching caves contain bandits, flesh-hungry [[Cave fisher|cave fishers]], and things even worse.
