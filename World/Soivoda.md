> **Soivoda** is a collective term used for the nine counties of eastern [[Ustalav]] still ruled by their hereditary noble families.  The name is taken from the founder of the nation, [[Soividia Ustav]]. They include the provinces of [[Amaans]], [[Ardeal]], [[Barstoi]], [[Caliphas]], [[Odranto]], [[Sinaria]], [[Ulcazar]], [[Varno]], and [[Versex]]; they also include the blasted region of Ardeal known as [[Furcina]], but now known as [[The Furrows|the Furrows]].
> The Soivoda region stands in contrast to the [[Palatinates|Palatine]] counties of [[Canterwall]], [[Lozeri]], and [[Vieland]], which since [[4670 AR]], have thrown off their hereditary rulers, replacing them with councils of prominent citizens.
