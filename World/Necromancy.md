> The [[Magic|magical]] field of **necromancy** is one of the eight [[Schools of magic|schools of magic]] recognized on [[Golarion]]. It is sometimes referred to variously as the **dark arts** or **death magic**. It deals with the manipulation of the essential life force which infuses all living things. Its darker aspect is the creation and control of [[Undead|undead]] creatures. [[Wizard|Wizards]] who specialize in necromantic magic are known as **necromancers**.



## On Golarion

> Some of the most well-known necromancers the world has ever known were undead creatures themselves, such as the archmage [[Geb (person)|Geb]], and the dreaded [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Lich|lich]] known as the [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]]. The goddess [[Urgathoa]] is the patron deity of many necromancers, although some also worship the lesser-known [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Orcus]].


### Notable necromancers

*See also: [[CategoryNecromancers]]*
> Although they can be found throughout the world, the arcane schools of the [[Garund|Garundi]] nation of [[Geb's Rest]] specialize in the teaching of necromancy. One of the most notable is the [[Ebon Mausoleum]] in the capital, [[Mechitar]].


### Materials

> A number of (apparently) naturally occurring materials have necromantic properties.

> - [[Black blood]]
> - [[Lazurite]]

### Sin magic

***Main article: [[Sin magic]]***
> During the reign of the [[Runelords|runelords]] of ancient [[Thassilon]], necromancy was associated with the sin of gluttony, and was therefore the specialty of the ruler of the realm of [[Gastash]].
