> The **Slithering Coast** runs along the south of the [[Shackles]]' mainland, which borders the [[Fever Sea]]. It takes its name from the large populations of sea snakes and [[Water naga|water nagas]] found there.
> Sea snake venom is sought after by [[Alchemist|alchemists]] and poisoners, but the nagas do not welcome those who trespass near their lairs. The nagas are a great source of local knowledge, and some of the [[Free Captains]] try to develop friendly relations with the reclusive creatures in order to take advantage of this resource.
