> **Mhar's Fossa** is a gargantuan tunnel located at the end of a furrow that descends from [[Kadath]], near the extremity of the [[Leng|Plateau of Leng]]. It was created when the [[Great Old One]] [[Mhar]] attempted to take advantage of the Storval Thinning, where the veil between Leng and [[Varisia]] is thin, to bore into the [[Material Plane]] before being trapped. Mhar's Fossa is filled with side branches leading to vaults and [[Demiplane|demiplanes]]. Nobody has dared exploring to its end, for fear that Mhar is still waiting.
