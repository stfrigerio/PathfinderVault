> Memorial Park canal-front district in [[Oppara]] has very few inhabitants. Over the years the empire turned this district into a memorial to heroes of [[Taldor]]. The [[Statue Garden of Porthmos]] along the canal, the Monument to the Armies of Exploration, the [[Memorial Arch of Prince Jalrune]], the [[Shining Obelisk]], the [[The Serpent Column|Serpent Column]], and many more smaller shrines to long-forgotten heroes of Old Taldor can be found here.
