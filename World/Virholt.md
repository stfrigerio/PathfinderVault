> **Virholt** was one of the original sixteen counties into which [[Kaldemov|King Kaldemov]] divided [[Ustalav]] in [[2862 AR]] in order to avoid a civil war among the feuding [[Varisian]] noble families.  A rugged land perched high in the [[Hungry Mountains]], it was sadly also one of the first conquests of the reborn [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] in [[3203 AR]].  During the centuries of his unnatural reign, it became a lifeless wilderness where no living thing could thrive.  This blight was not lifted with the Whispering Tyrant's defeat in [[38' AR]], and remains to the present day.  The victors of the [[Shining Crusade]] combined Virholt with its equally desolate neighbor [[Grodlych]], naming the territory [[Virlych]].  It remained a protectorate of the nation of [[World/Geography/Nations/Lastwall]] until that nation collapsed in [[4719 AR]], with frequent armed patrols who hunted down any undead that roamed the land near the Whispering Tyrant's prison, [[Gallowspire]].
