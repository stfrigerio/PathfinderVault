> The Greenbelt is a swath of land in the [[Stolen Lands]] of the [[River Kingdoms]]. It is positioned between the [[Kamelands]] to the east and the [[Hooktongue Slough]] to the west.



## Geography

> The Greenbelt consists of some of the rolling hills of the Kamelands and is dominated by a large woodland known as the [[Narlmarches]]. It is also criss-crossed by numerous major rivers that wind their way through the Stolen Lands. These include:

> - [[Gudrin River]]
> - [[Little Sellen River]]
> - Murque River
> - [[Shrike River]]
> - [[Skunk River River Kingdoms|Skunk River]]
> - Thorn River

## Inhabitants

> [[Fey]] are very common throughout the Greenbelt although somewhat less so in the northern areas, where [[Human|humans]] from [[Brevoy]] are more likely to frequent. Trappers favor the northern portions of the Greenbelt where fur from game such as deer, [[PathfinderWiki/Creatures/Fox|foxes]], and [[Mink|minks]] can fetch a fair price. The Greenbelt is relatively safe by the standards of the [[Stolen Lands]]; even so, threats such as [[Kobold|kobolds]], [[Mite|mites]] and bandits are a constant concern for travelers.


### Specific inhabitants

> - [[Bokken]], an eccentric [[Potion|potion]] maker and hermit has made his home here.
> - [[Oleg Leveton]] and his wife operate a trading post on the border of [[Rostland]].
