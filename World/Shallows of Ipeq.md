> The **Shallows of Ipeq** in the [[Brazen Frontier]] region of [[Osirion]] is one of only three ways of crossing the [[Crook River]] on foot. It is a placid, slow moving stretch of the river with water no more than five feet deep. The city of [[Ipeq]] standing on the southern bank of the river completely blocks the access to the shallows.
