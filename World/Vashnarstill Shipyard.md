> The **Vashnarstill Shipyard** is a centuries-old fixture of the [[Yolubilis Harbor]] area of [[Kintargo]]. Vashnarstill has remained the most reliable dockyard for over 10 generations due to its management. Ownership is handed down on the basis of merit rather than blood ties; each owner has tried to select the best employee to succeed him and, so far, this has worked. However, the current owner, Kohl Draksitus, faces stiff competition from new yards in the rival [[Cheliax|Chelish]] cites of [[Westcrown]] and [[Corentyn]].
