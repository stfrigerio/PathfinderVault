The **Unspeakable Word** is considered to be both the final page of the *[[Book of the Damned]]* and a massive heart-shaped organ within the book's [[Demiplane|demiplane]] that pumps [[Evil|evil]] thoughts and deeds from across the [[Multiverse|multiverse]] into the book's records. The organ, which measures about 30 feet across and 40 feet long, is chained to the center of the book's demiplane and defended by the [[Voice of the Damned]], an entity permanently bound to the plane.
