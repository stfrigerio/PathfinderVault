> The island of **Goroyasa** sits off of the southern west corner of the [[Valashmai Jungle]], as far away from the rest of [[Tian Xia]] and civilisation as it is possible to be. Like the rest of the Valashmai Jungle, Goroyasa is deeply hostile to outsiders but here it is because every single plant and animal shares a foul fungal infection that infests all life across the island. This fungal infection grants its bearers strange powers but in exchange saps them of their free will. The [[Slaves of Goroyasa]], as the [[Human|human]] inhabitants of the island are known, are devout followers of [[Cyth-V'sug|Cyth-Vsug]], [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of fungus and parasites, but how much influence Cyth-V'sug has over the island's fungal entity or even if he is aware of its existence is unknown.
