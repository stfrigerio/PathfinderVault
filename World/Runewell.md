> A ***runewell*** is a [[Magic|magical]] [[Artifact|artifact]] created by the ancient [[Runelords|runelords]] of [[Thassilon]]. Seven types of *runewell* were created, each attuned by its creator to one of the seven sins of Thassilonian [[Sin magic|sin magic]]: greed, sloth, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, and pride.
