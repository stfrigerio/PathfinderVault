> The **Odeber family** is a truly ancient house whose extended members are spread about [[Avistan]] and [[Garund]]. Their name is so old, in fact, that it has changed over time, adopting to the [[Language|languages]] and cultures where Odebers settled down. In northern Avistan they are known as **Debarr** and **Otarr**. In [[Galt]], they go by **Deboir**, while in [[Osirion]], **Andabar**. Whatever their names, Odebers throughout history have time and again distinguished themselves through their devout service to numerous [[Deity|gods]]. Although they have generally worshiped [[Good|good]] deities, in particular pledging themselves to the divine as [[Cleric|clerics]] and [[Paladin|paladins]], they have occasionally worshiped more [[Neutral|neutral]] ones as well, [[Pharasma]] in particular. Since the death of [[Aroden]], a few Odebers have begun to follow more secular pursuits and even worship [[Evil|evil]] gods, something which the rest of the family finds quite upsetting and in bad taste.


## Famous members

> The first recorded member of the family was Arn Odeber, whose son Saint Marcus Odeber was the first paladin of [[Shelyn]]. More recent examples are [[Ingrid Odeber]], the commander of the [[Diamond Regiment]] in [[Andoran|Andorans]] [[Darkmoon Vale]], and Sarkarus Odeber, a mid-level cleric of [[Asmodeus]] in the former [[Cheliax|Chelish]] capital of [[Westcrown]].
