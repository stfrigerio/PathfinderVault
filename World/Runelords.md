 [[Karzoug]], Runelord of Greed.
> The seven **runelords** of [[Thassilon]] each ruled their own realm in the centuries before [[Earthfall]]. Each runelord was a powerful [[Wizard|wizard]] tied to a particular aspect of [[Sin magic|sin magic]].



## Origin of the runelords

> Thassilon was founded in [[-6530 AR]] by [[Xin|First King Xin]] who had been exiled from his homeland of [[Azlant]] for promoting heretical beliefs. As the empire grew beyond the bounds of Xin's ability to control, both militarily and administratively, he appointed powerful wizards as governors to oversee his lands. The mightiest of these were the runelords, seven of the most skilled (and power-hungry) wizards in Thassilon, if not all of [[Golarion]]. In [[-6420 AR]], the runelords assassinated Xin and subjugated those loyal to him—including his own son, who became a puppet emperor—while each plotted within his or her own lands to become ruler of all Thassilon.
> The Virtues of Rule (generosity, love, humility, temperance, charity, kindness, and zeal), passed down from the goddess [[Lissala]] and First King Xin himself were seen as the benefits of power, and each of the runelords was drawn towards one of the seven. Over the course of time, the runelords corrupted these into what modern scholars understand to be the "great sins of the [[Soul|soul]]," abandoning the positive aspects of each and embracing the negative connotations of each (greed, lust, boastful pride, gluttony, envy, wrath, and sloth) as the rewards of rule. Each of the seven rulers specialized in a single school of rune magic and possessed a mighty weapon which not only served them in battle, but also became a symbol of their rule.


## The runelords of Thassilon

> The runelords forged alliances with [[Dragon|dragons]] and enslaved giants by using secrets of rune and glyph magic stolen from the alghollthus in their efforts to increase their own power. With their enslaved giant armies, the wizards of Thassilon built massive tombs, enormous magical constructs, and staggering monuments that survive today, mute testimonies of a mysterious age long past.

## The runelords' slumber

> Thassilon met its end when the [[Alghollthu|alghollthus]] called down [[Earthfall]] to destroy [[Azlant]]. As the end drew near, the seven runelords retreated into the depths of their greatest monuments, put themselves into stasis and tasked their minions to free them once the dangers have passed. Due to the sheer devastation of Earthfall, no one was left to waken them, and so the wizard kings of Thassilon slumbered for countless ages.


## In culture

> Thassilon, and the runelords' reign over it, left indelible marks across the [[Inner Sea region]]. The [[Shoanti]] quahs of [[Varisia]] all still tell stories about the runelords, but refer to them as a pantheon of gods called the [[Azghat]] who turned [[Evil|evil]] and needed to be destroyed. Thassilonian ruins across the region still contain [[Artifact|artifacts]], [[Magic item|magic items]], treasures, and creatures associated with or crafted by the runelords.
