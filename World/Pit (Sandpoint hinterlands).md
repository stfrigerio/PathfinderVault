*For another meaning of "Pit", please see [[Hell]].*
> The **Pit** is an infamous [[Darklands]]-like area in the [[Devil's Platter|Devils Platter]] southeast of [[Sandpoint]]. From the Platter, it can only be accessed via winding furrows or by flight. Caverns throughout the region connect to the Pit from below. This 100-foot-wide hole shares the appearance of a sinkhole, and ledges and rope ladders lead into the depths. 
> Numerous fell creatures inhabit the connected caverns, including [[Goblin|goblin]] tribes, [[Dero|dero]], [[Troglodyte|troglodytes]], and the [[Sandpoint devil]]. An ancient temple dedicated to [[Kabriri]] is located in the deepest parts.
