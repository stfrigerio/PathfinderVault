> As the first [[Pathfinder lodge]] built after the [[Grand Lodge]], **Nexus House** in [[Quantium]] was opened to learn and better understand how to gain entrance to the [[Spire of Nex]]. Three [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] known as [[Vash-vatom|vash-vatoms]] run this large lodge and assign agents to tasks far and wide. Many [[Pathfinder|Pathfinders]] come to this lodge for chance to write an entry in the *[[Pathfinder Chronicles]]* about their heroic deeds.
> The current vash-vatom is the gnome [[Sebnet Sanserkoht]].
