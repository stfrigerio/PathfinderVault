> The **Stainless Caress** is the home of [[Queen of the Night]] [[Ardad Lili]] and is located in [[Avernus]]. The End of Innocence rules her domain from here and gathers allies to invade [[Nirvana]] such as: fallen [[Angel|angels]], [[Erinyes|erinyes]], [[Gylou|gylous]], other female devils and even [[PetitionerThe damned|damned petitioners]]. It is named after what she offered [[Mortal|mortals]] in exchange for their allegiance. It was created many millennia after Ardad Lili's arrival in Hell, and the alliance between the Queens of the Night began here.
