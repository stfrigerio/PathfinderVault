> The **Moonbog** is the name of the nocturnal [[Abyssal realm]] of the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] [[Jezelda]]. A single [[Moon Moonbog|moon]] shines down from a [[Star|starry]] sky on a bleak landscape. The stars might actually be the eyes of favoured [[Wolf|wolf]] companions of the realm's mistress viewing events on the surface.
> The realm consists of endless moorlands, wetlands, bogs, fens, and marshy plains, and [[Hezrou|hezrou]] [[Demon|demons]] and [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiendishly]] affected [[Froghemoth|froghemoths]] stalk the wetlands. The hezrous fight the demon wolves of Jezelda for supremacy and rule over lairs. The most important areas are the hunting grounds of Jezelda on the moorlands, where [[Humanoid|humanoids]] from many worlds have been collected to form frightened villages that satisfy Jezelda's appetites for hunting and prey. [[Lycanthrope|Lycanthropes]] and [[PathfinderWiki/Classes/Antipaladin|antipaladins]] of Jezelda stage eternal hunts on the moors, and Jezelda's minions constantly work to keep them populated.
> The realm is directly connected to the [[River Styx]].
