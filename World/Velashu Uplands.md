> The **Velashu Uplands** are a hilly region of northwestern [[Varisia]] located between the [[Velashu River]] on the one side and the combined border of the [[Mierani Forest]] and the [[Calphiak Mountains]] on the other. They are home to the famous [[Horsemen of the Velashu Uplands|horsemen]] of the same name, considered to be the finest [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Horse|horse]] breeders in all of Varisia. The hills are also home to a large number of wild horses, whom these horse lords follow across the terrain.



## Paths through the Uplands

> An old [[Varisian human ethnicity|Varisian]] trade route exists through the Uplands. It begins at the [[Varisia|Varisian]] town of [[Roderic's Cove|Roderics Cove]] on the [[Varisian Gulf]], and bypasses the nefarious city of [[Riddleport]] before entering the Velashu Uplands. Here it is little more than a rarely used trail that follows the curving Velashu River before cutting through a pass in the [[Red Mountains]] and running past the abandoned settlement of [[Brinewall]] all the way up to the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]].


## Local Threats

> The horsemen of the Uplands are under constant threat from raiders of the [[Nolands]] to their north, even though these attacks are largely disorganized. Until he was killed by a band of adventurers in [[4707 AR]], the [[White dragon|white dragon]] [[Arkrhyst]], who dwelt in the [[Kodar Mountains]] to the east, attacked the Uplands with great frequency and ferocity.


## Ruins of Thassilon

> During the time of the [[Runelords|runelords]] of ancient [[Thassilon]], the Velashu Uplands were split between the territories of [[Bakrakhan]], the Domain of Wrath, and [[Cyrusian]], the Domain of Pride. The memorial tomb of [[Xin]], the first king of Thassilon, is located in the southeastern part of these hills, and is known as the Emerald Chambers.
> Another Thassilonian ruin in the area includes the Ironwood Watch, a military watch post and customs house built by the [[Elf|elves]] of the [[Mierani Forest]] for the Cyrusian government.
