> The **Harcatha Rebellion** was an uprising in [[3937 AR]] by the Harcatha [[Jadwiga]] against [[Irrisen]]'s then rulers, the Sascha Jadwiga. They rose up in response to the perceived injustices being inflicted upon the Harcatha by the Sascha.
> The rebellion failed, and many Harcatha were killed. Some 400 survivors, led by the sisters Helgas Harcatha and Vaenane Harcatha, fled to the [[Witchcaves]] in the hope of recruiting [[Darklands]] allies to help their cause. Nothing more was heard of them until [[4079 AR]], when an insane force of Jadwiga emerged from the caves and rampaged across the region until they were wiped out by Irrisen forces led by General Chernim Karina.
> The Witchcaves are infested with [[Qlippoth|qlippoth]]. Some of the rebels still survive, serving the fiends as breeding stock and subject to ongoing torture.
