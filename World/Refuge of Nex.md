Description: Demiplane refuge of Nex
---

> The **Refuge of Nex** was created by the archmage [[Nex (person)|Nex]] during his centuries-long war with his rival [[Wizard|wizard]] [[Geb (person)|Geb]]. Nex constructed it using a shard from his personal [[Demiplane|demiplane]] known as the [[Crux of Nex]].
> There is an entrance to the Refuge in the lower levels of the [[Bandeshar]], Nex's erstwhile palace in [[Quantium]]. Nex fled into the Refuge in [[576 AR]], and many more have followed him in the centuries since. No one has ever re-emerged. In [[4716 AR]], the Refuge's gates opened again, stoking rumours about Nex's imminent return.
