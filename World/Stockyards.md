> The **Stockyards** is [[Kaer Maga]]'s biggest and most well-known place to buy, sell, or rent beasts.  Located in the [[Varisia|Varisian]] city's public [[Downmarket]] district, it deals predominantly in [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Horse|horses]] and [[Aurochs|aurochs]] to serve as mounts or draft [[Animal|animals]].  These creatures are generally sold by (or stolen from) local [[Shoanti]] tribes of the [[Storval Plateau]]. The Stockyards occasionally does business in more exotic fauna, captured abroad or in the nearby [[Cinderlands]].  These include smaller animals, such as the [[Hyena|hyena]]-like [[Bush tiger|bush tigers]], canine kominkas, and [[Cinder wolf|cinder wolves]], generally sold as guard animals or pets, but also the occasional megafauna brought by [[Orc|orcs]] from the [[Hold of Belkzen]].  The latter are generally not allowed into the city unless under heavy restraints, for fear that they will break loose and wreak havoc.
