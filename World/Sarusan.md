The continent of Sarusan, with the [[Valashmai Sea]] separating it from [[Tian Xia]] to its north.
> 
The least-understood of [[Golarion|Golarions]] continents (and also its smallest), **Sarusan** is located in a trackless sea south of [[Tian Xia]]'s [[Valashmai peninsula]]. Far from the trade winds, all available information on Sarusan comes from ancient accounts, because no modern expedition has successfully returned after journeying there. According to these stories, Sarusan is completely alien from the modern world. It is said to be a diverse land, containing dense jungles, expansive plains, and harsh deserts.



## History

> According to legend, Sarusan and Tian Xia once formed a gigantic supercontinent, connected by a great land bridge. Long before the first [[Tian human ethnicity|Tian]] nations rose, the empire of [[Taumata]] was said to stretch from southern Tian Xia to Sarusan itself, but due to their hubris, the gods destroyed Taumata's people and the land they lived on. The archipelago of [[Minata]] is said to be the remnants of this land bridge. Uncannily smooth obelisks on Sarusan hint at the ancient [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]] empire having a foothold on the continent as well.


## Inhabitants

> Some believe that the [[Taumata]], the black-skinned humans of the reed boat culture of [[Minata]] are descended from [[Human|humans]] who once called Sarusan home. Unfortunately, all of this information comes secondhand, from an earlier age.


### Fauna

> Enormous mammals inhabit the continent, some of which have gone extinct elsewhere in Golarion and some of which are utterly unknown. Sarusan's fauna includes many marsupials (mammals who carry their young in pouches) such as the [[Thylacine|thylacine]].


## Supernatural dangers

> Contributing to Sarusan's dread reputation, those who venture near the continent mysteriously forget the details of the place shortly after departing.
