> **Grandbridge** is the largest and most central district of [[Oppara]], just north of the [[Westport]] and [[Eastport]] districts. Grandbridge is a mercantile district with a lot of warehouses, factories, shopping squares, open-air markets, currency exchanges, and import/export businesses. A large open square is located at the point where the district touches the [[Porthmos River]] and the [[Grand Bridge of the Empire]] is based. On most days, the square is filled with makeshift stalls, tables, and tents. This is the famous Gray Market of Oppara.
