 [[Kyra]] pulls [[Merisiel]] away from a strange portal.
> A **portal** is a gateway that directly links one location to another location, often by [[Magic|magical]] or supernatural means. Many portals connect locations across great physical distances, and more rarely across [[Plane|planes]].



## Interplanetary portals

> All of the worlds of [[Golarion|Golarions]] [[Solar system|solar system]], with the exception of [[Aucturn]], are linked by a network of incredibly ancient **interplanetary portals** that allow instant travel between them.
> Only a rare few know some of the secrets of operating them. However, in recent years portals have taken to spontaneously activating for short periods, apparently at random and for no known reason.
> The [[Lashunta|lashunta]] of [[Castrovel]] have some skill with portals, enabling them to maintain close links with the [[Planet|planet]] of [[Akiton]]. Akiton's [[Contemplatives of Ashok]] have also managed to gain somewhat sporadic control of a portal that leads to Golarion's [[Mwangi Expanse]], which is known to the [[Mwangi human ethnicity|Mwangi]] natives as the [[Doorway to the Red Star]].
> However, perhaps the most famous is the portal linking [[Iadara]] in [[Kyonin]] with [[El]] in [[Sovyrian]]. The [[Elf|elves]] of Golarion use the [[Sovyrian Stone]] to control the portal, which enabled many of them to flee to Sovyrian and escape the disaster of [[Earthfall]].


### Creation

> The creators of these portals are unknown—some speculate that the portals may be older than life in the solar system. There is a particularly unusual and incomprehensible portal on the remote planetoid of [[Apostae]] that might be a message or test left behind by its creators. If so, nobody has solved it.


### Other known portals

> The arches for which the [[River Kingdoms]] town of [[Sevenarches]] was named are said to have once served as portals to other worlds. Kyonin has shown great interest in reclaiming this ancient site, but so far the town's rulers have refused to allow elves to enter the town.
> Portals to the [[Dark Tapestry]] made of [[Abysium|abysium]] exist in Golarion's underground caves.


## Planar portals

> Portals can link planes to each other, allowing entities to travel between them as easily as walking through a passageway.


### Magically created

> Several [[Spell|spells]] can create planar portals of varying levels of stability.


#### *Gate*

***Main article: [[Gate]]***
> The most common method of creating short-lived planar portals is the *[[Gate|gate]]* spell, which creates — for only a few seconds at a time — a planar portal with a specific and precise destination.


#### Planar breaches

> A **planar breach**, or **planar rift**, is a tear or gap in the [[Planar substrate|fabric of the planes]], often coinciding with powerful magic, or the proximity or relative configuration between multiple planes. Unless held open by extraordinary means, they are typically small and close within a few hours.


#### Planar tears

 [[Demon|Demons]] emerge from the [[Worldwound]], a massive planar tear connecting the [[Material Plane]] to the [[Abyss]].
> A **planar tear** is a stable planar portal that maintains a specific position. The most commonly known planar tears connect the [[Material Plane]] to [[Outer Planes]] or the [[First World]], with perhaps the most renowned (and feared) of them being the [[Worldwound]] to the [[Abyss]].
> **Elemental nexuses** are planar tears formed by extreme concentrations of [[Elemental energy|elemental energy]], and lead to the corresponding [[Elemental Plane]] — for example, the heart of a [[Volcano|volcano]] might contain a nexus to the [[Plane of Fire]].


#### Soulgates

> A **soulgate**, or **planar braid**, connects two planes based on [[Alignment|alignment]]. For example, a soulgate on the Material Plane might connect to other [[Neutral|neutrally-aligned]] planes, such as the [[Astral Plane]]. They are much less prominent than other planar portals, and require specialized training or attunement to detect and open.


### Naturally occurring

> The most prominent natural planar portals lie at the centers of [[Astronomy|celestial objects]], namely [[Star|stars]] and [[Black hole|black holes]]. Each star hosts a portal to the [[Positive Energy Plane]] and serves as a channel for nascent [[Soul|souls]] entering the [[Material Plane]]. Conversely, each black hole hosts a portal to the [[Negative Energy Plane]], destroying or corrupting matter that passes near and through them.
> On Golarion, several locations are known to contain natural planar portals:
> - Naturally occurring portals to the [[Elemental Plane|Elemental Planes]], especially the [[Plane of Air|Planes of Air]] and [[Plane of Water|Water]], appear in the [[Boreal Expanse]].
> - The [[Cenotaph]], located in the [[Tusk Mountains]], contains a natural portal to the [[Negative Energy Plane]].


## In religion

> Several [[Deities|deities]] and divine entities represent portals.
> - [[Alseta]] is the [[God|goddess]] of doorways, portals, thresholds, and the transition from year to year. [[Elves]] also consider her the patron deity of [[Elf gate|elf gates]], though it is not part of her official portfolio.
> - [[Areshkagal]] is the [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of portals and riddles.

## Portal-like transportation

> Portals are sometimes confused with comparatively more modern [[Elf gate|elf gates]], which only allow travel between locations on the same world. A series of portal-like [[Teleportation|teleportation]] stones links the [[Stewards]]' citadels on [[Verces]].
> [[Teleportation]] effects, while instantaneous, are rarely as permanent, stable, or demarcated as true portals. However, stable interplanar transportation gateways can be achieved through magical means. For instance, powerful [[Spell|spells]] such as *greater create demiplane* and *[[Gate|gate]]* can create new magical passages between planes.
