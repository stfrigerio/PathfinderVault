This article covers a class that is relevant to the [[Pathfinder campaign setting]] only in the context of the first edition of the [[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game]].


*This article is for a [[Advanced Player's Guide First Edition|Advanced Players Guide First Edition]] class. For the 2e antipaladin (champion sub-class), see [[PathfinderWiki/Items/Wondrous Items/Champion]].*
> Where the [[Fighter|fighter]] represents the pinnacle of martial combat, and the [[Paladin|paladin]] blends martial skill with devotion to a righteous [[Deity|deity]], cause, or organization, the **antipaladin** seeks to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. They are villains who actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society, caring nothing for anyone or anything but themselves. They embody corruption, [[Disease|disease]], and cruelty.



## Origins

> Antipaladins are extraordinary individuals who embrace [[Evil|evil]], hate, and corruption to a degree few [[Mortal|mortals]] can match. They are either the product of a paladin who has fallen from grace, or else are trained from a young age to take up this mantle.


### Fallen paladins

> All paladins follow a strict moral and behavioral code dedicated to upholding the power of just rulers, while championing [[Good|good]] and honor, and protecting the weak. Those who willfully commit an evil act or who violate their code of conduct lose access to their [[Divine magic|divinely-granted]] powers, and must seek atonement, either through the appropriate spell or via another means, in order to regain them. Most do so, but there are a few who fully embrace the wicked path they have already begun, and turn their back on all they once held dear; only these corrupted individuals become antipaladins. They become the opposite of what they once were, consorting and drawing power from [[Bestiary/Fiend|fiends]], killing the innocent, and putting themselves and their desires before all else. This fall from grace is very rare, and many are lured or tricked into following it. Once the moral transformation is complete (often after a complex ritual that involves blood sacrifice), the new antipaladin finds that she has the same level of divine power she once held as a servant of good.


### Trained antipaladins

> Not all antipaladins achieve their position through conversion. Some are trained in the martial skills from a very young age, and are taught to embrace hatred and cruelty, generally through mistreatment and pain. They grow to become living examples of evil, to disavow compassion and loyalty, and spread their gospel through pain and suffering.


## Code of conduct

> An antipaladin is required to follow a debased moral code and risks the loss of all of his divine powers should he ever willingly commit a good act. This code requires him to consider his own needs before anyone else's, to take advantage of others when possible, to punish the right and the just, and the impose tyranny on the helpless. He is not allowed to ally with good creatures, unless it is to undermine them from within their ranks, but even that is extremely rare.
> If an antipaladin ceases to adhere to the causes of [[Chaos|chaos]] and evil, commits a truly selfless act, or otherwise violates his personal code of conduct, his blasphemous gifts cease to function. He may only regain his powers by having an  *atonement* [[Spell|spell]] cast on him, or otherwise regain the respect of his chosen cause. Even more rarely than paladins, antipaladins may shift entirely to the cause of good, gaining holy powers.

> Antipaladins worship dark [[Deity|deities]] in the same fashion that paladins worship deities of goodness, but this is no more a requirement of the antipaladin than of the paladin. Some evil [[Deity|gods]] known to attract antipaladins include:

> - [[Lamashtu]]
> - [[Norgorber]]
> - [[Rovagug]]
> - [[Urgathoa]]
> - [[Dahak]]
> - [[Zyphus]]
> [[Calistria]], [[Besmara]], [[Hanspur]], and [[Hei Feng]] are the only known non-evil deities whom antipaladins venerate, presumably because of their more destructive, vengeful, and anti-authoritarian tendencies.
> The following [[Demon lord|demon lord]] are known to recruit antipaladin followers: [[Angazhan]], [[Baphomet]], [[Deskari]], [[Jezelda]], [[Kostchtchie]], [[Mazmezz]], [[Mestama]], the [[Nightripper]], [[Nurgal]], [[Orcus]], [[Pazuzu]], [[Shax]], [[Sifkesh]], [[Treerazer]], and [[Xoveron]].
