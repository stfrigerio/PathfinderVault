 A [[Shory]] sky master of air.
> The **aeromancers** were the mighty [[Arcanist|arcanists]] of the [[Shory Empire]] who used their knowledge of the [[Magic|magical]] art of [[Aeromantic Infadibulum]] to lift [[Flying city|entire cities]] into the skies and keep them aloft. These cities, such as the fabled city of [[Kho]], eventually came crashing down to earth for unknown reasons around the -7th century [[Absalom Reckoning|AR]].
> The aeromancers are said to have based their magic on the theories of [[Jatembe|Old-Mage Jatembe]] and his [[PathfinderWiki/Ten Magic Warriors]], who had brought the light of civilization to [[Garund]] toward the end of the [[Age of Anguish]]. No one has been able to replicate the accomplishments of the aeromancers to this day.
