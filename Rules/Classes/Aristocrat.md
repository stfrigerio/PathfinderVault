> **Aristocrats** form the social elite of a nation, though they are not necessarily born into the nobility. They tend to focus on social skills and courtly intrigue, and some even master the arts of stealth to help further their decadent intrigues. The best example of the aristocrat is the decadent nobility of [[Taldor]] forever competing in endless intrigues and indulging in wild decadence much to the chagrin of their lower-class countrymen.
