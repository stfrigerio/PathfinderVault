> Whether secreted away in a smoky basement [[Laboratory|laboratory]] or gleefully experimenting in a well-respected school of [[Magic|magic]], the **alchemist** is often regarded as being just as unstable, unpredictable, and dangerous as the concoctions he brews. While some creators of [[Alchemical item|alchemical items]] content themselves with sedentary lives as merchants, providing tindertwigs and smokesticks, the true alchemist answers a deeper calling. Rather than cast magic like a spellcaster, the alchemist captures his own magic potential within liquids and [[Extract|extracts]] he creates, infusing his chemicals with virulent power to grant him impressive skill with [[Poison|poisons]], explosives, and all matter of self-transformative magic. These items are known as [[Extract|extracts]], [[Bomb|bombs]], and [[Mutagen|mutagens]]. The extracts available to an alchemist are governed by which [[Formula|formula]] he has written in his formula book, which acts in many ways as the alchemist's equivalent to a [[Wizard|wizards]] [[Spellbook|spellbook]].



## On Golarion

> Alchemists most frequently ply their trade in urban areas, where they can easily buy their components and have a larger market for their specialty goods. The desert nation of [[Thuvia]] in [[Garund]] is particularly known for its alchemists, and owes its entire economy to the discovery of the most famous alchemical substance in all [[Golarion]]: the *[[Sun orchid elixir|sun orchid elixir]]*. Alchemists find a home anywhere were experimentation and innovation are valued, such as the city-state of [[Alkenstar]], the [[Gnome|gnome]] city of [[Brastlewark]] in [[Cheliax]], [[Oenopion Fleshforges|fleshwarping pits]] of the city of [[Oenopion]] in [[Nex]], and north-eastern areas of [[Ustalav]] collectively called the [[Palatinates]]. Many alchemists join up with the [[Pathfinder Society]]'s Grand Archive.
> In [[Absalom]], cosmetic-creating alchemists join the Perfumers' Conglomerate, a guild of artisans.
> The Sparkforge Collective in [[Dongun Hold]] is always looking for smiths, alchemists, and [[Inventor|inventors]] to join their ranks.


## Races

> There are no restrictions on the race of an alchemist, but [[Elf|elf]], [[Goblin|goblin]], [[Halfling|halfling]], [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]], [[Grippli|grippli]], [[Kobold|kobold]], [[Ratfolk|ratfolk]], [[Android|android]], [[Aphorite|aphorite]], and [[Suli|suli]] [[Adventurer|adventurers]] often become alchemists.


## Religions

 [[Damiel]] Morgethai, an iconic [[Elven|elven]] alchemist.
> Scholarly characters like alchemists may recognize that religious devotions bring a connection to their community, a purpose in life, and maybe a route to a superior position of power. This awareness might bring them to the worship of a deity associated with the intellect, such as the god of magic, [[Nethys]]. Alternatively, they might enjoy established and influential churches, such as those of [[Abadar]], [[Iomedae]], or [[Asmodeus]], depending on their personal calling.
> One of [[Norgorber]]'s aspects, Blackfingers, is an ally of alchemists and poisoners, and is respected even by [[Good|good]] alchemists for the forbidden knowledge he possesses. His followers often conduct reckless and immoral experiments.
> [[Ydersius]] is a god of the [[Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]], immortality, and poison. Alchemists value Ydersius's ancient lore regarding potent poisons, and the secrets of his threefold venoms are traded among certain sinister circles.
> Some other [[Deity|gods]] and [[Demigod|demigods]] take an interest in alchemy, including:

> - [[Cixyron]] is a [[Harbinger|daemonic harbinger]] of gunpowder and poisonous [[Metal|metals]] amongst other things
> - [[Haagenti]], [[Demon lord|demon lord]] of alchemy whose [[Abyssal realm]] is [[Cerebulim]], the Hermetic Horizon: an alchemical [[Clockwork|clockwork]] realm of [[Laboratory|laboratories]]
> - [[Jubilex]], demon lord of poison
> - The [[Great Old One]] [[Orgesh]] has alchemy within his portfolio
> - [[Scarmiglione]] is the [[Malebranche]] of poison
> - [[Vorasha]] is a daemonic harbinger of poison and toxicity
