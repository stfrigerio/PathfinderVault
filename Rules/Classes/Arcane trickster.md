> **Arcane tricksters** seek to meld the arts of thievery and subterfuge with the [[Arcane|arcane]]. Able to manipulate objects, disarm traps, and pick locks and pockets from a distance, arcane tricksters focus on the less conspicuous elements of [[Magic|magic]] to enhance their often less-than-legal pursuits, and stymie foes more through humiliation than domination. Many arcane tricksters are also [[Rogue|rogues]], [[Bard's End|bards]], or [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]], though a few [[Wizard|wizardry]] scoundrels have also assumed the trickster's mantle. Particularly talented arcane tricksters are known to cast spells more suddenly and silently than their traditional counterparts, and can even turn invisible in the blink of an eye.
