> **Adepts** are [[Spellcaster|spellcasters]] who can channel [[Divine|divine]] powers. Despite drawing their power from the same sources, adepts are not as powerful as either [[Cleric|clerics]] or [[Rules/Classes/Druid|druids]], and even the most powerful adept has access to [[Spell|spells]] of only middling power. They can, however, summon [[Familiar|familiars]] in a manner similar to [[Wizard|wizards]].
