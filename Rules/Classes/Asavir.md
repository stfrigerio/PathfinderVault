> The signature [[Fighting style|fighting style]] of the [[Al-Zabriti]] is embodied by **asavirs**, leaders of the tribes' defenders, who have close relationships with [[Nethys/Animals and Gears/Horse|horses]] from the tribe's [[Genie|genie]]-blessed stocks. They are famously adept at building loyal and coordinated teams of combatants and using their mounted prowess to break enemy lines and challenge their leaders.
> Asavirs are not limited to [[Al-Zabrit]]; some travel as [[Adventurer|adventurers]] or soldiers-for-hire, and others serve in other parts of [[Kelesh]], such as in its Imperial Forces.
> An asavir's mount—always an equine creature—is their [[Animal companion|animal companion]] and integral to their combat style and abilities. Asavirs are expert chargers, and their mounts can cause the ground to quake beneath them as they thunder forward. As the asavir grows in skill, their mount grows in power alongside them through blessings from [[Shaitan|shaitans]], [[Djinni|djinn]], [[Marid|marids]], [[Efreeti|efreet]], and ultimately [[Janni|jann]]. These blessings bestow powers of resilience, speed, agility, flaming hooves, and uncanny luck.
