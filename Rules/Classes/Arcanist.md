***A note on use:** The term "arcanist" can refer to this specific arcane spellcasting class, but can also more loosely refer to any arcane spellcaster, such as a [[Wizard|wizard]] or [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]].*
> Rather than focus on the innate abilities of their [[Bloodline|bloodlines]] or the research and study of the [[Arcane magic|arcane magic]], **arcanists** use their unique insight into the workings of [[Magic|magic]] to apply both approaches at once. Their distinct views on magic, extensive knowledge, and tremendous potential often leads them down reckless paths in pursuit of greater powers. Like a wizard, arcanists may call a [[Familiar|familiar]].
