> A **crimson templar** is a devout warrior who follows the [[Empyreal lord|empyreal lord]] [[Ragathiel]], and trains specifically in battling the forces of [[Hell]].
> Among the most [[Lawful good|lawful and goodly]] followers of Ragathiel are his crimson templars, ruthless assassins who are willing to kill in the name of good while saving others from having to perform such violent tasks. Their intense affiliation fortifies them against flames while also empowering them with heavenly fire, and can grant them five-winged flight similar to their patron's.
> Crimson templars wield [[Bastard sword|bastard swords]] with lethal power. Templars who stray from either strict lawfulness or pure goodness, or who kill a goodly creature, lose their patron's favor until they atone for their sins.
