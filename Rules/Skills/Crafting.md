You can use this skill to create, understand, and repair items.
Even if youâ€™re untrained, you can [[Recall Knowledge]].
Recall Knowledge about alchemical reactions, the value of items, engineering, unusual materials, and alchemical or mechanical creatures. The GM determines which creatures this applies to, but it usually includes constructs.
