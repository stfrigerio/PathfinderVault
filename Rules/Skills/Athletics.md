## Athletics (Str)

[[Athletics]] allows you to perform deeds of physical prowess. When you use the Escape basic action, you can use your [[Athletics]] modifier instead of your unarmed attack modifier.

![[Climb]]

This table provides a quick reference for how far you can move with a Climb or Swim action.

| Climb Distance | Swim Distance | Speed | Success | Critical Success | Critical |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----- | ------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| 5–15 feet      | 5             | 5     | 5       | 10               |          |
| 20–35 feet     | 5             | 10    | 10      | 15               |          |
| 40–55 feet     | 10            | 15    | 15      | 20               |          |
| 60–65 feet     | 15            | 20    | 20      | 25               |          |

#### Leap
The Leap basic action is used for High Jump and Long Jump. Leap lets you take a careful, short jump. You can Leap up to 10 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least 15 feet, or up to 15 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least 30 feet. You land in the space where your Leap ends (meaning you can typically clear a 5-foot gap if your Speed is between 15 feet and 30 feet, or a 10-foot gap if your Speed is 30 feet or more). If you make a vertical Leap, you can move up to 3 feet vertically and 5 feet horizontally onto an elevated surface.

#### Falling
When you fall more than 5 feet, you take falling damage when you land, which is bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance you fell. If you take any damage from a fall, you’re knocked prone when you land.
If you fall into water, snow, or another soft substance, calculate the damage from the fall as though your fall were 20 feet shorter. The reduction can’t be greater than the depth of the water (so when falling into water that is only 10 feet deep, you treat the fall as 10 feet shorter).
You can Grab an Edge as a reaction to reduce or eliminate the damage from some falls.

You try to knock an opponent to the ground. Attempt an [[Athletics]] check against the target’s [[Reflex]] DC.
- **Critical Success** The target falls and lands prone and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
- **Success** The target falls and lands prone.
- **Critical Failure** You lose your balance and fall and land prone.
