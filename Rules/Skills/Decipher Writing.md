### Decipher Writing (Trained)

When you encounter particularly archaic or esoteric texts, the GM might require you to Decipher the Writing before you can understand it. You must be trained in the relevant skill to Decipher Writing. [[Arcana]] is typically used for writing about magic or science, [[Occultism]] for esoteric texts about mysteries and philosophy, [[Religion]] for scripture, and [[Society]] for coded messages or archaic documents.

#### Decipher Writing
[[Concentrate]] [[Exploration]] [[Secret]]
You attempt to decipher complicated writing or literature on an obscure topic. This usually takes 1 minute per page of text, but might take longer (typically an hour per page for decrypting ciphers or the like). The text must be in a language you can read, though the GM might allow you to attempt to decipher text written in an unfamiliar language using [[Society]] instead.
The DC is determined by the GM based on the state or complexity of the document. The GM might have you roll one check for a short text or a check for each section of a larger text.
- **Critical Success** You understand the true meaning of the text.
- **Success** You understand the true meaning of the text. If it was a coded document, you know the general meaning but might not have a word-for-word translation.
- **Failure** You can’t understand the text and take a –2 circumstance penalty to further checks to decipher it.
- **Critical Failure** You believe you understand the text on that page, but you have in fact misconstrued its message.


#### Sample Decipher Writing Tasks
- **Trained** entry-level philosophy treatise
- **Expert** complex code, such as a cipher
- **Master** spymaster’s code or advanced research notes
- **Legendary** esoteric planar text written in metaphor by an ancient celestial.



#### Extra Preparation
When Earning Income, you might be able to spend days of downtime to prepare for your task, which adjusts the DC of the skill check. This might involve rehearsing a play, studying a topic, and so on. The GM determines how long preparation takes and how much the DC changes. This is most useful when you’re trying a task that’s higher level than you; otherwise such tasks have an increased DC!

#### Ending or Interrupting Tasks
When a task you’re doing is complete, or if you stop in the middle of one, you normally have to find a new task if you want to keep Earning Income. For instance, if you quit your job working at the docks, you’ll need to find another place of employment instead of picking up where you left off. This usually takes 1 day or more of downtime looking for leads on new jobs.
However, you might pause a task due to an adventure or event that wouldn’t prevent you from returning to the old job later. The GM might decide that you can pick up where you left off, assuming the task hasn’t been completed by others in your absence. Whether you roll a new skill check when you resume is also up to the GM. Generally speaking, if you had a good initial roll and want to keep it, you can, but if you had a bad initial roll, you can’t try for a better one by pausing to do something else. If your statistics changed during the break—usually because you leveled up while adventuring—you can attempt a new check.
