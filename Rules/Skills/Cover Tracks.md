#### Cover Tracks
[[Concentrate]] [[Exploration]] [[Move]]
You cover your tracks, moving up to half your travel Speed). You don’t need to attempt a [[Survival]] check to cover your tracks, but anyone tracking you must succeed at a [[Survival]] check against your [[Survival]] DC if it is higher than the normal DC to Track.
In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an encounter. In this case, Cover Tracks is a single action and doesn’t have the exploration trait.
