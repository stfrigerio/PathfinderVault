## Lore (Int)

You have specialized information on a narrow topic.
Lore features many subcategories. You might have Military [[Lore]], Sailing [[Lore]], Vampire [[Lore]], or any similar subcategory of the skill. Each subcategory counts as its own skill, so applying a skill increase to Planar [[Lore]] wouldn’t increase your proficiency with Sailing [[Lore]], for example.
You gain a specific subcategory of the [[Lore]] skill from your background. The GM determines what other subcategories they’ll allow as [[Lore]] skills, though these categories are always less broad than any of the other skills that allow you to [[Recall Knowledge]], and they should never be able to fully or mainly take the place of another skill’s [[Recall Knowledge]] action. For instance, Magic [[Lore]] wouldn’t enable you to recall the same breadth of knowledge covered by [[Arcana]], Adventuring [[Lore]] wouldn’t simply give you all the information an adventurer needs, and Planar [[Lore]] would not be sufficient to gain all the information spread across various skills and subcategories such as Heaven [[Lore]].
If you have multiple subcategories of [[Lore]] that could apply to a check or that would overlap with another skill in the circumstances, you can use the skill with the better skill modifier or the one you would prefer to use. If there’s any doubt whether a [[Lore]] skill applies to a specific topic or action, the GM decides whether it can be used or not.
Even if you’re untrained in [[Lore]], you can use it to [[Recall Knowledge]].
Recall Knowledge about the subject of your [[Lore]] skill’s subcategory.
