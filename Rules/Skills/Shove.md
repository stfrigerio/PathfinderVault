#### Shove *⬻{ .Pathfinder }*
[[Attack]]
**Requirements** You have at least one hand free. The target can’t be more than one size larger than you.
You push an opponent away from you. Attempt an [[Athletics]] check against your opponent’s [[Fortitude]] DC.
- **Critical Success** You push your opponent up to 10 feet away from you. You can Stride after it, but you must move the same distance and in the same direction.
- **Success** You push your opponent back 5 feet. You can Stride after it, but you must move the same distance and in the same direction.
- **Critical Failure** You lose your balance, fall, and land prone.

#### Forced Movement
The Shove action can force a creature to move. When an effect forces you to move, or if you start falling, the distance you move is defined by the effect that moved you, not by your Speed. Because you’re not acting to move, this doesn’t trigger reactions triggered by movement.
