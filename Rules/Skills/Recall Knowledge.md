### Recall Knowledge (Untrained)

To remember useful information on a topic, you can attempt to [[Recall Knowledge]]. You might know basic information about something without needing to attempt a check, but [[Recall Knowledge]] requires you to stop and think for a moment so you can recollect more specific facts and apply them. You might even need to spend time investigating first. For instance, to use [[Medicine]] to learn the cause of death, you might need to conduct a forensic examination before attempting to [[Recall Knowledge]].

#### Recall Knowledge *⬻{ .Pathfinder }*
[[Concentrate]] [[Secret]]
You attempt a skill check to try to remember a bit of knowledge regarding a topic related to that skill. The GM determines the DCs for such checks and which skills apply.
**Critical Success** You recall the knowledge accurately and gain additional information or context.
**Success** You recall the knowledge accurately or gain a useful clue about your current situation.
**Critical Failure** You recall incorrect information or gain an erroneous or misleading clue.
The following skills can be used to [[Recall Knowledge]], getting information about the listed topics. In some cases, you can get the GM’s permission to use a different but related skill, usually against a higher DC than normal. Some topics might appear on multiple lists, but the skills could give different information. For example, [[Arcana]] might tell you about the magical defenses of a golem, whereas [[Crafting]] could tell you about its sturdy resistance to physical attacks.
- **Arcana**: Arcane theories, magical traditions, creatures of arcane significance, and arcane planes.
- **Crafting**: Alchemical reactions and creatures, item value, engineering, unusual materials, and constructs.
- **Lore**: The subject of the Lore skill’s subcategory.
- **Medicine**: Diseases, poisons, wounds, and forensics.
- **Nature**: The environment, flora, geography, weather, creatures of natural origin, and natural planes.
- **Occultism**: Ancient mysteries, obscure philosophy, creatures of occult significance, and esoteric planes.
- **Religion**: Divine agents, divine planes, theology, obscure myths, and creatures of religious significance.
- **Society**: Local history, key personalities, legal institutions, societal structure, and humanoid culture.
The GM might allow checks to [[Recall Knowledge]] using other skills. For example, you might assess the skill of an acrobat using [[Acrobatics]]. If you’re using a physical skill (like in this example), the GM will most likely have you use a mental ability score—typically [[Intelligence]] — instead of the skill’s normal physical ability score.
