#### Disable A Device *⬺{ .Pathfinder }*
[[Manipulate]]
**Requirements** Some devices require you to use thieves’ tools when disabling them.
This action allows you to disarm a trap or another complex device. Often, a device requires numerous successes before becoming disabled, depending on its construction and complexity. Thieves’ tools are helpful and sometimes even required to Disable a Device, as determined by the GM, and sometimes a device requires a higher proficiency rank in Thievery to disable it.
Your [[Thievery]] check result determines how much progress you make.
- **Critical Success** You disable the device, or you achieve two successes toward disabling a complex device. You leave no trace of your tampering, and you can rearm the device later, if that type of device can be rearmed.
- **Success** You disable the device, or you achieve one success toward disabling a complex device.
- **Critical Failure** You trigger the device.
