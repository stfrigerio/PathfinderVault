#### Demoralize *⬻{ .Pathfinder }*
[[Auditory]] [[Concentrate]] [[Emotion]] [[Mental]]
With a sudden shout, a well-timed taunt, or a cutting put-down, you can shake an enemy’s resolve. Choose a creature within 30 feet of you who you’re aware of. Attempt an [[Intimidation]] check against that target’s Will DC. If the target does not understand the language you are speaking, you’re not speaking a language, or they can’t hear you, you take a –4 circumstance penalty to the check. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your attempts to [[Demoralize]] it for 10 minutes.
