#### Make an Impression
[[Auditory]] [[Concentrate]] [[Exploration]] [[Linguistic]] [[Mental]]
With at least 1 minute of conversation, during which you engage in charismatic overtures, flattery, and other acts of goodwill, you seek to make a good impression on someone to make them temporarily agreeable. At the end of the conversation, attempt a [[Diplomacy]] check against the Will DC of one target, modified by any circumstances the GM sees fit. Good impressions (or bad impressions, on a critical failure) last for only the current social interaction unless the GM decides otherwise.
- **Critical Success** The target’s attitude toward you improves by two steps.
- **Success** The target’s attitude toward you improves by one step.
- **Critical Failure** The target’s attitude toward you decreases by one step.
