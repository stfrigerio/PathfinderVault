# Bounty Hunter Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[[Archetype]]  [[dedication]]  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [[Survival]]

When focused on finding your quarry, you're relentless. You gain the [[Hunt Prey]] action. You can use [[Hunt Prey]] to designate only a creature that you've seen, heard about, or learned about through some other means, such as a bounty board or wanted poster. In addition to the other benefits of [[Hunt Prey]], you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Gather Information]] regarding your prey.

If you already have [[Hunt Prey]], you become an expert in [[Survival]] and gain the circumstance bonus to [[Gather Information]] about your prey; you can still designate a creature you're tracking during exploration, in addition to the conditions above.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the bounty hunter archetype.

# Posse  *Feat 4*  
[[Archetype]]  [[exploration]]  

- **Requirements**: You have designated prey with [[Hunt Prey]].

By spending 1 minute giving guidance to help hunt down your prey, you instruct up to five willing creatures to assist you. They gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Seek]] your prey, to [[Track]] your prey, and to [[Gather Information]] about your prey. You and the creatures assisting you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls when entering combat with your prey.

This benefit lasts until you designate a new prey or your prey dies, whichever comes first. An individual creature assisting you loses this benefit if they're out of your presence for too long to benefit from your instructions. This is usually 1 hour, but is determined by the GM.
