# Bullet Dancer *Dedication Level 2*  
[[uncommon]]  

While most monastic orders and traditional fighting schools shun firearms as loud and unreliable technology for unskilled conscripts, you fuse flourishing feints and ricocheting gunplay into a whirling ballet of bullets. As a bullet dancer, you might become the target of brash duelists and gladiators looking to make a name for themselves. But you tend to welcome the attention and might have proven your reputation while dancing your deadly ballet in tournaments from Tymon to Goka. You've found your fluid motions and explosive attacks to be surefire crowd-pleasers, even as they serve to confound and shock your foes.

# Bullet Dancer Burn  *Feat 6*  
[[Archetype]]  

- **Prerequisites**: Bullet Dancer Stance
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a firearm with an attached [[bayonet]] or [[reinforced stock]].

The fiery blaze of your weapons combined with your unorthodox technique leaves your opponents with little opportunity to capitalize on any gaps in your defenses, or properly defend themselves against your onslaught. While in Bullet Dancer Stance, when you successfully [[Strike]] an opponent with a bayonet or reinforced stock attached to your firearm, the next ranged [[Strike]] you make against that opponent doesn't trigger reactions that would trigger on a ranged attack, such as [[Attack of Opportunity]]. While in Bullet Dancer Stance, when you make a successful ranged [[Strike]] against an opponent within your melee reach using a firearm, the next reinforced stock or bayonet attack attached to that firearm deals an additional 1 fire damage per weapon damage die.

The benefit on your next [[Strike]] from either use of Bullet Dancer Burn is lost if not used by the end of your next turn.

You've learned to react with ranged weapons when a creature is in close quarters.

- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded crossbow or firearm.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You shoot not at your foe but at an object nearby. Make a [[Strike]] with your firearm against an AC equal to an easy DC for your level . On a success, instead of hitting your foe, your attack hits an object behind or to the side of your target, creating one of the following effects. The GM might determine that a different AC is appropriate or that a particular effect isn't a valid option, such as using the explosive barrel option when there's no such object on the battlefield. The GM should inform you if a Trick Shot is feasible before you spend your actions, since your trained eye can easily recognize loose or volatile objects.

- **Dislodge Object** Your attack knocks an unattended object of no more than 2 Bulk out of position, moving it up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice. For example, the weapon could knock a wizard's crystal ball off a table.
- **Explosive Barrel** Your attack strikes a barrel of expensive rum, a vial of volatile alchemical fluids, a demonic pustule erupting from the earth, or some other explosive object. The object explodes in a 20-foot burst, and creatures in the area take `6d6` damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The damage type is chosen by the GM, based on the exploding object. Increase the damage by `1d6` for every 2 levels you have above 10th.
