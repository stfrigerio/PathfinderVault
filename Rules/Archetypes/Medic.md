You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you have [[Legendary Medic]]; even if you do, the counteract DC increases by 10. Treating a Condition that is continually applied under certain circumstances  condition a good character gains from carrying an [[unholy weapon]]) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.
