[[Archetype]]  [[dedication]]  [[uncommon]]  

- **Access**: You are from the Golden Road region.
- **Prerequisites**: Ancient Osiriani and Sphinx languages, trained in [[Crafting]]

You've begun to inscribe a magical stone called a ka stone that you will some day tie to your soul. You gain knowledge of Ancient Osirion and a connection to your nascent ka stone. If you fail a recovery check while [[dying]], your [[dying]] condition does not increase; if you critically fail, your [[dying]] condition increases by only 1. You become trained in [[Ancient Osirion Lore]], or expert if you were already trained.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the living monolith archetype.

[[Archetype]]  [[rare]]

You inscribe your true name on your ka stone, as well as oaths to gods and pharaohs, and embed it in your forehead in a special ritual with a sphinx or with a living monolith who already has this feat.

It can't be removed without your permission, nor can it be dispelled, and you can never lose investiture in the ka stone. Its Bulk is negligible.

The ka stone grants you a +1 item bonus to saves against [[death]] effects and [[negative]] effects, which increases to +2 at 8th level, +3 at 14th level, and +4 at 20th level.
