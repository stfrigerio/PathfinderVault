While the nation of Lastwall is gone, leaving only the horror of the Gravelands behind, you refuse to give up and renounce your oaths. You've renewed your vows, swearing to combat the influence of the Whispering Tyrant wherever it might strike across Golarion.

# Grave Sense  *Feat 6*  
[[Archetype]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Lastwall Sentry Dedication]]

Your time spent hunting the undead allows you to sense them.

You sense undead as a vague sense  similar to a human's sense of smell, an uncomfortable sensation akin to smelling something cloying and rotting. When in proximity to the undead, you eventually sense their presence, though you might not do so instantly, and you can't pinpoint their location. An undead using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence must attempt a [[Deception]] check against your [[Perception]] DC to hide its presence from you. If the creature succeeds at its [[Deception]] check, it is then temporarily immune to your Grave Sense for 1 day.

# Necromantic Tenacity  *Feat 8*  
[[Archetype]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Necromantic Resistance]]

Your training against necromantic effects allows you to escape the worst of their touch. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a [[necromancy]] effect, you get a critical success instead; if you roll a critical failure on such a save, you get a failure instead.

# Lastwall Warden  *Feat 10*  
[[Archetype]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Lastwall Sentry Dedication]]

You use your shield to protect your allies, not just yourself, especially against the undead. When you have a shield raised, you can use your [[Shield Block]] reaction when an attack is made against an ally adjacent to you, in addition to its usual trigger. If you do, the shield prevents that ally from taking damage instead of you, following the normal rules for a [[Shield Block]].

If an undead makes an attack against an ally within 10 feet, you can [[Step]] to become adjacent to your ally and then use [[Shield Block]] as part of the same reaction.
