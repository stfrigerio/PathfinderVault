# Trick Driver *Dedication Level 2*  
[[uncommon]]  

While cavaliers follow an old and tired tradition of mounted combat, you take a more modern road. Through aggressive use of vehicles, you roll across the battlefield, taking down your opponents. You go beyond simply operating a vehicle, pushing it to perform stunts that its builders never intended, transforming the vehicle into something much greater than a mere conveyance.

# Trick Driver Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[[Archetype]]  [[dedication]]  [[uncommon]]  


You are equally at home piloting any vehicle, adapting yourself instantly to varied controls, movements, and handling.

Whenever piloting a vehicle requires a [[Piloting Lore]] or [[Sailing Lore]] check, you can use your [[Driving Lore]] proficiency instead.

You can use Dexterity in place of Intelligence when attempting piloting checks with [[Driving Lore]]. You become an expert in [[Driving Lore]]. At 7th level, you become a master in [[Driving Lore]], and at 15th level, you become legendary in [[Driving Lore]].

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the trick driver archetype.

# Express Driver  *Feat 2*  
[[Archetype]]  [[exploration]]  [[skill]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Trick Driver Dedication]]

You can optimize your vehicle's performance, coaxing extra speed and choosing paths to avoid slowdowns.

When calculating your travel speed for the day while piloting a vehicle, you can attempt a [[Driving Lore]] check to increase your vehicle's travel speed. The DC is determined by the GM but is typically based on the vehicle's piloting DC or a difficulty based on the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, increase your vehicle's travel speed by half. This has no effect on your vehicle's movement in encounters.
