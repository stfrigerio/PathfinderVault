# Alkenstar Agent Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[[Archetype]]  [[dedication]]  [[uncommon]]  

- **Access**: You have been initiated by the grand duchess of Alkenstar or one of her agents.
- **Prerequisites**: trained in [[Deception]] and at least one firearm

You put on the persona of a rough and tumble outlaw, but your real goals are to report threats to Alkenstar back to the grand duchess. You become an expert in [[Deception]] and trained in your choice of [[Underworld Lore]] or [[Legal Lore]]; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You gain the [[Lie to Me]] skill feat.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the Alkenstar Agent archetype.

You've learned to react with ranged weapons when a creature is in close quarters. You can use a reaction that normally allows you to make a melee weapon [[Strike]] to instead make a ranged weapon [[Strike]]. You must be Striking an adjacent target. If necessary for the reaction's trigger, you treat your ranged weapon as if it had a reach of 5 feet. If the reaction has other requirements, such as wielding a specific kind of weapon, Snap Shot doesn't allow you to ignore them; it allows you only to replace a melee weapon [[Strike]] with a ranged weapon [[Strike]].
