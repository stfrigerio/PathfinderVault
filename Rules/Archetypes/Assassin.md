# Assassin *Dedication Level 2*  

Targeted killing through stealth and subterfuge is the expertise of an assassin. While assassins are skilled in ending lives and many are evil, some live by a moral code, preying on the wicked, the cruel, or those who revel in unchecked aggression or power.

Your [[agile]] and [[finesse]] weapons and unarmed attacks gain the [[backstabber]] and [[deadly <d6>]] weapon traits when you're attacking your mark.
