# Dual Thrower  *Feat 4*  
[[Archetype]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication]]

You know how to throw two weapons as easily as strike with them. Whenever a dual-weapon warrior feat allows you to make a melee [[Strike]], you can instead make a ranged [[Strike]] with a thrown weapon or a one-handed ranged weapon you are wielding. Any effects from these feats that apply to one-handed melee weapons or melee [[Strikes]] also apply to one-handed ranged weapons and ranged [[Strikes]].

- **Prerequisites**: Dual-Weapon Dedication

When you lash out with both weapons, you leave no room for the target to escape your attack. When you use [[Double Slice]], if you miss with both [[Strikes]], choose one of the two weapons and apply the effects of a hit with that weapon. You can't choose a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was a critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if both attack rolls were critical failures.
