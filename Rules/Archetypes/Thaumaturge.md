# Thaumaturge *Dedication Level 2*  

Scraps of knowledge have taught you how to exploit the vulnerabilities of creatures and the powers of mystical objects.

## Multiclass Thaumaturge Characters
<sup>DA p. 49</sup>

Thaumaturge suits characters who want to glean strange knowledge. It's especially useful for those who tend to fight with one-handed weapons, like swashbucklers or rogues, since they have their other hand free for an implement.
