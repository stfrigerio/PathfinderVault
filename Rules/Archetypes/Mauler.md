# Mauler Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[[Archetype]]  [[dedication]]  

- **Prerequisites**: Strength 14

You specialize in weapons that require two hands. You become trained in all simple and martial melee weapons that require two hands to wield or have the [[two-hand]] trait. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank in these weapons. If you are at least an expert in such a weapon, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with that weapon.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the mauler archetype.

# Knockdown  *⬺{ .Pathfinder }* *Feat 4*  
[[fighter]]  [[flourish]]  

> [!pf2-note] This version of [[Knockdown]] is intended for use with the Mauler Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [[Athletics]]
- **Activity** Two-Action

You make an attack to knock a foe off balance, then follow up immediately with a sweep to topple them. Make a melee [[Strike]]. If it hits and deals damage, you can attempt an [[Athletics]] check to [[Trip]] the creature you hit. If you're wielding a two-handed melee weapon, you can ignore [[Trip]]'s requirement that you have a hand free. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both of them.

> [!pf2-note] This version of [[Power Attack]] is intended for use with the Mauler Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Activity** Two-Action

You unleash a particularly powerful attack that clobbers your foe but leaves you a bit unsteady. Make a melee [[Strike]]. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If this [[Strike]] hits, you deal an extra die of weapon damage. If you're at least 10th level, increase this to two extra dice, and if you're at least 18th level, increase it to three extra dice.

[[Archetype]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Mauler Dedication]]
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a melee weapon in two hands.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You put your body behind your massive weapon and swing, shoving enemies to clear a wide path. You attempt to [[Shove]] up to five creatures adjacent to you, rolling a separate [[Athletics]] check for each target. Then [[Stride]] up to half your Speed. This movement doesn't trigger reactions from any of the creatures you successfully Shoved.

> [!pf2-note] This version of [[Improved Knockdown]] is intended for use with the Mauler Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Prerequisites**: [[Knockdown]]

You can dash your foe to the ground with a single blow. When you use Knockdown, instead of making a [[Strike]] followed by a [[Trip]], you can attempt a single [[Strike]]. If you do and your [[Strike]] hits, instead of rolling a check for your [[Trip]] attempt, you also apply the critical success effect of a [[Trip]]. If you used a two-handed melee weapon for the [[Strike]], you can use the weapon's damage die size instead of the regular die size for the damage from a critical [[Trip]].

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a melee weapon in two hands.
- **Activity** Single Action

Your final blow can make an impact even if it rebounds off a foe's defenses. Make a [[Strike]] with the required weapon. After the [[Strike]], your turn ends. The [[Strike]] deals one extra weapon damage die, or two extra weapon damage dice if you're at least 18th level. The [[Strike]] also gains the following failure effect.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Failure** You deal damage equal to one weapon damage die of the required weapon. Increase this to two dice if you're at least 18th level.

- **Prerequisites**: [[Mauler Dedication]]

- **Activity** Three-Action

You smash the ground with your weapon, knocking nearby creatures to the ground. Choose a square within your reach, including your own space. If there's a foe in the chosen square, [[Strike]] that foe with the required weapon.

Then attempt to [[Trip]] every foe in the chosen square plus each square adjacent to that square, ignoring [[Trip]]'s requirement that you have a hand free. This counts as three attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made the [[Strike]], if any, and all the [[Trip]] attempts.

Whichever of the two options you choose, roll a separate [[Athletics]] check against each foe, performing the same action against each foe. Each attempt counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you have made all the attempts.
