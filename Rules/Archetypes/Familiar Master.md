# Familiar Master *Dedication Level 2*  

From the wise owl perched on the wizard's shoulder to the crafty gremlin that serves the witch for their own reasons, the ghastly homunculus in the alchemist's lab to the clever monkey that picks the lock of the thief's cell, familiars have always served. Whether through rigorous training or a preternatural connection, yours serves better than most.

# Familiar Master Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[[Archetype]]  [[dedication]]  


You have forged a mystical bond with a creature. This might have involved complex rituals and invocations, such as meditating under the moon until something crept out of the forest. Or maybe you just did each other a good turn, such as rescuing the beast from a trap or a foe, and then being rescued in turn. Whatever the details, you are now comrades until the end. You gain a familiar . If you already have a familiar, you gain the [[Enhanced Familiar]] feat.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the familiar master archetype.
