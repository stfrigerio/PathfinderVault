# Phonetic Training  *Feat 4*  
[[Archetype]]  [[skill]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Linguist Dedication]], expert in [[Society]]

You can pronounce and repeat words with near-perfect accuracy even if you don't understand their meaning, and you can write them down in a phonetic script that allows you or another creature with Phonetic Training to read it later. Even if the words are in a language with sound you can't pronounce, you can faithfully transcribe them.

Memorizing long sequences of words remains just as difficult as it is normally.

# Analyze Idiolect  *Feat 6*  
[[Archetype]]  [[skill]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Linguist Dedication]], expert in [[Deception]] and [[Society]]

You break down a specific individual's idiolect, memorizing their speech mannerisms and habits.

# Read Shibboleths  *Feat 7*  
[[Archetype]]  [[linguistic]]  [[skill]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Linguist Dedication]], master in [[Society]]

All communication is filled with slight tells and signals. If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, their regional words, pronunciation changes, and nonverbal cues provide you with a minor fact about their social environment, such as their hometown or certain groups they might belong to. If a target of this ability is being deceptive about their social environment, such as a commoner pretending to be a noble, they must attempt a [[Deception]], [[Society]], or appropriate [[Lore]] check against your [[Society]] DC, providing you a false minor fact consistent with their assumed identity on a success.

Once you've gleaned one or more true minor facts about a person, you can then incorporate these mannerisms into your speech to present yourself in a way that they find familiar. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to your [[Diplomacy]] and [[Deception]] checks with them.

# Crude Communication  *Feat 8*  
[[Archetype]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Linguist Dedication]]

Even if you don't speak a creature's language, you can rely on inflection, root words, and body language to infer rudimentary meaning. If you interact with a creature for at least 10 minutes and that creature can speak a language, the GM rolls a secret [[Society]] check with a DC appropriate for the language's rarity. On a success, you understand the gist of the meaning and can communicate basic concepts back to the creature; on a failure, you are mistaken or communicate incorrect concepts. If you're legendary in [[Society]], you can communicate instantly without needing to attempt a [[Society]] check; even if you didn't know the medium of communication the creature uses , you intuit this information as soon as they try to communicate.
