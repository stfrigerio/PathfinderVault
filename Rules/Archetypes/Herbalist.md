# Herbalist Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[[Archetype]]  [[dedication]]  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [[Nature]], [[Natural Medicine]]

You can create remedies and other herbal products. You gain the basic alchemy benefits , though they apply only for herbal items: alchemical items with the [[healing]] trait, plus antidote and antiplague. You gain batches of infused reagents per day equal to your level or half your level if you didn't make your daily preparations in the wilderness. Your advanced alchemy level for creating these is 1 and doesn't increase on its own.

You become an expert in [[Nature]] and can use [[Nature]] instead of [[Crafting]] to [[Craft]] herbal items. You don't need to be trained in [[Crafting]] or have the [[Alchemical Crafting]] feat to do so, and you can use [[healer's tools]] instead of alchemist's tools.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the herbalist archetype.

# Poultice Preparation  *Feat 4*  
[[Archetype]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Herbalist Dedication]]

When you create an herbal elixir, you can prepare it as a poultice instead. A poultice gains the [[oil]] trait  and loses the [[elixir]] and [[ingested]] traits. You can apply a poultice by Interacting with one hand.

When you apply a poultice, in addition to the item's normal effects, the recipient can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of [[persistent acid, bleed, or fire damage]], with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.

# Endemic Herbs  *Feat 6*  
[[Archetype]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Herbalist Dedication]], trained in [[Survival]]

During your daily preparations, you find medicinal plants endemic to your location. Until your next preparations, you can spend an additional batch of herbs to add a benefit to an item you create with your herbalism. The benefit of the special herbs affects the creature that the item is applied to; if the benefit is not immediate, it lasts for 1 minute unless otherwise stated. This adjustment counts as an additive , so you can't include another additive without spoiling the item.

- **Aquatic** Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves.
- **Arctic** For 1 hour, treat environmental [[cold]] effects as if they were one step less severe.
- **Desert** For 1 hour, treat environmental heat effects as if they were one step less severe.
