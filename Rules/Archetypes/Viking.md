# Viking *Dedication Level 2*  

To go "a-viking" is to raid by sea, and thus vikings have spread far and wide. Some have even settled in the very communities they once raided. Vikings traditionally travel in longboats; a score of these warriors might live aboard their ship for days at a time, sailing the seas  to ambush coastal communities. Once they arrive at a settlement, they charge ashore, plundering all they can find and slaying anyone foolish enough to get in their way. The ferocity of viking raids is legendary.

# Viking Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[[Archetype]]  [[dedication]]  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [[Athletics]]

Vikings spend long periods of time at sea, only to leap from their boats at a moment's notice, charge through the surf, and take their enemies by storm. You're trained in [[Sailing Lore]]. When moving through water using your land Speed, you ignore difficult terrain resulting from shallow water, such as in bogs or on beaches. In addition, if you roll a success for your [[Athletics]] check to [[Swim]], you get a critical success instead.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the viking archetype.

You can snap your shield into place just as you would take a blow, avoiding the hit at the last second. You immediately use the [[Raise a Shield]] action and gain your shield's bonus to AC.

You're used to your shield breaking in the middle of battle, and you're prepared to use a backup or any convenient nearby object to defend yourself. You can [[Interact]] to draw a shield on your person or an unattended shield within your reach. If there is an object within your reach that could serve as an improvised shield—for example, a table or chair— you can [[Interact]] to draw it with this feat. The GM determines if something can be used as an improvised shield. Your new shield isn't raised until you use the [[Raise a Shield]] action, as normal.
