# Zombie *Dedication Level 2*  

You are a zombie, a rotting corpse animated by necromantic magic. Although most zombies are mindless brutes, you're a husk zombie, preserved through necromantic rites and alchemical reagents. The process worked especially well on you, and you retained your intelligence and identity to a far greater degree than other husk zombies.

It's not easy being a corpse. Your body continues to rot and putrefy, and the stench is ever present. Your old self keeps slipping away, more and more as the weeks pass by. Your reflexes have slowed, you're beginning to lose your sense of touch, and your emotions are dulling. As your body continues to decay, so too, does your mind. Your memory's not perfect, and although you haven't noticed any huge gaps or flaws yet, you have a feeling they're there somewhere.

Unlike your other senses, your hunger has intensified. You ceaselessly crave the raw flesh and brains of the living—the smarter the better—and satisfying this hunger is the only thing that makes you feel alive. When you eat, you're reinvigorated; feeling returns and the constant mental torpor you live under vanishes. You feel like yourself again... for a time.

One day you might be nothing more than a walking corpse, but for now, you retain your personality and your free will. Feeding your hunger might allow you to remain that way.

# Zombie Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[[Archetype]]  [[dedication]]  [[rare]]  

- **Prerequisites**: You died and were animated as a husk zombie.

Despite your death and subsequent reanimation as a rotting corpse, you retain most of your mind and identity. Yet, it's always there: the hunger for the flesh and organs of the living. You gain the [[undead]] and [[zombie]] traits, and the basic undead benefits . Unlike a typical zombie, you're not [[mindless]]. Reduce all your Speeds by 5 feet. Your fist loses the [[nonlethal]] trait.

Because of its progressing state of decay, your body requires continual maintenance to remain at its best. Each day after your rest period, your body is deteriorated due to natural decay. Additionally, some zombie abilities allow you to push for a greater effect in exchange for a chance of deteriorating your body.

While your body is deteriorated, you're [[slowed]]. You can spend 10 minutes checking and repairing your joints and other weak parts of your body to recover from deterioration. You can perform these repairs as part of your daily preparations. Because it's a natural result of your body's functions, you can't remove the [[slowed]] condition from deterioration through any other means.

You crave the flesh of the living. You gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals `1d8` piercing damage. Your jaws are in the brawling group and have the [[unarmed]] trait. You can use your jaws [[Strike]] only against a creature that's [[grabbed]] or [[restrained]] by you.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the zombie archetype.
