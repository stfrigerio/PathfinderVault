# Bright Lion Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[[Archetype]]  [[dedication]]  [[uncommon]]  

- **Access**: [[Bright Lion]] background
- **Prerequisites**: member of the Bright Lions, not a worshipper of Walkena, trained in [[Stealth]]

You become trained in your choice of [[Deception]] or [[Diplomacy]] and in [[Mzali Lore]]; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You incorporate enough worship of Walkena in your daily life to avoid suspicion. You typically don't need to [[Lie]] or [[Impersonate]] to pass yourself off as a worshipper of Walkena. Against careful inspection, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to [[Deception]] checks specifically to pass yourself off as a version of yourself faithful to Walkena.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Bright Lion archetype.

# Warding Light  *Feat 4*  
[[Archetype]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Bright Lion Dedication]]

You gain a tattoo that serves as a special ward to defend you against Walkena's forces.

The tattoo allows you to cast the [[light]] cantrip as a divine innate spell at will. The cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. If you die, the tattoo immediately casts gentle repose on your corpse, heightened to the same spell level.

# Sun's Fury  *Feat 6*  
[[Archetype]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Bright Lion Dedication]]

The Old Sun Gods have granted you a gift in your fight against Walkena. You gain the sun's fury focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the [[Refocus]] activity to pray to the Old Sun Gods; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your Bright Lion focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, if you aren't already, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability score.

# Elude The Divine  *Feat 8*  
[[Archetype]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Bright Lion Dedication]]

You are able to escape inquisitions involving divine magic, allowing you to blend in well in Mzali but also to avoid unwanted attention in other oppressive theocracies. You gain the [[Slippery Secrets]] skill feat, and its benefits also apply against [[divination]] effects that attempt to discern your deity. When using Slippery Secrets against a divine divination, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and on a critical success, the divination reveals false information appropriate to your false persona, rather than nothing.
