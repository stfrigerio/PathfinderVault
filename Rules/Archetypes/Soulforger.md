[[uncommon]]  

Your devotion to a cause unifies your soul with an armament tethered to the very essence of your spirit.

## Essence Powers
<sup>SoM p. 236</sup>

Your soulforged armament has an essence power you choose when you first bind it. It gains the power temporarily when you manifest its essence form. Each power has a _Corruption Flaw_ that affects you if you have soulforged corruption. Essence powers that only apply to some types of armament indicate which.

**Adaptable Persona** ) Armor only. When you manifest the essence form, gain your choice of a climb Speed or swim Speed equal to your land Speed. If you're 8th level or higher, you can choose a fly Speed instead. _Corruption Flaw_ You take a –10-foot penalty to all your Speeds.

**Bounding Spirit** Melee weapon only. The weapon gains the [[thrown]] 30 feet trait and has the [[returning]] rune . _Corruption Flaw_ When you make a [[Strike]] with a thrown or ranged weapon and miss, reroll the [[Strike]], targeting your ally nearest to the target. This [[Strike]] uses the same multiple attack penalty as the missed [[Strike]] and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.

**Deep-Seeded Fear** You gain a +2 status bonus to your [[Intimidation]] checks and don't take any penalties for not sharing a language when [[Demoralizing]] foes who can perceive your armament's essence form. When you manifest the essence form, you can attempt to [[Demoralize]] an enemy who can perceive the manifestation. _Corruption Flaw_ If you attempt to [[Demoralize]] an enemy, your [[Demoralize]] also targets the ally closest to you.

**Determined Toughness** Any status penalties you take from the following conditions are 1 less than their condition's value: [[Clumsy]], [[Drained]], [[Enfeebled]], [[Frightened]], [[Sickened]], [[Stupefied]]. This doesn't change the actual condition value, or any other effects of the condition  disruption and its DC). _Corruption Flaw_ Whenever you take a status penalty from the listed conditions, you also take a –1 penalty to the same statistics.

**Harmful Malice** , [[negative]]) Your [[Strikes]] deal an additional `1d4` negative damage. Once while the armament is manifested, you can cast [[harm]] as an innate spell, with a level equal to half your level rounded up. _Corruption Flaw_ Reduce any damage you would deal by half your level.

**Heroic Heart** , [[mental]]) You gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, [[Perception]] checks, skill checks, and saves. _Corruption Flaw_ You take a –1 penalty to attack rolls.

**Healing Grace** , [[necromancy]], [[positive]]) You gain fast healing equal to half your level. You can cast [[heal]] once as an innate spell with a level equal to half your level rounded up. _Corruption Flaw_ Reduce all healing you would receive or grant with a spell by half your level.

**Magical Resilience** ) Armor or shield only. You gain a +2 status bonus to saving throws and AC against spells. If you're 5th level or higher, you can cast [[dispel magic]] once as an innate spell. The spell level is equal to 1 lower than half your level rounded up . _Corruption Flaw_ You take a –1 penalty to saving throws and AC against spells.

**Planar Bond** ) Armor or shield only. When you manifest the essence form, choose one damage type: acid, chaotic, cold, electricity, evil, fire, good, lawful, negative, positive, or sonic. You gain resistance equal to your level + 2 to damage of the selected type. _Corruption Flaw_ You gain weakness 1 to all damage.

**Planar Pain** ) Weapon only. When you manifest the essence form, choose one damage type: acid, chaotic, cold, electricity, evil, fire, good, lawful, negative, positive, or sonic. Attacks with the weapon deal this type of damage instead of their physical damage with a +2 status bonus to the damage. _Corruption Flaw_ When you deal damage with a weapon or unarmed attack, you take 2 damage of the last type you chose for planar pain, even if the damage type normally wouldn't harm you, such as good damage if you aren't evil.

**Pull of Stasis** ) Weapon only. Any time you hit with the soulforged weapon, the target takes a –10-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. On a critical hit, the creature is [[Immobilized]] for 1 round instead. _Corruption Flaw_ You take a –10-foot penalty to all your Speeds.

**Reflecting Spirit** Armor or shield only. You gain a +2 status bonus to AC against physical ranged attacks. If an enemy's physical ranged attack misses you, you can use your reaction to immediately attempt a ranged [[Strike]] against the attacker using the projectile that missed. _Corruption Flaw_ You have weakness 5 to physical ranged attacks.

**Resolute Defiance** Shield only. The shield gains a +2 status bonus to its Hardness and gains temporary Hit Points equal to your level + 2 that last until the essence effect ends. If you don't have the [[Shield Block]] reaction, you gain it while your shield is manifested. _Corruption Flaw_ When you take damage while [[Raising a Shield]] or use [[Shield Block]], attempt a DC 5 flat check. If you fail, the shield is Dismissed if it's your soulforged armament or Dropped if it's a different shield.
