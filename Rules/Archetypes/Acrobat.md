# Acrobat Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[[Archetype]]  [[Dedication]] 

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [[Acrobatics]]

You become an expert in [[Acrobatics]]. At 7th level, you become a master in [[Acrobatics]], and at 15th level, you become legendary in [[Acrobatics]]. Whenever you critically succeed at an [[Acrobatics]] check to [[Tumble Through]] an enemy's space, you don't treat the enemy's space as difficult terrain.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the acrobat archetype.

[[Archetype]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Acrobat Dedication]]

You can squeeze out of tight situations surprisingly quickly, gaining an advantage against foes that try to pin you down.

You gain the [[Quick Squeeze]] skill feat, and if you're a master in [[Acrobatics]], you can [[Squeeze]] at full Speed. Whenever you successfully [[Escape]] using [[Acrobatics]], the creature you [[Escaped]] from is [[flat-footed]] against the next attack you make against it before the end of your next turn.

You use your acrobatic prowess to evade an attack, using momentum to keep yourself moving, if you choose. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack.

If the attack misses you, you can [[Step]] after the [[Strike]]. If you're a master in [[Acrobatics]], you can move 10 feet on this [[Step]] instead of 5 feet.

> - **Success** As critical success, but the enemy isn't [[flat-footed]] against the [[Strike]].
> - **Failure** You remain in your original space but can still [[Strike]].
> - **Critical Failure** No effect.
