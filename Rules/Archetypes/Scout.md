# Scout *Dedication Level 2*  

You're an expert in espionage and reconnaissance, able to skulk silently through the wilderness to gather intelligence, sneak through enemy lines to report to your comrades, or suddenly and decisively strike your foes. Your skills ease the difficulty of travel for you and your companions and keep you all on guard when you're approaching danger.

[[Archetype]]  [[flourish]]  

- **Prerequisites**: [[Scout Dedication]]

You meander around unpredictably, and then ambush your opponents without warning. Choose one enemy. [[Stride]], [[Feint]] against that opponent, and then make a [[Strike]] against that foe. For your [[Feint]], you can attempt a [[Stealth]] check instead of the [[Deception]] check that's usually required, because you use the terrain around you to catch your foe off-guard.
