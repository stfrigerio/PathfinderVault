# Rogue *Dedication Level 2*  

You've learned to sneak, steal, and disable traps. With time and luck, you'll become capable of moving through the shadows, striking unseen, and escaping without notice.

## Multiclass Rogue characters
<sup>CRB p. 229</sup>

Nearly any character can benefit from the many skills and tricks the rogue archetype grants.

- Alchemist rogues can use the rogue's Poison Weapon to great effect with their daily poisons, and sneak attack is a nice boost to bomb damage.
- Barbarian rogues can become masters in every save and diversify their skills.
- Champion rogues add damage from sneak attack while protecting their flanking partners from harm.
- Fighter rogues combine the fighter's accuracy with extra damage, a deadly combination for archers or finesse fighters.
- Monk rogues have great synergy, since many stances grant powerful [[Strikes]] that work with sneak attack.
- Ranger rogues benefit from the shared focus on trailing foes and catching them [[Flat-Footed]]. The flurry edge can get you many sneak attacks, and the precision edge doubles down on precision damage.
- Spellcaster rogues use the rogue multiclass to shore up skills or to pick up tricky rogue feats like Mobility to help keep them safe.
