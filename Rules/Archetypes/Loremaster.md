# Loremaster *Dedication Level 2*  

Knowledge is power, and you labor in pursuit of that power. No matter the situation, you can usually procure some tidbit of knowledge to inform your actions. You specialize in secrets, both uncovering them and hiding them away, and your command of the written word borders on the supernatural. As you discover deeper secrets of lore, you might develop a power over knowledge that becomes outright magical, allowing you to understand and disguise information even more effectively.

[[Archetype]]  [[dedication]]  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in at least one skill to [[Decipher Writing]]

You've compiled a vast repository of information that touches on nearly every subject. You are trained in [[Loremaster Lore]], a special [[Lore]] skill that can be used only to [[Recall Knowledge]], but on any topic. If you have legendary proficiency in a skill used to [[Decipher Writing]], you gain expert proficiency in [[Loremaster Lore]], but you can't increase your proficiency rank in [[Loremaster Lore]] by any other means. You can take feats in the loremaster's additional feats entry even if you don't meet the enigma muse prerequisite.

If you have the [[Bardic Lore]] class feat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with [[Bardic Lore]].

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the loremaster archetype.
