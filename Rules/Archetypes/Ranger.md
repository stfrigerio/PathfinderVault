# Ranger *Dedication Level 2*  

You have studied hunting, tracking, and wilderness survival, adding a ranger's tools to your skill set.

## Multiclass Ranger characters
<sup>CRB p. 228</sup>

The ranger archetype has access to excellent options to improve a character's monster knowledge and survival skills, but ranger is of particular interest to any character wanting to become a dedicated archer.

- Alchemist rangers can add snares to their daily free items, benefiting from a strong [[Crafting]] modifier, and their Intelligence makes them exceptional with monster knowledge feats. The ranger archetype is also useful to bombers who want to alternate with bow attacks.
- Champion rangers are particularly fitting for deities who connect thematically to nature or have a bow as their favored weapon. 
- Fighter rangers are among the most fearsome archers, combining the best archery feats from both classes to create a fighting style unique to each fighter ranger.
- Rogue rangers make excellent snipers or ranged skirmishers, and snares let them be on the other side of traps for a change.
- Spellcaster rangers benefit greatly from ranger's feat support, backing up their spells with ranged weapon attacks. Druids have the most thematic overlap with rangers among the spellcasters, allowing you to create a true master of the wilderness.
