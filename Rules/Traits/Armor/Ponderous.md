# Ponderous



> The armor has moving parts or other complications that lengthen the wearer's initial reaction time. While wearing the armor, you take a â€“1 penalty to initiative checks. If you don't meet the armor's required Strength score, this penalty increases to be equal to the armor's check penalty if it's worse.
