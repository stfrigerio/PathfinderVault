# Fighter  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 632*  


> No one can outperform a **fighter** when it comes to pure martial combat. Where mages battle with their [[Arcane|arcane]] powers and clerics through the gifts from their deity, fighters can hold their own with their strength of arms alone. In [[Golarion]], the life of a fighter is the primary recourse of a would-be adventurer. No study is needed, no blessings to be impartedâ€“all one needs is a sword and the will to excel and become better.
> Unlike the more common [[Warrior|warrior]], the fighter is more than just someone familiar with the arts of war. They are beyond the ken of simple sword-wielding soldiers, often (but not always) having attended military academies or private schools, such as those in [[Brevoy]]. They are tougher, more skilled, and better prepared to face their foe. Their experience or training makes them excellent commanders on the battlefield and in the garrison. Although the military life is a suitable one, available in all nations of the world, it is not the only one afforded a fighter, nor is it always the most elegant. A fighter might be a mercenary, gang-member, or simply an adventurer.



## On Golarion

> Fighters journey forth from all nations. The larger nations, such as [[Andoran]], have renowned standing armies and guards. Even the less civilized areas and cultures produce excellent fighters, though often in accompaniment to other warrior classes. Fighters from private companies might be a member of the [[Hellknight (Book)|Hellknights]] of [[Cheliax]] and [[Varisia]], the [[Pure Legion]] in [[Rahadoum]], or in southern [[Brevoy]], birthplace of the [[Aldori swordpact]].
