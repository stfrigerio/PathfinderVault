### Invisible

While invisible, you can’t be seen. You’re [[Undetected]] to everyone. Creatures can Seek to attempt to detect you; if a creature succeeds at its [[Perception]] check against your [[Stealth]] DC, you become [[Hidden]] to that creature until you Sneak to become [[Undetected]] again. If you become invisible while someone can already see you, you start out [[Hidden]] to the observer (instead of [[Undetected]]) until you successfully Sneak. You can’t become observed while invisible except via special abilities or magic.
