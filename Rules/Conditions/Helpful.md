### Helpful

This condition reflects a creature’s disposition toward a particular character, and it affects only creatures that are not player characters. A creature that is helpful to a character wishes to actively aid that character. It will accept reasonable Requests from that character, as long as such requests aren’t at the expense of the helpful creature’s goals or quality of life. If the character or one of their allies uses a [[Hostile]] action against the creature, the creature gains a worse attitude condition depending on the severity of the [[Hostile]] action, as determined by the GM.
