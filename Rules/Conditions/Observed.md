### Observed

Anything in plain view is observed by you. If a creature takes measures to avoid detection, such as by using [[Stealth]] to Hide, it can become [[Hidden]] or [[Undetected]] instead of observed. If you have another precise sense instead of or in addition to sight, you might be able to observe a creature or object using that sense instead. You can observe a creature only with precise senses. When Seeking a creature using only imprecise senses, it remains [[Hidden]], rather than observed.
