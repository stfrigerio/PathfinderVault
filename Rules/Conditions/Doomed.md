### Doomed

A powerful force has gripped your soul, calling you closer to death. Doomed always includes a value. The [[Dying]] value at which you die is reduced by your doomed value. If your maximum [[Dying]] value is reduced to 0, you instantly die. When you die, you’re no longer doomed.
Your doomed value decreases by 1 each time you get a full night’s rest.
