[Position Image Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme/main/Images/Image_Adjustments-Simple-Positions.png)

Attribute

Description

`left`

Move the image to the left.

`right`

Move the image to the right.

`center`

Move the image to the center.

Position Attributes will not work in Live Preview

This causes issues with editing notes so it is and will not be natively supported by me unless that stops occurring. If you're okay with these potential issues, include theÂ `|lp`Â option to allow it in Live Preview.

I will not attempt to fix any issues that arise out of the use ofÂ `|lp`. If something goes wrong with your notes with my theme or snippet, try removing this option before reporting that issue.
