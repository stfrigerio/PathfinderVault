At the conclusion of this record of national wounds, the country's eleven other council members join Oblosk in renewing their yearly vow to neither forget nor forgive the Gebbites' atrocities and to again swear in their lost ruler's name to endlessly wage war against their ancient enemies.\n\nOn this day, known as Conquest Day, all the people of Nex are expected to share in their leaders' oaths, to celebrate the shared patriotism of their wondrous nation, and to remember the sacrifices of heroes past. This also makes it a day for many Nexian wizards to reveal deadly new spells, gigantic constructs, and audacious arcane masterworks—which many creators promise to be the doom of their foes. Even throughout the rest of the Inner Sea region, many crusaders, rebels, and zealots observe Conquest Day as a day to renew blood oaths, launch long-planned battles, and finally take revenge.

They are primarily a national holiday and not truly a religious one, but the two are often confused due to Cheliax's current political climate. Various contests and blood sports are held on these days, promoting those elites who can clearly demonstrate their superiority over others. Some believe that these competitions are watched and judged by devils themselves. In the parts of the world where the Prince of Darkness is not openly venerated, these holidays take on a different tone: they are used to settle old grievances and also to end contracts.\n\nIn these days, bloodsports are organized into cities' stadiums. Slaves and servants of any master may choose to enter the arena for one-on-one bloody battles to the death. Free men and women of all classes are free to enter the arena as well. The entrants fight in rounds until at last one stands alone. The winner is granted freedom from slavery or servitude, erasure of all debts, and a purse of gold.\n\nThe winter solstice sees the culmination of the Dies Irae, with all the winners of the three previous bouts summoned to Egorian to fight to the death for the amusement of the nobles.

Every year on the 15th of Gozran, priests of the church of Abadar spend the day walking city streets, doing what they can to make the bitter pill of annual taxes a bit easier to swallow.\n\nThe Business of the Day\n\nFrom dawn to dusk, clerics of Abadar attend the tax collectors of sizeable communities as the tax wagons roll from door to door. The church officials monitor these activities to make sure that the process is conducted respectfully and justly, and that citizens know that the process is monitored. More than just aiding in the yearly errand, the faithful personally thank every citizen for contributing to the improvement of their city, extol the public works funded by their contributions, and foretell the grandeur of civic projects to come. The disenfranchised and destitute they attempt to comfort as best they can, quoting from their god's dogma on work and worthiness, but this is not a day for discounts or deferrals. The citizens are able to voice their concerns and ideas as to where the monies levied should best be applied. Citizens are free to speak their mind on any issue here without fear of repercussion.\n\nThe Celebrations of the Day\n\nAt dusk, the Abadarans host several celebrations in parks, plazas, and other communal areas about the city, organizing donations and contributions from local vendors to feed and entertain all-comers. Having already preached to most of the city over the course of the day, the clerics perform only a brief opening ceremony, dedicating the feast to Abadar, the city, and its great people. These celebrations are often quite distinct from neighbourhood to neighbourhood and are almost always divided along economic boundaries.\n\nThe festivities involving the wealthiest citizens usually happen on the steps of city hall or other grand civic buildings and feature the best music and food, but often little more than polite card and guessing games. These galas usually wrap up by midnight.\n\nFor the common folk, the parks and marketplaces take on a carnival atmosphere, with simple but good food, local ales, performances by talented citizens, and games of chance going on well into the night. A prevailing superstition through these festivals is that, during the celebration, it is lucky to kiss—or in some regions, pinch—a cleric of Abadar, leading to many a rosy-cheeked cleric.\n\nEven the city's poor are given reason to celebrate, as the local temple of Abadar hosts a cheery but unabashedly religious gathering on its steps, feeding all comers, doling out a hearty ration of wine, singing hymns of the faith, and providing tokens for a second wine ration for any who return to attend a service within the month.\n\nFor a holiday that revolves around paying taxes, this Abadaran festival is not as reviled as one might expect.","id":"1730833","note":null,"date":{"day":15,"year":null,"month":3},"category":null},{"name":"Wrights of Augustana","description":"Andoran, Brigh\n\nThis local festival in the Andoran port city of Augustana is held to honor and celebrate the local shipbuilding industry as well as the navy.

Archery competitions are held frequently in which the men test their skill with the bow through progressively harder trials. The exact form of competition is different from place to place, and the winner is awarded a rack of elk horns and a quiver of blessed arrows. He is also given the title of \"Protector\", which he holds until the next year.\n\nWhile the festival's traditions emphasize contests of marksmanship, most have expanded to exhibit talents of all types, from baking and storytelling to racing and mock combat. Aside from encouraging a fair-like atmosphere, many of the displays and competitions serve one of two secondary purposes: either as a way for merchants to show off their superior livestock and wares, or (more popularly) as a way for eligible men and women to show off to each other.\n\nWhile the day's events at most Archerfeast fairs are filled with games, food, and crafts, the night brings dancing, drinking, pranks, and the crowning of the princes and princesses of spring and summer for the two single youths and two single adults who fared best in the day's events.

The day marks the anniversary of the day Iomedae took the Test of the Starstone in the autumn of 3832 AR and ascended to godhood.\n\nCelebration\n\nThe day is a joyous celebration for the faithful, with singing, pledging of friendships, and forgiving of old grudges.\n\nTo many, the Test of the Starstone represents the greatest of all challenges, yet for Iomedae it was one of three storied promotions in her rise from Aroden's herald to a goddess in her own right. On the 6th of Lamashan, the Inheritor's faithful observe the heroism of Iomedae's life before her moment of ascension and celebrate the anniversary of the apotheosis itself.\n\nThe celebration takes place in several stages. Early in the day, troupes of performers—as often passionate amateurs as professionals—stage morality plays featuring the Eleven Acts of Iomedae, the heroic near-miracles and sacrifices she made leading up to her trials in the Starstone Cathedral. Scripts vary by region, city, and even neighborhood, but despite differences in setting, performance medium, and word choice, the themes and morals are all the same.\n\nAs the day continues, the priests organize jousts and mock battles, allowing anyone to participate so long as she can demonstrate enough skill to not be a risk to herself or others. The winners of these contests then face tests of mental acuity such as solving riddles, deciphering philosophical quandaries, and answering questions of honor and justice. Those who prove themselves in both contests are awarded a white cloak—representing the Inheritor at peace—styled after Iomedae's own red garment to wear for the rest of the celebration. Feasting and singing follow the competitions, mirroring the jubilation that followed Iomedae's ascension. This is occasion for making pledges of friendship and forgiving enemies, and priests circulate about the crowd offering the Inheritor's blessing to those who do and providing a moment's counsel or mediation for those who need an extra nudge.\n\nThe celebration typically ends before midnight, and the following day the priests and previous day's champions gather up the blunted swords from the mock battles, sharpen them, and distribute them among the church's armory and those of like-minded organizations so that all may remain vigilant against evil and prepared to strike it down.","id":"1730861","note":null,"date":{"day":6,"year":null,"month":9},"category":null},{"name":"Bastion Day","description":"Solku\n\nBastion Day is a two-day festival held annually on 19 and 20 Lamashan in the Katapeshi town of Solku honoring the founding of the town, when it is traditional to host a stranger from one noon until the next.","id":"1730862","note":null,"date":{"day":19,"year":4712,"month":9},"category":null},{"name":"Jestercap","description":"Andoran, Druma, Taldor\n\nJestercap occurs at the end of the month of Lamashan, traditionally on the 27th (although a few regions have taken to moving the exact day around slightly so it always falls on the last Starday of the month, allowing people who wish to celebrate in excess to have the following day of rest to recover).\n\nHistory\n\nWhile Jestercap has been embraced with excited open arms by the gnome communities of the Inner Sea region, its original genesis is said to have been in one of Taldor's coastal cities not long after King Aspex the Even-Tongued broke from the nation, significantly weakening Taldor's power and beginning that nation's long decline. The holiday was originally intended to distract the distraught Taldan populace with a night of revelry and comedic entertainment, but the antics of jesters were simply not enough.\n\nOver the course of the first few years, Jestercap evolved from a holiday of observation to a holiday of participation. Today, the holiday is a time where anyone can pull pranks or jokes or japes on companions, on neighbors, and (most typically) on rivals, with the understanding that provided no lasting harm is done, any humiliations inflicted before midnight are to be taken in stride. Of course, come morning the day after, there are inevitably jokes that went too far, and grudges and feuds borne from Jestercap antics have a way of lingering for months to follow.\n\nIn Religion\n\nFollowers of Chaldira Zuzaristan, a halfling deity of mischief, treat Jestercap as a holy day and their pranks — often elaborate and extravagant in nature and plotted for months in advance — as displays of their faith.","id":"1730863","note":null,"date":{"day":27,"year":null,"month":9},"category":null},{"name":"Feast of the Survivors","description":"Zon-Kuthon, Nidal\n\nA harvest festival signifying the centuries of Nidalese ancestors protected by Zon-Kuthon.

The evening traditionally closes out with the Seven Veil masquerade, a ball wherein the participants wear disguises that hide their race or gender (often using minor magical trinkets and spells) or disguise these features as entirely new characteristics. At the end of the ball, the participants remove their disguises to their partners, often with unpredictable and sometimes delightfully awkward results. Traditionalists and conservative minds often find the Seven Veils masquerades to be scandalous or off-putting, yet they remain particularly popular in most of the larger cities of the land.\n\nHistorians note that the original \"Dance of the Seven Veils\" has a much different genesis than one promoting diversity — the mysterious cult of Sivanah, goddess of illusions, mystery, and reflections, is generally cited as the source of this festival, and indeed, worshippers of the goddess (herself known as the Seventh Veil) count the 23rd of Neth as one of their most sacred of days. What rituals the church of Sivanah performs on this date, however, are unknown to outsiders, for the cult enjoys its secrets. This secrecy has, unsurprisingly, given rise to all manner of sinister rumour, yet when Seven Veils rolls around each year, its eager participants are quick to set aside rumour in preference for the night's fun and games.","id":"1730867","note":null,"date":{"day":23,"year":null,"month":10},"category":null},{"name":"Abjurant Day","description":"Nethys\n\nAbjurant Day occurs on 8 Neth and is known as a day of cooperation between neighbors to shore up mutual defenses and train allies in magic.

Since the death of Aroden and the loss of these nations, the holiday instead marks the loss of territory and glory once held by Cheliax.

Evoking Day is observed on the 18th of Neth, and while this holiday is mostly celebrated in Garund, temples dedicated to Nethys host celebrations throughout the Inner Sea region. Traditional celebrations of Evoking Day have changed over the thousands of years since its first incarnation, but to this day every occurrence of Evoking Day still features a grand meal shared by celebrants during the afternoon and a wondrous exhibition of brilliant and explosive magic once the sun sets. These days, such colorful magical displays are augmented with fireworks of a dozen different colors and patterns.\n\nIn temples of Nethys dedicated to revering evocation magic, priests and prominent arcanists participate in spell duels where each contestant stands on a raised platform and takes turns trying to incapacitate her opponent. The magic wielded in theses duels favors the flashy over the dangerous, but clerics of Nethys are on hand to treat any injuries. These duels gather large crowds eager to lend their applause to their favorite contestant.\n\nIt is also during this festival when wizards who worship Nethys open their spellbooks to others who share their craft. Wizards normally guard their spellbooks with their lives and covet the eldritch information therein, but on Evoking Day these wizards meet with one another prior to the afternoon feast to share their spells just as they prepare to share a grand meal.\n\nThough Evoking Day is primarily a day of grand magic, those with no spellcasting talent still flock to local temples of Nethys to partake in the shared feast and flashy evening displays of magic and fireworks. Between the meal and into the night, celebrants wear black-and-white robes and perform joyous dances meant to give thanks to the wonders Nethys brought to humankind. These dances are grand affairs involving dozens of dancers all spinning and clapping to the accompanying music as their black-and-white robes fan out around them with each spin. As night descends and the fireworks and magical displays begin, the dancing rises to a climax erupting in shouts and calls to Nethys with each thunderous boom.","id":"1730871","note":null,"date":{"day":18,"year":null,"month":10},"category":null},{"name":"Baptism of Ice","description":"Irrisen\n\nIn the Irriseni Baptism of Ice, an annual fertility festival held from the 24th to the 30th of Neth, locals parade all children born during the year through the town in fine clothes.

Holidays worshiped by dark and sinister cults and religions tend to be hidden affairs, their rituals and ceremonies involving cruelties and vile practices that send shivers of fear through gentler society. Scholars suspect that the Night of the Pale—a holiday that traditionally takes place on the last day of the year, the 31st of Kuthona—has links to several sinister religions, but today no one church has specific association with the event. Nonetheless, the Night of the Pale is an event that many look forward to all year, whether in fear or excitement.\n\nOn the Night of the Pale, it is said that the ghosts of those who died during the previous year manifest upon the world and come to visit the homes they lived in during life. Although some might think that the chance of seeing even the shade of a dearly departed one might be a blessing, the Night of the Pale is not a time for tearful reunions, for these ghosts, tradition says, do not return out of love for those they left behind but out of darker compulsions. Lingering jealousy, unfinished arguments, or the simmering need for revenge are said to be what compels the dead to return to torment the living on the Night of the Pale.\n\nThe evening of this night in many communities is celebrated by a morbid feast, the food prepared with themes revolving around graveyards, the dead, and other spooky traditions. This feast, on one level, helps the celebrants to make light of their fears while sharing good company with similarly nervous neighbors, but at another level is believed to placate vengeful spirits as toasts are raised to the memories of the recently departed. These feasts include retellings of favorite memories of the departed, in hopes of reminding the approaching ghosts of brighter and kinder memories than those that compel them to return. The feast always ends at least an hour before midnight in order to give participants time to return home, decorate doors and windows with salt and other trinkets taken from the feasting table (salted bread baked into crook-like shapes are a favorite, as these can be hung from doorknobs and eaves) to ward off evil spirits, and hide in their bedrooms until dawn. Brave youths and adventurers often deliberately stay out after midnight, either to dare the ghosts to challenge them or simply for the thrill of bucking tradition. Every Night of the Pale, it seems, there are disappearances among those who stay out after midnight, although whether these vanishings are the result of dissatisfied locals taking the opportunity to run away from home, murderers or wild animals or other mundane dangers, or the vengeful spirits carrying off their victims depends upon the circumstances.\n\nThe morning after a Night of the Pale is also the first day of the new year—a time that many celebrate more as a relief for surviving the night before than in anticipation of what the new year might bring, although regional preferences for how this day is celebrated vary enough that no single tradition holds over the other. Save, of course, the lingering fears of what dread spirits might come knocking upon warded doors one year away...","id":"1730880","note":null,"date":{"day":31,"year":null,"month":11},"category":null},{"name":"Turning Day","description":"Alseta\n\nThe changing of the year is celebrated with the forgiveness of old debts and grudges, and embracing new opportunities.","id":"1730881","note":null,"date":{"day":31,"year":null,"month":11},"category":null},{"name":"Ritual of Stardust","description":"Desna\n\nThe Ritual of Stardust is one of the few formal religious holidays in honor of the goddess Desna.

After it is fully dark, the celebrants chant and sing songs as they watch the fires burn low. When only embers remain, sand mixed with ground star gems (either star rubies, star sapphires, or rose quartz) is thrown on them or into the air downwind. At this point it is common to make proclamations of love and friendship and of promised journeys to come.
