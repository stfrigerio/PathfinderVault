### d12 Entertainment

1.  A poor farmer is trying to pay his bar tab with a sack of potatoes and a barrel of pickles.
    
2.  A sea captain has set up shop at a table and is trying to sell mementos and souvenirs from his latest great voyage of exploration. Birds, exotic coins, tiny mermaids, he has it all. Some of it looks fake though. A tiny bit looks disturbingly real.
    
3.  A ranger sits alone in a corner, smoking. A hood covers most of his face. At his feet is a sleeping wolfhound. Everyone is giving him a wide berth.

2.  Tonight's special cocktail: Suckerpunch. Each glass of this potent purple-red punch has several small writhing tentacles that reach out of the glass to attach to your face with their suckers. It actually feels kind of nice.

5.  Tonight's special cocktail: Fireball. Served by wizards of 5th level or higher.

14.  A knife splits the bulls eye of the elves' in-progress dart game. The elves draw bows and start shooting the place up.
