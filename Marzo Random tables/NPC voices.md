# NPC Voices Generator

This table is to give ideas for various character voices for NPCs. This is not about accents, just what you can do within a certain accent. Speed, pitch, and texture are the most basic ways to change up voices. The Speech patterns and mannerisms are to further distinguish between characters both for you and your PCs.
